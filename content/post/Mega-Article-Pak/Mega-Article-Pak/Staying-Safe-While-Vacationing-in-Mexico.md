Staying Safe While Vacationing in Mexico

Taking precaution for your safety is the best way to prevent a tragedy from occurring while vacationing in Mexico.  By taking the time to familiarize yourself with safety precautions, you should be able to have a safe and enjoyable vacation while in Mexico.

When traveling, it is important to make sure that you do not bring large amounts of cash, excess credit cards, or flashy jewelry with you.  You will already draw attention to yourself, just because you are a tourist; don’t draw additional attention to yourself by flashing large amounts of cash when out on the town.  There are many people who are looking for unsuspecting targets.  You need to protect yourself from those who are out to rob or hurt you.  Use common sense and behave wisely while in Mexico. Doing so will likely lower your chances of becoming a victim of crime.

Though it is very important to make sure that you are using good judgment and common sense to protect yourself from becoming a victim of a crime, it is also important to make sure that you protect yourself physically while in Mexico as well.

The water found in the United States is different than the water found in Mexico.  To protect yourself and prevent any serious illnesses, you urged to only drink bottled water.  

Along with water, you should also make sure that you use safety precautions with the food that you eat.

However, there are times that you may want to take advantage of the local food.  When doing so, you should practice safe handling instructions for food, like you do back home.  Take the time to thoroughly clean fruits and vegetables before eating them.  If you are going to eat dairy products from the locals, there is a good possibility that the products are non-pasteurized.  This means that you should always use caution when choosing what foods you eat in Mexico.  

Health insurance is another important factor to consider when you are visiting Mexico.

You are advised to check with your individual insurance carrier to see if you will be covered while in Mexico.  If not, it may be possible that you can add additional coverage to your policy.  You can also purchase temporary health insurance that will cover you while you are on vacation.  Whatever health insurance method you choose, make sure that you take care of your health insurance needs before you embark on your journey.

To stay safe, on a number of different levels, you are encouraged to keep the above mentioned precautions in mind.  For additional information on staying healthy in Mexico, you may want to speak with your family physician.
