Caring for Dogs that are Hypoallergenic for Humans

Hypoallergenic dog breeds have special needs because they are usually smaller in size and have temperaments that may be difficult to handle sometimes. When you first bring your new dog home, you should allow it to roam around to get an idea of its surroundings. If you have other pets, you should put them in another room while the dog is investigating the area. Depending on the breed of dog, they may be very scared at first. They may not want much human contact, so you should be careful about handling them too much during the first few days they are in your home.

Once you new dog becomes comfortable, you should develop a feeding and hair brushing routine that you and your dog will follow. If you have allergies, brushing your dog every day will reduce the amount of allergens in the air. This will reduce the allergens on your carpets, furniture, clothing, and walls. Buy a steel comb with wide teeth that will help trap hair and get out any knots that may be in the dog’s fur. If you purchased a Mexican hairless or other breed that does not have hair, you should make sure that its skin is not dry. If you notice flaking, you should visit your vet who will prescribe medication or lotion that you can use.

Making sure your hypoallergenic dog gets plenty of exercise is important for their health and also for controlling allergens in your home. Walking your dog at least once a day and making sure it sleeps through the night will keep the dog on a routine. Dogs that are awake at night time may want to be with you. Allowing your dog to sleep on your bed could increase your risk of an allergy attack. 

Your dog should have a designated place to sleep during the night and during the day. Buying a soft bed or giving the dog an old blanket will help keep them warm and safe when they are sleeping. You should wash their pet bed often to prevent allergens from being transferred to carpeting or clothing. While you cannot prevent all allergens from getting into your clothing and inside your carpeting, you can reduce them by keeping everything in your home clean.

Dog grooming is also important when caring for a hypoallergenic dog. Even though the breed that you buy will probably have short hair, you will have to have it professionally groomed every few months to maintain the shape and also to keep the hair from becoming too long. Since hair can grow long and cover the dog’s eyes, and make it difficult for the dog to keep itself clean, grooming your dog will ensure that it remains healthy and happy. 

Now that you know more about caring for a hypoallergenic dog, you should remember that just because these dogs are considered a good choice for those with allergies, these dogs may still cause you to have allergy attacks from time to time. Hypoallergenic dogs reduce the risk of attacks, but cannot prevent them from occurring.
