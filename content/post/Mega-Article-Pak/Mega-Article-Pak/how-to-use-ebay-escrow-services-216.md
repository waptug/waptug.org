How to Use eBay Escrow Services

If you buy or sell big ticket items on eBay, you need 
to know about the available escrow services. An 
escrow service is designed to protect buyers and 
sellers from being ripped off. The funds for the sale 
go to the escrow service, and then the seller ships 
the item to the buyer. Once the item has been 
received, the funds are released from the escrow 
service to the seller. 

In some instances, both the item and the funds go
through the escrow service, and the service makes 
sure that the buyer gets the item, and the seller 
gets the money. There is a small fee for the service, 
and it is usually a fixed percentage of the sale price. 
It is up to the buyer and seller to decide who will 
pay the fees. Often, the fees are split between the 
buyer and seller.

If you want to use an escrow service, there is only 
one service that eBay recommends, and they back 
that service up. This service is Escrow.com. Over 
the years, there have been many ‘look-alike’ 
escrow services, using variations of the escrow.com 
domain name, but they have shown to be less than 
reputable companies. Make sure you use the 
services of escrow.com for the greatest protection.
