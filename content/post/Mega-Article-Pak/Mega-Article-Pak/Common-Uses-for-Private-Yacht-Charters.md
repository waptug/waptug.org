Common Uses for Private Yacht Charters

Have you heard of a private yacht charter before?  If you haven’t, you may be wondering exactly what one is. Better yet, you may be wondering what exactly warrants the chartering of a private yacht.  In all honesty, it depends.  There are a number of different reasons why people choose to charter private yachts.  Just a few of those reasons are outlined below.

Before examining the many uses of a privately chartered yacht, it is first important that you know exactly what it entails. When it comes to sailing the open seas, many individuals, couples, families, and groups of friends choose to book a vacation on a cruise ship. While cruise ships are nice, one of the biggest complaints is that many are overcrowded.  To avoid the overcrowding and lack of personal space, a large number of individuals started looking for alternatives.  What they found was the chartering of a private yacht. When you make the decision to charter a private yacht, you are not only given your own personal yacht, but you are also given a trained staff; a staff that includes a captain. Essentially, this means that you get to enjoy a private vacation aboard a private yacht, without having to do any of the work!  

As you can see, the chartering of a private yacht has a lot of appeal to it.  That is why a large number of individuals are making the decision to do it.  What is amazing is that a large number of individuals charter private yachts for many different reasons.  Perhaps, one of the most common reasons is for a romantic getaway.  As it was previously mentioned, privately chartered yachts are just that, private.  When on a romantic getaway, there are many couples who want privacy; privacy where they can publicly display their affection for each other.  A private yacht rental is the perfect environment for a romantic getaway.

In conjunction with romantic getaways, there are also a number of individuals who charter private yachts for their honeymoons.  As it was mentioned above, private yachts are private.  Privacy is also something that is sought after on most honeymoons.  It is also important to note that yachts are often associated with luxury.  Luxury is also something that many couples search for, when on a honeymoon. They want a honeymoon that they can forever remember and the chartering of a private yacht is just perfect.

In addition to enjoying a romantic honeymoon aboard a privately chartered yacht, a number of couples are also making the decision to get married aboard one. One of the reasons for that is because getting married aboard a beautiful yacht is often considered the perfect scenery or backdrop for a wedding. When getting married on a privately chartered yacht, there are many individuals who choose to have the ceremony when the yacht is still docked at a port. This often allows many of their friends and family to still be able to participate in or view the wedding ceremony. After the ceremony has ended, there are many newlyweds who then hit the seas for their honeymoon.

Privately chartered yachts are also being used by families who are looking for a peaceful, quite, and unique vacation.  The chartering of a private yacht is something that not everyone gets to experience in their lives.  That is why many parents wish to provide their children with a memory that will last forever.  When it comes to using a chartered yacht for a family vacation, it is not uncommon to hear of some companies that have age requirements, but many allow children of all ages aboard their ships.  However, passengers are always urged to remember that the yacht staff is not to be used as childcare.

As you can see, there are a number of different uses for a privately chartered yacht.  In fact, there are some individuals who use privately chartered yachts for small business meetings or parties.  Essentially, for you, this means that whatever your purpose, you should be able to do it aboard a privately chartered yacht.
