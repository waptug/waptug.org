Exercise As Power Source

This day and age it can be very difficult indeed to
go to the gym.  Life is very hectic and busy, which
will create a serious challenge for remaining 
consistent with exercise each day.  Exercise is 
however, just what we all need to reduce stress,
and give the body the extra energy it needs to carry
out normal living.

The best results of exercise are achieved through
the use of refined techniques, functional exercises,
cardio, the right nutrition, variety, awareness, 
consistency, and motivation over a period of time.

The refined techniques mean correct form to isolate
muscles or to target areas of the body.  Efficiency
is need to ensure stimulation of the muscles.  With
weight lift training, which is also known as 
resistance training, you'll need to eliminate any
type of momentum.  

It is also important to move the weight about using
a full range of motion.  Full range of motion causes
the muscle to contract for the right amount of time
and help to ensure the right length of the tendons.
The goal here is to strengthen the joints of your
body by stimulating the muscles.

Cadence is also helpful, as it is a term that refers
to the rate in which the resistance or the weight
moves.  The best results with cadence are gained
by slow movements which will cause the muscle
to contract for a longer period of time.  You
can mix in a series of fast and slow cadence,
which is very beneficial with sports type 
training.

Using the correct angles will achieve muscle
isolation in target areas and help to decrease
the risk of injuries, which is great for those
using heavy weights.  

Functional type exercise is a popular technique
that will stimulate the core and torso of your
body while you work on another muscle group at
the same time.  As an example, when you perform
a dumbell press while lying on an exercise ball.

Your abdominal muscles and the core muscles will
contract to hold your body into this position,
while your chest and tricep muscles will push the
dumbells up.  This type of exercise and challenge
will cause maximum stimulation to your body and
keep the workout interesting and refreshing.

Cardio is another exercise that is great for the
heart and lungs.  The total number of calories
you burn is very important along with maintaining
the right heart rate.  The formula for your 
heart rate is 220 minus your age times 60 for
the lower number, then 220 minus you age and
times 80 for the upper number.  

This is also known as fat burning zone.  Cardio
will also de-toxify the body and help to strengthen
the immune system along with other benefits.  The
muscles will contract and pass the lymph along,
which will allow the immune system to clear away
dead cells and bring new ones in.

Anytime you exercise, warming up is very important,
as it will prepare your body for the more 
demanding workout of cardio.  You should always
allow 15 - 30 minutes prior to weight lifting and
10 - 15 minutes prior to cardio exercises.  You
should also stretch as well, as this will help
get the blood flowing through your musles and
get them limber as well.

An ideal schedule for working out is to warm
up then follow with cardio.  You can lift weights
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday then cardio
only on Tuesday and Thursday.

Even though you may think your schedule is simply
too busy to maintain a schedule for working out,
you'll find that adding exercise will actually add
more time, as you'll have a lot more energy in
your normal everyday life.  You can think of
exercise as the batteries that will help to give
your life power.
