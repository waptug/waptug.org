A Look At Kung Fu

The martial art of Kung Fu is an exchange of culture, a type of exercise, and also a way of defending yourself.  The art is very popular throughout the world, also being known as Gung Fu, Wu Shu, and even Kuo Shu.  It shares some common traits with Karate, such as using both hand and foot techniques.  Kung Fu is one of the most popular forms of martial arts - and also one of the oldest.

Within Kung Fu, there are several styles and variances, although the most popular are those that have their roots in the well known Shaolin Temple.  What most people aren’t aware of however, is the fact that Kung Fu was practiced in China years before the first Shaolin temple was even though of.

A majority of martial arts enthusiasts think of self defense as being the ultimate goal of any martial art, including Kung Fu.  While self defense is involved with Kung Fu, the martial is so much more than just fighting and defense - it is a true art, one that develops the mind, body, and the soul.

Kung Fu doesn’t teach students to overcome others, as it teaches students to look within themselves and learn to have complete and total control over their emotions.  Kung Fu is an art of harmony, that teaches to students to remain at peace and avoid confrontations.  If a situation threatens bodily harm to the student, then he must rise to the occasion - becoming the warrior and defending himself.

Just like other types of martial arts, Kung Fun teaches the balance that is crucial for executing techniques and the proper movement.  The basic concept behind the balance is that same balance that the Chinese believe keeps the balance between heaven and earth.  This concept of balance can be achieved by students if they completely focus their thoughts and empty their minds free from any type of distractions.

Kung Fu is a martial art that can be learned by anyone.  It does take a strong desire, just like any other martial art.  It has a rich heritage, and a proud legacy.  Kung Fu is indeed a deadly martial art, if used in the wrong ways.  There are variations of Kung Fu as well, which include the infamous five animals - Tiger, Dragon, Eagle Claw, Crane, and the Snake.  

Adapted by the animals in which they are named after, the five animals style is some of the most impressive in martial arts.  Tiger Claw is by far the deadliest of the five animals, teaching students to strike just like the dreaded tiger.  This style teaches the student power in his hands, so that when he strikes, he tears the flesh.  Tiger Claw is very deadly, although it is very hard to find instructors that teach this style now days.

Unlike other martial arts, there really are no competitions for Kung Fu.  Stylists can compete it other competitions, although there really aren’t any that are for only Kung Fu.  It is an ancient martial art, that is to be used only in instances were there is no other option than to fight back.  When provoked, the stylist should try everything he or she can to avoid confrontations.

Kung Fu aims to teach the lessons of respect, fairness to others, harmony of the spirit, and total self control no matter what.  These characteristics, when paired together, allow students to achieve success in a hard to deal with society.  Kung Fu is all about developing the student’s overall well being - and following the straight path to mental and physical toughness.
