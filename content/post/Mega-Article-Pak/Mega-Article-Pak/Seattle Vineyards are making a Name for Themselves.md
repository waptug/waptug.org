Seattle Vineyards are making a Name for Themselves

Visiting Seattle Washington is a great way to get in touch with your inner explorer. Not only can you get out and explore mountains, prairies, streams, rivers, and oceans, but you can also explore the city streets that make this city what it has become. With so many things to do and places to go it seems impossible really to entertain the idea of sleep. Who has time for mundane activities such as that when there is a world of knowledge and beauty to explore right outside your hotel doors? 

For those among us who have a difficult time unwinding after a day spent shopping, hiking, biking, boating, whale watching, and sight seeing, perhaps you should consider a wine tasting before bed. This is a great way to relax and unwind. You may even find a new favorite among the wines that you are being exposed to. While many people think of California as wine country, Washington State has shown itself to be an impressive home for wine making as well. Of course you aren't looking to get tipsy, just relaxed enough that sleep can find you after a very exciting day.

Even if you elect to attend a wine tasting earlier in the day, perhaps you could pick up a bottle or two to bring back to your room with you. This will allow you to wine on hand at the end of a long day without the need to drive afterwards. Nor would you be required to get out of a cab, call a cab, or anything other than putting on your pajamas and heading off to bed. In fact, there is no rule that states you can't drink wine while wearing your pajamas either. I really can think of few better ways to relax after a long day of anything than to grab a good book and a glass of wine. Well maybe a massage, but now who's dreaming? Unless of course your hotel offers this service and you are willing to pay the price.

For a good nights sleep, however, I think a glass of wine is a much better price to pay. If that doesn't help, then grab a really boring book to read. The important thing about getting a good night's sleep is that it prepares you for the events of the next day. This is especially important if you have children. It is very doubtful that they are going to handle being cooped up in a hotel room while there are adventures to be had on the other side of the door. 

If you need more than one glass, go for it, you can always visit another winery tomorrow and buy another bottle. Rest is important although you do not want to drink enough that you wake up sick the next morning. That is definitely not the way to properly enjoy your vacation. Just so you know there are several great wineries in the region and it would actually be quite an adventure to visit as many of them as possible. Some of the more prominent wineries in and around Seattle are: Lopez Island Vineyards, Whidbey Island Vineyards and Winery, Bainbridge Island Vineyards and Winery, and Hoodsport Winery and Tasting Room. Some wineries and vineyards are only open to the public by reservation or during certain hours so be sure that you are aware and have planned accordingly before visiting. Another thing to keep in mind is that there are many more wineries in the Seattle area, these are only a small sampling of the vineyards that abound in these parts so don't limit yourself if these don't seem appealing to you. 

Sweet dreams are often born of good wine; I hope that you will find not only an excellent flavor to help you sleep but some great selections to bring home with you as well. And wine makes an excellent souvenir for loved ones who weren't able to travel with you or even gifts for friends who are getting married, buying homes, having babies, having birthdays, well being your friends. Wine is a great gift all around; even if it's a gift you give yourself.
