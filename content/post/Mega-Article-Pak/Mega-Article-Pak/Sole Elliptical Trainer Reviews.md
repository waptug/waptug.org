They have been in business for over twenty years, which is no wonder that they are making some very spectacular elliptical trainer machines, and you will notice their name frequently coming up in elliptical trainer reviews. 
	
One of the benefits of their machines is that their footpads have proper alignment. This is very important as your bodies alignment is usually thrown off when you use elliptical trainers, which is something that is not mentioned in elliptical trainer reviews.

In fact, Sole provides the only machine that can hold this type of weight capacity which makes it very appealing for overweight individuals who are trying to lose weight with a machine that will also help them feel comfortable during the entire workout. 
	
Sole also provides elliptical machines that offer some of the largest stride lengths, reaching up to twenty inches where other machines do not even exceed over sixteen inches. This is important, because the length of the stride for your arms not only helps you burn more calories, but it also benefits taller people. It is hard for people with long arms to use a elliptical machine that has a short stride length. In many elliptical trainer reviews, you will notice that the average stride length is anywhere form twelve to sixteen inches.
