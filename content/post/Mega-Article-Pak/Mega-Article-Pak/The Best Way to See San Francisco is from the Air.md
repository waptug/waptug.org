The Best Way to See San Francisco is from the Air

If you have plans of visiting San Francisco you really should consider seeing it from a birds eye view. There are many ways in which you can do this, but few, if any are more romantic than doing so from the basket of a hot air balloon. In fact, if you've never been in a balloon before, this is a great place to start. 

There are many tours that are offered and each one offers spectacular views and a feeling of weightless wonder that is unrivaled by any other feeling on earth. Imagine watching, as everything on the ground gets smaller and feeling completely at ease with the process. It's a truly amazing way to travel for those who have never experienced it. Young and old alike will thoroughly enjoy the awe of this particular form of travel. 

Some of the tours linger along the coastline while others will take you up into wine country. You can even charter tours that will combine the hot air balloon excursion with ground transportation and accommodations at one of the many area bed and breakfast inns for a nice romantic weekend get away in California's wine country. 

Another great way to enjoy the beautiful views that abound in the bay area is to go hang gliding. There are several places in the area that not only offer lessons but will also take you up with a trained professional after cursory instructions. This allows you to enjoy the sensation and freedom that hang gliding affords without spending days or even weeks taking classes before you ever get to experience the sensation of soaring with the birds.

If that isn't enough to get your adrenaline going and give you the best possible view of this great city, you can always try skydiving. Like hang gliding, sky diving offers tandem drops that mean that you can actually experience the freefall and enjoy the serene beauty of San Francisco without actually going through a rigorous training regiment. If you want the ride of a lifetime to make your trip more memorable, this is definitely the way to go. 

Of course, there are those who prefer flight by mechanical means. There is absolutely no shame in that. The good news is that there are a couple of great ways to take in the scenery with machinery as well. There's nothing to say that you can't make your mechanical experience just as daring as any of the other experiences available. You could view the great scenes of Frisco from the cockpit of a biplane. In addition to the awesome scenery, you are perfectly free to book on of the aerobatic biplane rides, which will be best planned before meals rather than after them. 

In addition to these exciting ways to tour the San Francisco area, you can always choose one of the many helicopter tours instead. This offers what many consider a more sane, I mean safe, mode of transportation while still providing the birds eye view that simply cannot be rivaled from the ground. There are many tours that are available and each one offers something exciting for the adventurous ones that choose to take them.

Each of these modes of transportation can be found in the San Francisco area and each one offers something valuable to those that will find them interesting. Not only the views but also the experiences in and of themselves will make this trip a memorable trip. Even if it isn't your cup of tea, remember that someone you are traveling with could find one of them to be the memory of a lifetime and what greater gift can you really give someone?

I hope, more than anything, I've planted the seeds in your mind that will open your eyes to seeing this great city from an entirely different perspective. There is nothing quite as magnificent as enjoying the city lights from the sky or seeing endless miles of nature stretching out before you. I truly believe there is no better way to enjoy San Francisco than from the sky.
