Advantages Of Diesel Engines

If you've owned a diesel powered vehicle in the
past or if you own one now, you no doubt appreciate
the qualities this engine provides you with.  More
torque, better fuel economy, and easier maintenance
are but a few of the attributes of owning diesel
powered vehicles.  

However, there are some motorists that still
complain about the engine's weak power, especially
when accelerating from a full stop.  What you
may not be aware of is the fact that a diesel 
engine can be tweaked to give more power without
harming the fuel economy.  

Diesel engines use air compression to create
combustion versus the fuel/air mixture that is
required by gas engines.  This attribute means
that diesel engines don't require spark plugs 
and therefore don't need to be tuned up.

Diesel fuel has a much high fuel density than
gas, which results in fuel economy increases
of 20 - 30% over gasoline powered vehicles.

Diesel engines are also cheaper to maintain as
they have less parts than that of a gasoline
powered engine.  The life span of a diesel
engine is also much longer.

If you're looking for torque, for pulling a 
boat or other equipment, then the diesel 
engine has the supreme advantage.  Diesel
engines are surely slower, especially when
starting from a dead stop, although when you
climb hills or go over bridges, the diesel
engine is surely up to the task.

With trucks, diesel is normally the leader
over gas engines in terms of performance and
miles per gallon.  Diesel trucks will get 
more miles than gas trucks, and the price for
diesel is a bit cheaper than gas these days.
And with gas prices on the rise, diesel will
continue to dominate for a long time to come.
