Disneyland Baby Centers

Disneyland is a place for everyone, and at 
Disneyland, they have thought of everything – 
including the babies. The Disneyland Baby Center 
is located on Main Street, behind the Plaza Inn. 
This is not a babysitting service. Instead, it is a place 
where you can attend to your babies needs.

There are several characters present in this area, 
and their purpose there is not only to amuse your 
baby, but also to help you attend to your baby’s 
needs. This area has rockers, where you can rock 
and breast feed your baby. No men are allowed in 
this room, but they are allowed in other rooms within 
the Baby Center. You can warm a bottle or a jar of 
food, and clean bottles as necessary. Baby changing 
tables are available, and the entire center is very 
clean and comfortable. There are even smaller toilets 
for children who are being potty trained.

You can also purchase emergency baby supplies at 
the Baby Center. Diapers cost about a dollar each, 
and several different types of formula and baby food 
are kept in supply, although the selections are l
imited. This is Disneyland’s way of making sure that 
the needs of every guest – no matter how small they 
may be – are attended to.
