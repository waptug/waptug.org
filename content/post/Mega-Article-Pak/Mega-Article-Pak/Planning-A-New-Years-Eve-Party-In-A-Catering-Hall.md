Planning a New Years Eve Party in a Catering Hall

For many who plan to host a New Years Eve party, hosting the party in a catering hall is a very popular option. There is certainly an increased expense associated with this option and more advanced planning required but many hosts enjoy this option because it greatly reduces the amount of work required by the host and also greatly reduces the responsibilities of the hosts on the evening of the party. In fact in most cases, the host’s only responsibilities during the party are to greet the guests, have a good time and thank the guests for coming at the conclusion of the party. This is appealing to many and is one of the major reasons why many party hosts opt to plan their New Years Eve party in a catering hall. This article will examine some of the logistics involved in hosting a New Years Eve party in a catering hall and will also explain how this option can make a party run very smoothly.

Two of the biggest concerns associated with planning a New Years Eve party in a catering hall are the costs associated with the party and the advance planning required to host the party. Any party which is hosted in a catering hall is likely to be significantly more expensive than a party hosted in the individual’s home because there is a fee for the use of the facility and the assistance of the staff. Additionally, the host is also often required to use the catering services for providing food and beverages for the guests. All of this can be especially expensive when hosting a New Years Eve party because of the popularity of the holiday. Catering halls are in high demand during this night and therefore most catering halls will charge a premium for their space and services on this particular night. 

Advance planning is also very important when planning a New Years Eve party in a catering hall. New Years Eve is an incredibly popular holiday and many catering halls are booked a year or even longer in advance. This means you have to plan well ahead if you wish to host a New Years Eve party in a particular location. If you have a particular catering hall in mind, it is a good idea to give them a call at least a year before you want to host the party and inquire about their availability. If they are not available for the following New Years Eve, you will have to decide if you want to wait until the next available New Years Eve to host your party or if you want to look at other locations. 

When planning a New Years Eve party in a catering hall, it is important to work closely with the staff of the catering hall to plan your entertainment. If you plan to hire a band or a DJ, you should consult the catering hall staff before making arrangements. They might have restrictions on entertainment and it is important to understand these restrictions before planning your entertainment. Restrictions may limit the noise level of the entertainment or may even limit the professional entertainers to a list of approved performers. Understanding these restrictions ahead of time will prevent problems on the day of the party which may occur if the entertainment violates any of the policies of the catering hall.

The food is also a very important consideration in planning a New Years Eve party in a catering hall. In most cases, the catering hall will require you to use their catering services for the food and beverages. They will likely have set menus you can choose from but they may also be willing to work with you to create a customized menu specifically for your New Years Eve party. Most catering halls also usually offer the host of the party the opportunity to taste several of the food options to make it easier to select a menu for the event. You may have the option of choosing a sit down dinner, a buffet, appetizers and desserts for your party.
