The Importance of Using Caution When Making Your Own Online Videos

Online videos have rapidly increased in popularity, especially over the past few years. Online, you should be able to find a number of different websites that are known as video websites. Two of the most popular video websites include Google Video and YouTube.  With video websites, you are not only able to view videos online, but you are also able to make, share, and upload your own.  If you are interested in doing this, there are a number of important factors that you should take into consideration.

One of those factors involves the content of your videos. Many people do not realize that what they write, say, or video tape literally could come back to haunt them, if not right away then in the future.  This not only involves documentation the use of illegal activities, but your thoughts, views, and beliefs.  As nice as it is to share something that you made all on your own, you need to be careful with the internet. Millions of internet users flock to online video websites just to see what they are coming across.  Although many are there just for a laugh, others are there for a specific purpose.  

If you are like many other internet users, you may be wondering how something as fun or as simple as an online video could cause you so much damage.  Honestly, there are a number of different ways.  Just one of those ways involves employment.  When applying for a job, you will have to supply your prospective employer with information about yourself.  This information should include your name, address, and telephone number.  Unlike in the past, many employers are now using the internet to research their prospective employees. What they find online may be able to help or hurt your case.  

Even though you may not be searching for a new job, it is still important to be cautious when making your own videos online.  You need to think as a prospective employer. Would you want to hire someone who has an online video of them doing illegal activities, swearing, or being downright insulting?  If you would not then chances are that no one else would as well.  In addition to worrying about prospective employers, you should also be concerned with what your current employer would think if they saw your online video.

With employment, adults are the ones who need to worry the most about their use of online video websites, such as YouTube.  However, everyone needs to be concerned, including children.  In the short term sense, you may not have to worry about the impact your homemade video would have a prospective employers, but you should be concerned with your school.  Due to the documentation of illegal activities and threats of violence, a large number of school officials are using the internet to keep tabs on their students.  This watching often involves the use of social networking sites, but online video websites as well.  

In some cases, but not all, there are little things that a school official can do, if they view one of your online videos and find it to be offensive.  Being offensive is one thing, but participating in illegal activities, as well as treating other students or teachers is another.  Not only could you be suspended from school and sports teams, but you could also be reported to your local authorities.  Even if legal action cannot be taken, it is likely that you will be closely watched for a period of time.  

Whether you are a teenager or an adult, it is important to remember that your actions may have consequences.  So, the next time that you are thinking about making a homemade video to send into one of the many online video websites, you are urged to closely examine your video’s content.  Although you may not mean to cause yourself any harm, you could do so without even realizing it.
