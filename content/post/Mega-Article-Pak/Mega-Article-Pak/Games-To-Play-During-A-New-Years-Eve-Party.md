Games to Play during a New Years Eve Party

Many hosts spend a great amount of time planning the food and cocktails for their New Years Eve party and do not give as much consideration to the type of entertainment they plan to have at their New Years Eve party. This is unfortunately because New Years Eve parties offer a great opportunity to participate in some really fun games. New Years Eve parties tend to last longer than many other parties so traditional entertainment options such as dancing may not be enough to keep the guests entertained. One fun way to spice a New Years Eve party is by playing different games. This article will offer some fun ideas games to play at a New Years Eve party.

New Years Eve is a holiday which is synonymous with alcohol consumption. The popularity of alcohol consumption is the inspiration for one idea for a game to play on New Years Eve. You can play a game by giving each person a word which is likely to come up in casual conversation and writing that word on a nametag for each person to wear during the evening. Guests are required to carry a shot of a vodka at all times and if another guests catches them saying the word on their nametag they have to take their shot and then pick up another shot to carry in case they are caught again. This game is fun because it encourages guests to mingle as they attempt to think up ways to get other guests to try to say their word. The game can be made more difficult by placing the name tag on each person’s back so they cannot see the word but other guests can. This means the guest not only has to try to avoid saying the word but also has to figure out what the word is. When playing this game, care should be taken to avoid the game being the cause of the guest becoming inebriated. One way to do this is to put a limit on the number of shots a person can consume. They can take the sticker off once they reach their limit and the last person with a sticker is declared the winner and may be awarded a surprise.

Games which involve dancing are also very popular on New Years Eve. One game which is a lot of fun is similar to a game played by children. It involves periodically stopping the music while guests are dancing. Each time the music stops, the guests are supposed to freeze in one position. One person is designated as the judge and each time the music stops, the judge eliminates the last guest to freeze his position. The last guest remaining is declared the winner of the game.

A casino night is also very popular for a New Years Eve Party. The host can set up various tables for different games such as blackjack, Texas hold’em, keno and other popular card games. The host may also enlist guests to act as dealers at each of these tables. The hosts can either be dedicated for entire night or can rotate every couple of hours so all the guests have a chance to be both a player and a dealer. Giving each of the guests a set amount of poker chips can make the games even more fun, if you inform the guests they will be able to exchange their chips at the end of the evening for raffle tickets for a few prizes. This will encourage the guests to participate in the game and really try their best to win at the games. 

The games listed above are rather original but depending on the size of the party, guests can also play standard board games. Trivial pursuit, monopoly and scrabble are popular options. These games can be played either as individuals or as teams. Additionally, they can be played once or in a tournament style. Games such as scrabble can even played with a holiday theme where guests are encouraged to use words which relate to New Years Eve.
