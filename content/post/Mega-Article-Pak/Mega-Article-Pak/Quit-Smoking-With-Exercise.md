Quit Smoking With Exercise

When you decide to stop smoking, you'll bring on
other changes in your life as well.  Smoking is a
very addictive habit, meaning that it is very hard 
to quit.  There are a lot of changes that take place,
although exercise can be a big help to you when you
decide to quit.

Try to set a new routine, such as working out or
going to the gym.  If that isn't possible, you 
should try waking up earlier and going for a short
walk.  If you can turn that walk into a run or a 
jog, it is going to be very stimulating and the best
way that you can start your day.

Keep in mind that exercise doesn't really mean 
pumping metal.  If you don't have the time to stop
by the gym every day, then it isn't really that big
of a problem, as you can always choose to workout
at home.

Whether you choose to workout at home or at a gym,
you should always remember that regularity is the
key.  It isn't getting started that's the difficult
part, it's sticking to a regular exercise program
that is difficult and proves to be stumbling block
for most people.

Some people have a great start.  They will buy 
track suits, gym wear, running shoes, and a lot
of other gear, so their first day at the gym is
almost like a celebration.  As the days go by, 
they find it very difficult to meet the demands
and their routine will slow down a lot and finally
come to a complete exercise burnout.

One mistake that several people make is choosing
the evenings to exercise.  If evenings fit your
lifestyle, then it's fine.  For most people however,
the evening hours are when they are completely
pooped.  By the evening most of us are drained,
and simply too tired for exercise.  Therefore, it
is always best to set some time aside for exercise
in the morning.

In the morning, wake up a half an hour or so 
earlier, put on your shoes, and hit the road.  Most
roads are less crowded in the morning and less
polluted as well, making it a wonderful and relaxing
way to start the day.

You should also steer clear from the coffee and try
tea instead.  If you are moving around in the house,
try playing music.  You can also redecorate your
room by adding a few pictures around.  When you
redecorate, you should get rid of everything 
that reminds you of smoking.

Plan your day where you'll have something fun to 
do at the end of the day.  It doesn't need to be
something that involves money, as you don't want 
to end up bankrupt.  Spending time with family,
playing games, or going for a walk with your
family are all good activities.

Watching television doesn't really fit into the
list.  The reason is because television isn't 
something that demands a lot of attention.  You
can easily do something else while you are
watching television.  

You should also make a list of things that build
up your stress and try to avoid them.  If it
isn't possible, you should try to find out some
some ways to bust stress and use them.  Whatever 
you do, you shouldn't use stress as an excuse
to start smoking.

There are many other methods that you can use to
beat stress.  You can try breathing exercises,
mediation, or even music.  Another great way to
beat stress is using the distressing ball.  If
you don't have one or access to one, you can
always wiggle your fingers and toes.  This too
is a great and natural method to beat stress.
