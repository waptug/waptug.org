Art Auctions for Vintage Posters

Vintage posters are always available at art auctions.  I have found all kinds of vintage poster art auctions lately.  I really liked a vintage poster I found that was from the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam.  The poster is rare because it is one of the only 500 of the 10,000 printed that is in French.

Another vintage poster I found in an art auction was from 1917.  It depicts French woman in war time performing various tasks.  The poster celebrates the contribution of French women in the workforce.  During war time, French women made up forty percent of the workforce.

I’m always a sucker for old vintage posters of rock bands.  I look for them in art auctions all the time.  I like ones that are autographed, like the one from The Who that I saw recently.  I felt like the starting bid was a little high and so I didn’t try to win it.

I have been leaning more and more lately toward French vintage posters.  I found a vintage poster for Orangina that was printed in 1970 at an art auction recently.  I thought that the art auction would only get to one thousand dollars, but I was wrong.  The vintage poster sold for twelve hundred dollars.

My older brother needed something interesting for the walls of his new apartment.  I started looking for vintage posters in art auctions and found the perfect poster.  The one that I found featured race cars and he loves race cars.  The poster was from the 1965 Nurbergring Grosser Preis Von Deutschland and looked fantastic for being forty years old.

French advertisements seem to make the best vintage posters.  I like finding art auctions for posters advertising products like Lu Biscuits.  I found a great vintage poster for less than a thousand dollars and it looks great in my kitchen.

Vintage posters that relate to travel always get a lot of interest at an art auction.  I saw a lovely poster that was advertising the English Lake District in France.  The poster was produced in 1905.  I like viewing them, but I do not personally collect posters in this style.

I found a vintage poster at an art auction that advertised shoe polish.  This was a French poster that was made in the 1930’s.  I framed it and put it in my dressing room.  It fits in there perfectly and really adds to the feel of the room.

My sister married a man with a cycling shop.  They have used a variety of cycling related items to decorate their home.  My favorite piece is an old fashioned tricycle they keep in the formal living room.  I found a vintage poster in an art auction that depicted an advertisement for Celtic Cycles and they loved it when I gave it to them.

I found set of vintage posters of The Beatles that were made in 1967.  The posters were for sale an art auction I attended.  I have seen vintage posters designed by Richard Avedon before and I really liked his vision of The Beatles.  These vintage posters were well worth the two hundred dollars each I paid for them.

The vintage poster that I have my eye on right now is up for sale at an art auction coming up.  It is an Andy Warhol advertisement for Chanel perfume.  I want to win this vintage poster and frame it and hang it on the wall of my master bathroom.  It would be perfect there and would absolutely complete the look I was going for.
