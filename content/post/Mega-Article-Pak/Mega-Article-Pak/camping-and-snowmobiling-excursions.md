Camping and Snowmobiling Excursions

Adventurous snowmobilers often add an extra measure of excitement to their snowmobiling vacations – camping. Sleeping outdoors over night for a few consecutive nights is not an easy feat to accomplish without experiencing frostbite or hypothermia or, at the very least, extreme discomfort. It is cold enough to endure the frigid temperatures that go along with snowmobiling during the daytime hours, but the evening hours provide another level of frigidity and cold weather without the warmth of the sun to balance out the cold. There are some precautions and measures that adventurous lovers of the outdoors can take to protect themselves during winter camping to fully enjoy their experience, though.

Camping in the winter wilderness can be an exciting and adrenaline-producing experience. Planning is the most important aspect of enjoying a winter camping adventure, though. Doing research about the areas you plan to visit and the winter seasonal conditions in those regions should be foremost in your planning so you can bring the appropriate equipment to stay safe. Knowing the average amount of snow, routes that you plan to take, and the experience of the group that you are going to travel with are important factors in planning your winter camping trip. For instance, planning a snowmobile vacation that involves camping overnight with young children would not be an ideal scenario as they are generally more susceptible to exposure from the frigid winter elements.

Overnight camping, especially during the winter seasons, can cause your body to lose heat at exponential rates. This can be a great danger if the proper precautions are not taken care of during the planning stages. Thermal clothes are an essential during any winter activity like snowmobiling and they are even more vital if you are going to sleep outdoors overnight. It is also important to use the layering method. The idea behind this method is to wear several loose layers of clothing, each layer providing more insulation for the body. Layering also makes it easier to remove clothing if the body begins to overheat. A body that is sweating will likely dehydrate and lose heat much quicker than a body that is dry, which is why it is important to find a comfortable amount of layers in order to balance the amount of heat needed to keep the body at an acceptable temperature. Winter clothing is not meant to warm the body, but rather to keep the natural heat of the body from escaping. 

Campers will also want to take along extra gear to make their winter camping excursion an enjoyable experience. A sleeping bag is vital, of course. But choosing the right sleeping bag is just as vital. The sleeping bag that you choose to take with you should be rated to lower temperatures that the temperatures you will experience in the area. This will help ensure that you will stay warm throughout the night. Also, take a foam pad to place between the sleeping bag and the snow-covered ground to help you further avoid the risk of hypothermia and frostbite. For cooking and warmth, you will also want to pack a gas-powered stove (along with the proper fuel, of course) rather than trying to build a fire. Firewood can be difficult to find and burn in snow-covered regions. 
Finally, no overnight camping trip would be complete without an ample amount of food for everybody in the group. A popular treat among campers is s’mores, but campers should also include foods that provide a better degree of nourishment. Since appetites lessen during cold weather, the food you take with you should be appealing so you are sure to get enough nutrition to keep you moving throughout the day. Food should ideally be dried rather than fresh fruits and vegetables. These weigh too much and contain water, which can get frozen during your trip. Dried and baked goods that are rich in vitamins and minerals, such as oatmeal, granola, and cheese are ideal components for a winter camper’s diet.

A snowmobile and camping trip can be a fun and exciting excursion for adults to enjoy as groups or as couples. With some careful planning and packing, it can be an enjoyable and enlightening experience that can be enjoyed as often as possible. It is important to realize the dangers associated with poor planning so the adventure does not turn out to be a negative or even fatal outing.
