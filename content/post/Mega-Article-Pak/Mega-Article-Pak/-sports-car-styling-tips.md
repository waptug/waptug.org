Sports Car Styling Tips


Are you planning to improve the aesthetic appearance of your car? Want to get that sporty and sleek look? Then here are some pointers that will help you dress up your car.


What products to choose from

When deciding what kind of setup you will do to your car, you should first keep in mind that there are a multitude of products being sold out there which claim superior performance and economical. But the reality is there are some good ones and and many of bad ones. Be picky when looking for car accessories and remember it is not a bad idea to look at the established brands before considering untested brands.

The wheels

One of the initial things that a car enthusiast does when dressing up a car is to replace the existing wheels with custom made ones. But this is not just for looks since performance wheels and tires also enhance a car's handling and performance. Choosing between tall wheels and short ones will be the next step. Bigger wheels get noticed more and increase the look of a car dramatically. Smaller wheels on the other hand have that vintage or retro look.

Stickers Galore

Applying sticker designs on the car hood or the other parts of the car body is one of the cheapest ways to alter and customize your car. Sticker designs range from popular performance parts logos of manufacturers as well as those designed for rally and indy races. If you are capable of making your own stickers, it is important to get permission for copying a design as it may be copyrighted. If you are planning to put stickers on the hood, choose the kind that will not be damaged by the heat of the engine. Metallic foil stickers are ideal for use on car hoods.

Lowering kits

Lowering your car means making your car more stable in turns aside from giving it an aggressive and sporty look. Cars are not the only ones that have lowering kits, so if you have a pickup truck, chances are, there is a lowering kit made for your vehicle. Although having a lower ride means improved handling, the trade off is poor ride quality since the car springs are stiffer and shorter.


These are some of the things that you can do to improve the look and stance of your car. Your car is a represents you so naturally you want it to look appealing. Of course, having a good looking car also means spending thousands of dollars. If this is your passion, then paying extra will not be a problem with you.
