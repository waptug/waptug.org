Meeting People on MySpace

The process of meeting people on MySpace is extremely easy. MySpace is an online community which encourages individuals from all over the world to become involved and create an online profile. Members are able to create a MySpace website which they can use to provide others with information about them. Members are also encouraged to view the websites belonging to other members to learn more about other members of the community. 

Those who participate in MySpace can provide as much or as little personal information as they wish and are not required to give any specific information when they design their website. Those who are willing to open up more, however, are likely to be more interesting to other members and may accumulate friends very quickly on MySpace. 

Searching for Friends on MySpace

The search feature can help new MySpace members to find friends in the community. The search feature allows users to enter in a particular word and provides search results which include MySpace members’ websites which use this word. This is an interesting way to meet potential friends on MySpace because you can enter keywords which are associated to a favorite hobby, band, book or other interest to find others who share this interest. 

Those on MySpace can use the search feature to find new friends but can also use the search feature to meet find friends with whom you have lost touch over the years. Members can also search through MySpace for users with a particular name although this not always effective because users are not required to post their full name on their MySpace website. However, there are many who do include their full name so trying this search feature is worthwhile if you are looking to locate someone from your past on MySpace. 

Using Caution on MySpace

With any online community, caution should be used when cultivating friendships on MySpace. The vast majority of those who use MySpace are simply looking to either make new friends or find long last friends but there are a small percentage of users who may have malicious intents. MySpace created their terms of services and makes an honest attempt to enforce these terms but this can be a difficult task on the Internet

It is important to remember that the Internet allows a certain degree of anonymity that can allow some unscrupulous individuals to mask their true identity and convince other MySpace members they are someone who they are really not. Common scenarios which may occur on the Internet include individuals obtaining enough information to steal the identity of another or individuals obtaining information such as an address which enables them to do physical harm to another member of MySpace. Those who use MySpace should be careful to ensure their private information is kept private while they are online. Information which can be used to harm them may include any combination of the following:

* Full name
* Place of birth
* Names of children and information on when and where they were born
* High school and year of graduation
* Social security number
* Credit card numbers
* Bank account numbers

Some of the information above may seem harmless but it is important to remember devious criminals can use public resources such as newspapers and library books to find out more information about an individual. 

When you are Being Harassed on MySpace

Harassment is a serious issue which the MySpace administrators take very seriously. However, the most effective method they recommend for getting those harassing you to stop is to ignore them. According to the FAQ page on MySpace 99.9% of harassment situations diffuse if harassing emails are completely ignored. You can also block users which prevents them from contacting you through MySpace and remove them from your friends list which will prevent them from adding comments. If another user has created a profile about you with malicious intent you can contact MySpace customer service and provide them with a link to the profile and they will investigate the profile and delete it if warranted.
