As a bow hunter, you know the importance of choosing the right bow. It is always a personal choice. There are a number of bows on the market. There are also plenty of accessories that go with them. When the time comes for you to pick the right bow, consider the same things that you would if you were going to purchase a pair of hunting boots. You want to find a bow that is adequately fit, durable, and easy to use. As with all other hunting equipment, nothing beats quality when choosing a bow.  
 
Due to the sheer number of bows available on the market, you should try as many bows as possible. You want to find a bow that feels good in your hands. You also want a bow that is the proper size for your body type. Finally, you want to purchase a bow that will match your shooting style. These factors will affect your level of accuracy and comfort while shooting the bow. Consider your bow an investment that will either benefit you or cause you a great deal of frustration while in the field. 
 
There are many things to consider when buying a bow. One of the most important is eye dominance. Eye dominance should play an important role as you search for the right bow. You should know your eye dominance so that you can pick a left-hand or right-hand bow. Most often, a person who is right handed will have a dominant right eye. The same applies to someone who is left handed. 
 
The most effective way to figure out which eye is your dominant eye is to point to a distant object with both eyes open. Close your left eye. If your finger is still pointing directly at the target, your right eye is dominant. If you notice that your finger is no longer pointing at the target, you are likely left-eye dominant. If your right eye is your dominant eye, buy a right-handed bow. Do the opposite if you are left-eye dominant. Taking the time to do this will benefit your accuracy with the bow. 
 
Other things to consider while shopping for a bow are draw length, draw weight, axle-to-axle length (ATA), and brace height. The most important thing, however, is to make sure that you choose a bow that has been made by a highly reputable company. Find a company that will always stand behind their product. They should also offer a high level of customer service. You will benefit by purchasing a bow that comes with a guarantee. Most companies that deal with higher-end bows will automatically offer an unlimited lifetime warranty. 
 
You need to make sure that you choose the right bow as you prepare for the bow hunting season. There are a number of options on today's market, so take the time to research all of them. Several factors will determine what kind of bow you purchase. Decide if your right or left eye is dominant, and then select your bow accordingly. This will help you as you attempt to improve your accuracy in the field. Deal only with highly reputable companies that offer customer service and that guarantee your bow. You will be able to thoroughly enjoy the hunting season once you have found the right bow.
