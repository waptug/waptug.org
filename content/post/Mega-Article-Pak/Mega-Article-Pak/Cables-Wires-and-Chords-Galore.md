Cables Wires and Chords Galore

One thing that often gets overlooked during the process of purchasing pieces, parts, and components for your surround sound system is the importance of cables to the overall sound of your system. It makes absolutely no idea to buy top of the line speakers and excellent quality components only to use substandard el cheapo cables with which to connect them to one another. Unfortunately we see this every day and it causes problem with the quality of the sound that leads over time to a total and complete dissatisfaction with the quality of sound your system provides. 

There are other considerations when it comes to cables such as aesthetics, which will also affect the price when it comes to your system. I strongly encourage you to seriously consider what level of cabling and wires you can and cannot live with before you purchase your surround sound or home theater system, as both tend to be very wire and cable intensive. There are however things you can do to tame the tangle before it overtakes your home and one of my first recommendations is to seriously consider the value that going wireless would add to your system.

Wireless speakers eliminate the need for a good portion of the wires and cabling that are typically part and parcel of the lot when it comes to good sound systems. Going wireless for me is far preferable to drilling holes into the walls and running the wires through and having a rat's next of speaker wires overhead in my home is simply not an option. Of course everyone has different priorities when it comes to their surround sound or home theater systems and some people aren't all the considered about wires and cables. If you are not one that bothers then that is no problem either.

Unfortunately the wires and cables in a home theater or surround sound system are not limited to the speakers alone and while going wireless for the speakers is often financially feasible it's an entirely different ball park to go wireless for the whole kit and caboodle. For this reason there are all kinds of nifty tips and tricks for taming a mess of wires and keeping things organized and tidy behind the scenes. Among my favorites are these new power strips that allow you to color code and label which cord goes where. These strips are also great because they offer surge protection for your costly electronic equipment. 

In addition to having the power strips labeled and organized you can purchase PVC piping and run all the cords down one tube in order to reach the power strip. You can also paint the tube in order to blend in with your wall if you are concerned about the aesthetics of the tube. I personally like this option for keeping all the chords in one spot rather than having them run haphazardly along the back of your other electronic components. It simply looks neater and more organized and your friends and family will be impressed at your cleverness for thinking of it. 

If you have a certain disdain for over organization or having things too terribly tidy you can always opt for these Velcro ties that you simple use like the old sandwich bag ties. They can keep several chords together so that you aren't constantly having to work around them and yet allows you easy access to the chords should you find a sudden need for access or get the urge to rearrange or change settings and situations. 

While it doesn't take rocket science to tame the wild tangle of chords that sometimes invade of entertainment space, it often helps to have a few tricks up your sleeve when confronting the seemingly endless stream of wires that are part of the average home theater or surround sound system. Hopefully you will find that some of these suggestions and tips will be helpful in your home.
