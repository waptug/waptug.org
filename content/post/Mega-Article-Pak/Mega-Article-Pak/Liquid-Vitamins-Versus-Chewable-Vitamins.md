Liquid Vitamins Versus Chewable Vitamins

Nearly 50% of Americans residing in the United States use some type of vitamin or vitamin supplement ever day.  Even though they may take vitamins, most are unaware of the fact that nearly 90% of the nutrients and minerals found in the vitamin isn’t properly absorbed by the body, which means they are virtually watered down and most of their benefits proven to be not effective.

Almost all individuals who take vitamins use the pill form.  Pills were once thought of to be the best, simply because they were the only vitamin sources.  These days, liquid vitamins are much more effective, and people are starting to realize it.  Although many use pills or chewable vitamins, they aren’t getting near the benefit they think they are.

Vitamins and supplements are very popular, especially for those who have active lifestyles and find it difficult to consume the necessary vitamins and minerals they need from the proper meals.  Therefore, those with busy lifestyles turn to vitamins and supplements to give their bodies what it needs to carry out day to day activities.  Even though you should never replace food with vitamins, vitamins can help you to get the nutrients and minerals you need on a daily basis.

The main reason why liquid vitamins are more effective than pills and tablets is due to the nature of their liquid base.  With the vitamins being liquid, they are easier for the body to digest and easily absorbed into the digestive tract as well.  Chewable tablets and pills will pass through the body in hard form, making them hard to digest.  Liquid is always digested when it passes through, so it will go through your body quicker and take effect faster.

Due to the body having to work less to break down and absorb liquid vitamins, they will pass through the body much faster.  The nutrients and minerals contained in liquid vitamins will reach vital areas faster through the bloodstream, and they are easier to use by the most important organs in your body that need them the most.  Liquid is also easy to swallow as well, as you can add the liquid vitamin to your favorite juice or just take it right out of the bottle if you prefer.

With pills or chewable vitamins, the majority of the nutrients and minerals that are contained in the vitamins aren’t normally broken down in the digestive system.  With these types of vitamins being in hard form, they are harder for the body to pass at the most crucial moments, where the body needs to have nutrients and minerals.  Unless you completely chew up the vitamin, it can stay in hard form until it passes through when you go to the bathroom.  If this happens, you are normally just wasting the vitamin as it doesn’t have a chance to get into the bloodstream.

Liquid vitamins have proven themselves to be the best way to get the minerals and nutrients your body needs.  As more and more people discover the benefits of liquid vitamins and how easy they are to digest, they make the switch.  Liquid is far superior to tablets and pills, simply because it tastes better, it’s easier to digest, and it travels through the body faster.  You can find many different flavors and types of vitamin supplements at your local nutrition store, or get online and order what you need there.  Either way you go - you’ll find liquid vitamins to be the ideal way to get the nutrients you need for you body on a daily basis.
