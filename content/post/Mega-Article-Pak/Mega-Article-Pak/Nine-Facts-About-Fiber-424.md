Nine Facts About Fiber

If you've been looking for a way towards a high
octane diet, you'll find fiber to be exactly what
you need.  Even though research has shown fiber to
be powerful, many people aren't taking this nutrient
seriously.

To help you fuel your health with fiber, here are 
10 facts to help.

1.  Fiber fights diseases.  A diet high in fiber can 
help to prevent colon cancer and heart disease.  High
fiber helps the body to eliminate cholesterol by 
binding it in the digestive tract.  For thousands of
years, fiber has been used to stop constipation.

2.  Fiber can actually help with overeating.  All high
fiber foods will take longer to chew and digest, 
making you feel satisfied longer

3.  Most popular foods don't have enough fiber.  If
you like the more popular foods, you probably need
to increase your intake of fiber.

4.  Grains offer the most fiber.  Dietary fiber is
actually plant matter that we cannot digest.  The best
sources are whole grains and concentrated grain
products.  

5.  Kids need fiber as well.  Children that are older
than 2 years of age should consume a daily intake of
fiber.  Kids are most receptive to fiber found in 
fruits, vegetables, and even fortified breakfast 
cereals.  

6.  More fiber needs more water.  In order to keep
fiber moving through your digestive tract, you'll 
need to consume a lot of water.  With your diet of
fiber, you'll need eight or more glasses of water 
every day.

7.  Fiber cannot be cooked out.  When you cook
your fruits and vegetables, don't worry about cooking
the fiber out, as it stays.  The fiber found in
fruits and vegetables aren't just in the skin or
in the peel.

8.  You can get enough fiber.  If you eat more than
50 grams of fiber in a day, you can get diarrhea 
and bloating, which can interfere with your body's
absorption of other key minerals.

9.  Getting the right amount of fiber in your diet
doesn't have to be hard.  Even though you may think
so, getting the amount of fiber you need isn't very
hard to do.  All you have to do is eat the right 
foods and you'll be well on your way to a fiber
rich lifestyle.

As one of the key ingredients to healthy eating, 
fiber is something you don't want to skip.  Fiber can
serve many different purposes, which were covered
above.  If you aren't getting enough fiber in your 
diet - you should do something about now instead
of waiting until it is too late.
