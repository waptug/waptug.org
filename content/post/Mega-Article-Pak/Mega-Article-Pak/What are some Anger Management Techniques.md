When a person becomes irritated and headed for a fit of anger, it is suggested they breathe deeply. This technique recommends that the person breathe from their diaphragm in order to relax.

Finding ways to handle the problem and confront it is the main objective in this anger management technique. It may take awhile to conform to this plan. It is important to stick to it, eventually the answers will come.

People with anger issues are taught through anger management techniques to practice better communication skills. Often a fit of anger arises because an individual misunderstood a conversation.

Listening rationally to what the other person has to say might make a huge difference in a reaction. 

These are just a few anger management techniques. There are many others which may be helpful to an individual requiring help. There are many books, movies and website on the Internet which can provide information regarding anger management techniques.
