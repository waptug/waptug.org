Practical Wedding Favors

A considerate bride and groom may want to think about giving out wedding favors which are practical instead of simply easy, inexpensive or suitable for the theme of the wedding. This is important because favors which are given for other reasons may not be valued by your guests. In fact they may be quickly discarded soon after your wedding and will not serve as a reminder of your wedding. However, if you make the decision to give out favors which are more practical in nature your guests are more likely to appreciate and cherish the favors which you give out on your wedding day. These favors may not be the most romantic but they are much more likely to be appreciated by your guests than more whimsical items such as figurines and potpourri. This article will offer a few tips for practical wedding favors you can give to your guests on your wedding day.

Coasters are one idea for wedding favors which can be romantic or suit the theme of your wedding but can also be very practical. You can purchase coasters in a variety of shapes including hearts to provide for your guests as wedding favors. Heart shaped coasters will be ideal because they are romantic and convey the sentiment of love but they are also something your guests can really use. Another option for using coasters as wedding favors is to give out coasters which match the theme of the wedding. For example you can purchase coasters with pictures of sand or the beach to go with a beach themed wedding. You can also give out coasters with room for the guest to insert a picture. You can include a picture of the bride and the groom in one of the coasters and leave the rest of the coasters in the set blank so your guests can use their own photos if they wish.

Key chains are another example of wedding favors which can be both romantic and practical. Hearth shaped key chains or key chains in the shape of wedding bells or other items related to love or wedding are a good idea for favors. You can select an elegant key chain which is sturdy so your guests will want to use but that is also very romantic and will remind your guests of your wedding for years to come. 

Another very practical wedding favor idea is a gift of candles. Whether you choose to give tea light candles, taper candles or candles of another style it is very likely that your guests will be able to use these favors. Most people already have at least a few candles in their house but they can always use a few more. Candles are very versatile. They can be used to set a romantic mood but can also serve other purposes as well. For example in the event of power outages, candles can be used to provide lighting. With so many uses for candles it is no surprise that if you give your wedding guests candles as a favor, they are likely to use the candles in the future as opposed to setting them aside and forgetting about them which might happen with other less practical favors. 

Wine charms in a shape such as hearts or another romantic theme are also very practical favor ideas for a wedding. Wine charms by themselves are somewhat romantic but when they are designed in shapes such as hearts, wedding bells or other romantic shapes they are very appropriate for a wedding. They are also a very practical favor idea because many people will not have this type of item but can really use a set of wine charms. Wine charms are simply small charms which can be placed on the wine glass to distinguish one glass from another. This is useful in a party situation where guests may be mingling and may set there glass down for a minute or two while chatting and then become confused about which glass is theirs. Charms which distinguish the glasses help to eliminate this problem.
