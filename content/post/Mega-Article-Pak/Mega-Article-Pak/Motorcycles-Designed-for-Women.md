Motorcycles Designed for Women

Most motorcycles are designed with men in mind, and it is true that they are the majority of the operators. However, there are many women who want to do more with a motorcycle than just ride on the back of it. Finding a motorcycle designed to fit a woman is more difficult and the choices are limited. However, it is very possible to find one if you know what to look for. More and more motorcycle manufacturers are becoming aware of this market.

For too long female motorcycle owners have been stereotyped as reckless women wearing all leather, smoking and drinking with a wild gang of bikers. Approximately 10% of motorcycle owners are women, and many more are interested in purchasing one. These women come from all walks of life. Some of them enjoy the thrill of riding their own bike while others find it a very economical way of commuting each day. The majority of women who do own motorcycles are in their 30’s, they have a family, and they are educated. 

More than 80% of the motorcycles women purchase are cruiser models. Sports motorcycles are also very popular. Women prefer a motorcycle that is lighter weight, but they still want the power males crave with many motorcycle models. Today, many of the major motorcycle manufacturers are providing women with options for motorcycles that are light weight yet fast. These manufacturers include Harley Davidson, Suzuki, Honda, Kawasaki, and Yamaha. 

Harley Davidson offers three models designed specifically for women – the Sportster, DynaGlider Low-Rider, and the XL 1200 Custom. Kawasaki offers women dirt bikes including the Ninja 500R and the ZZR600. Honda has followed suit with the Nighthawk 250CC and the Rebel 250CC. Suzuki offers the 650 Savage, Marauder 800CC, and the 800 Intruder. 

If you are considering purchasing a motorcycle designed specifically for a woman, then these models give you plenty to choose from. Make sure you take your time and find the one that fits your body correctly. Sit on the motorcycle and make sure your feet are able to touch the ground on both sides. Make sure it is light enough that you can handle it. If you are struggling with it, then pass it over as you will have difficult controlling it on the road. Look for a motorcycle with a low, narrow seat. You also want long handle bars so that you can ride the motorcycle comfortably. If you plan to ride your motorcycle a great deal, you may consider having one custom built to fit your style and body. 

Keep in mind that motorcycles for women are available in models that are recommended for a new rider and some that are for a more experienced operator. Make sure you take this into consideration while you are contemplating the motorcycle to purchase. 

There are many online motorcycle clubs for women and magazines as well. Most of them are operated by other female motorcycle owners. This is a great place to ask questions and get valuable information as you look for one of your own. Online websites for female motorcycle owners are a great place to meet other women and to find out about various events and motorcycle rallies. You can even help set up a motorcycle event in your area. Fit out how other female motorcycle owners enjoy their bike. This is also a great place to find out reviews on various models and even to find used bikes for sale. 

The stereotype of a “biker chick” is still in the minds of many people, but you would be surprised how many women have passed you on their motorcycle. It is often hard to tell if they are wearing a helmet. As the number of female motorcycle owners continues to grow, you can be sure there will be more models to select from. Manufacturers aren’t going to pass up this target population. The American Motorcyclist Association now has 265,000 registered female motorcycle owners, proving this to be more than a passing fad.
