Evolving Technology and Auto Sound Systems

Finding auto sound systems that can keep up with the constantly evolving technology of today is a real challenge for many car and sound enthusiasts not only around the nation but also around the world. There was a time in the not so distant past when car stereos that had CD players or CD disc changers where the cutting edge of technology. New technology however has nearly rendered the CD players in cars as obsolete as long forgotten 8-track players. The sad news is that many carmakers are clinging to the old days and only offer something as modern as cassette players as standard equipment for auto sound systems.

I think those days will soon be forgotten, as cassettes are no longer even in mainstream production. You should also find that as CDs are rapidly becoming replaced by MP3s that take up very little space in our cars and homes, one day very soon we may see that music companies have decided it is no longer cost effective to produce CDs and render all music to digital formats. So, what does this mean for auto sound systems? It's actually good news for savvy manufacturers are well as savvy consumers who have their eyes on the future and the growing role technology is playing in our lives and as well as our commute to work.

We've seen a recent introduction of satellite radio to our selection of auto sound systems. These stations offer the allure of no commercial interruptions to your music play in exchange for the price of a monthly subscription. At the moment there are two major companies that offer this service to consumers and each have rather proprietary equipment for their use and installation into your car. They are actually offering some rather tempting offers in order to encourage subscribers. Among those wonderful offers are auto sound systems for your vehicle at less than $100 with a prepaid year of subscription services. 

For the satellite radio companies this indicates a constantly growing pool of prospective subscribers and the cost of the equipment is a drop in the bucket when compared to customer loyalty and being on the cutting edge of sound technology. The drawback is that you must decide which service you wish to go with before making the purchase. Also while they offer a very nice auto sound system (bare bones kind of kit that only allows for the radio reception in most cases) at a very sweet price, if you want upgrades such as MP3 compatibility, CD players, CD changers, DVD players, GPS, or any number of other new and advanced technology you will still have to purchase those for your sound system at an upgraded price. There are a few packages that come with these things, but the price is a little on the hefty side. Oh the sacrifices we will make for a more enjoyable daily commute.

Know what your expectations are before you decide to purchase the auto sound system of your dream or you could find that it is more the stuff that nightmares are made of than sweet dreams. Do not live in constant fear that if you buy today you will find something you like better 6 months from now, that is a reality. Technology is growing and evolving at a frightening pace. Find the auto sound system that you like best today and make that your purchase. This is a much better option than waiting around indefinitely and purchasing one just as your warranty expires on your car and it's time for a trade in and another auto sound system.
