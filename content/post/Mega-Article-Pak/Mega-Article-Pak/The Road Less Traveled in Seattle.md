The Roads Less Traveled in Seattle

If you are in the process of making plans to visit Seattle Washington, I'm sure you've checked out all kinds of information about what there is to do and see in the area. There are many things that make all of the must do lists because they offer appeal to the greater population rather than things that would appeal to specific segments of population. 

I consider myself young, hip, and fun loving. While there are many things on the mass lists that I find appealing, I really like going off the beaten path just a little bit and finding things to do and places to see that aren't going to be overcrowded, overpopulated, and simply overdone. I like to find something that not every other tourist in the city is going to be standing in line in front of me to do. Here are a few of the nifty tours and other things I have found to do in Seattle. 

The first one on my list is the Private Eye on Seattle Murder and Mystery Tour. There are three tours offered, the Queen Anne Murder and Mystery Tour, the Capital Hill Tour (which each cost $25 per person and lasts about two and a half hours), and Haunted Happenings, which is also known as the Seattle Ghost Tour (this tour lasts about 3 hours and is also $25 per person). These are great for any fan of true crime or simply dusty old detective novels. They are not however, tours I would recommend for the squeamish or faint of heart. I recommend any one of these tours or all of them if possible. They are a great way to spend your time while in Seattle. 

After a trip with Private Eye on Seattle, you simply must check out the Seattle Museum of the Mysteries, which is a museum dedicated to the study of paranormal sciences. This is the only museum of its kind in Washington State. If you have any interest in Big Foot, UFOs, crop circles, ghosts, or just enjoy legends, lore, and tall tales, then this museum should be right up your alley. Even if these things aren't vitally important in your day-to-day existence, it is still really interesting to see the artifacts that have been collected and to hear the stories that are being told. 

Coming back to the world of the living, one of my favorite places in Seattle is a little bit crowded with tourists; however, it is well worth dealing with a few more people if you ask me. That place would be Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame. I'm not sure if my fascination with this place stems from my love of science fiction movies and literature or simply from the contribution that science fiction has made on society in the last few decades. Perhaps it is a slight combination of the two. Or maybe it is just the coolness factor alone. For whatever reason, this museum is a favorite of mine and I hope that you will feel the same way about it after you visit.

If you are visiting the Science Fiction Museum, you might seriously consider purchasing a combination ticket for the Experience Music Project. Separately the project is a tad expensive but when you purchase a combo ticket for both you save enough money to take the sting out of the visit. If you are a music lover, particularly rock and roll, then this experience is one well worth having. The price is somewhat prohibitive if you are visiting on a budget but if you plan carefully you can manage savings in other areas that will make up for the cost. 

There are so many fascinating things to do, see, and experience in Seattle and the surrounding areas. I hope that I have introduced you to a few things that are a little off the beaten path and yet offer something of interest to you at the same time. The most important thing to remember when visiting Seattle, Washington is that vacations are fun and that is what you should have-lots of fun.
