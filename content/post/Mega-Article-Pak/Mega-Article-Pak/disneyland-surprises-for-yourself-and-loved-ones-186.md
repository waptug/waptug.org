Disneyland Surprises For Yourself and Loved Ones

If you would like to surprise someone who will be 
traveling with you to Disneyland, you can easily do
this by using the Disneyland Vacation Planning 
Service. This service has many different services that 
can be performed for you, but one of the best ones is
the Surprise service. 

Simply contact the Vacation Planning department, 
and tell them who the surprises will be for, which 
Resort hotel you will be staying at and what your 
budget is for the surprises. You will also need to tell 
them when you would like the surprise deliveries to 
be made, and what type of gifts you are interested in. 
They will also want to know who the favorite Disney 
character is of the person that you want to surprise.

After providing all of this information, your credit card 
information will be required. You can be sure that the 
amount charged to your credit card will not exceed 
your surprise budget that you have set. This is a great 
way to add more value to your Disney experience, and 
to constantly experience great anticipation of the next 
surprise to come!
