Home Decorating With Southwestern Flair

There is something to be said about a southwestern styled home decorating plan. It is undeniably beautiful and in incredibly elegant when done with an eye for the real beauty of this style of architecture and design. More importantly, in the right home, this style of décor can be nothing short of fun. From geckos to cowboys, and cacti to anything in between there are plenty of options from which to choose when it comes to southwestern design. 

The southwestern design and décor style is more than one thing. It is more like a lifestyle-much like the Creole home decorating style. There are many things that make the southwest such a wonderful place to live and visit. It makes perfect sense that many would want to bring these things into their homes in order to experience them day after day, even when the southwest seems so very far away. In fact, even those who have never seen or experienced the southwestern states of the US for themselves have found the style of architecture and décor to be enchanting enough to want to incorporate it into their homes.

For those who are unfamiliar with home decorating in a southwestern style this is a style that makes copious use of the elements when decorating. Metal, clay, water, plants, and animals are essential to this style of décor. Colors are also important to this style of décor. The colors required to pull this look off are going to be decidedly sun baked and not bright and bold as other design styles call for. Pottery is also a very important design style of this type of décor. Have fun and be imaginative. Incorporate wall art into the room, some properly colorful throw rugs, and some clever baskets and pottery for storage and effect and before you know it you will have a beautiful room in the grand southwestern style.

Don't make it too neat but at the same time do not allow clutter to get a grip either. Decorate with living in mind and create a room that provides a few hiding places for those stray items when company pops in unexpectedly while you are at it. Pottery and baskets provide the perfect opportunity for this. Just make sure that you do put the items where they belong afterwards or you are going to find your pottery overflowing. 

One thing to keep in mind about the southwest is that it holds its ties to the old west rather closely. This means that you are quite likely to find a cowboy or two sitting right next to an old Indian or riding on the back of coyote. There are no hard and fast rules in the old west or the modern southwest other than he who has the quickest draw makes the rules. Enjoy the process of decorating in this grand style and you will have won half the battle. More importantly however, do not over think it. If it looks too contrived the look will simply fall flat. Pile blankets and rugs in the corner on top of the baskets in order to create height as well as easy access to those items when the temperatures suddenly dive at night-this is the desert right? Or at least that's the atmosphere you are going for. If you are really adventurous hang a lasso over the door somewhere for real southwestern effect.
