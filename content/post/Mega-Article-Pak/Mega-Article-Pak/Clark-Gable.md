Clark Gable: A Short Bio

William Clark Gable who is popularly known as Clark Gable was born on February 1, 1901 in a small town called Cadiz in Ohio. Clark Gable was also known by nicknames such "Gabe" and "The King". Clark Gable had five marriages. The first two ended in divorce with Josephine Dillon and Ria Langham respectively. The third marriage took place with Carole Lombard but that too was short lived as she died after three years of marriage. Clark Gable married Sylvia Ashley nearly 7 years after the death of his third wife. But that too ended within 3 years of marriage. His last wife survived Clark Gable when he died of a heart attack on November 16, 1960.

Clark Gable's had a miserly childhood. He was only seven months old when his mother passed away. He quit his school at the age of 16 and began working in a tire factory in Akron, Ohio. Still his tough days were not over. He worked in stock companies, oil fields and sold ties. It was after watching the play The Bird of Paradise that he wanted to be an actor. In the year 1924 Clark Gable was able to reach Hollywood somehow with the help of Josephine Dillon who was a theater manager of Portland, Oregon who also coached him on acting. Josephine Dillon who later on became his first wife who was twelve years senior to him played an important role in helping Clerk Gable enter Hollywood.

Lionel Barrymore the famous actor and the director recommended Gable to MGM's Irving Thalberg that he be screen tested. After the screening Irving Thalberg was not impressed particularly with his looks. But the studio eventually hired him after several screen tests in 1930. He worked as a co-actor with Joan Crawford in 1931 film Dance, Fools, Dance. Public liked his on screen chemistry with Jean Harlow in Red Dust in 1932 which took to top of the popularity chart. There was a spat between Gable and MGM as refused to do assignment for which he was heavily punished by loaning him out to low rent paying Columbia Pictures. Again his destiny wanted him to be a star, working with Columbia Pictures in Frank Capra's "It happened One Night" Gabel won an Oscar which was one of the best romantic comedies to be ever produced. 

He was called back by MGM with far more intense roles in movies like "Mutiny on the Bounty" in 1935 and "Gone with the Wind" in 1939 for which he was nominated to Oscar for best actor role. Gable left Hollywood for three years after his third wife Carole Lombard died in a plane crash along with her mother. He joined Army Corps and served Europe during World War II. He starred in "Adventure" in 1945, which was highly promoted, as his comeback movie. But the film had a lukewarm response. MGM thought that Gable's salary is too high and thus did not renew his contract with the studio. He starred in many unnoticeable films there on during 1940's and 1950's. During the filing of his last movie "Misfits" in 1961 he announced that he is going to become a father. But to his misfortune he passed away without seeing his son. Clark Gable was laid to rest in the shrine he built for his third wife Carole Lambord and her mother in their memory. He may be gone but to us he remains a legend even to this day and forever.
