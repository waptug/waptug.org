Fall for Home Decorating

Autumn is the time of year in which you can literally smell the changes. Leaves are burning, peanuts are roasting, and most people are just beginning to fill a hint of a chill in the air. More than smelling the changes that are coming you can see them. Leaves begin to take on brilliant hues and the colors are spectacular to watch and witness. This is the time of year that thoughts begin to turn to football, hiking, and the upcoming holidays (for there are quite a few on the horizon). 

Fall contains two primary holidays for many people. Those include Halloween and Thanksgiving. Keep these holidays in mind when planning your primary fall home decorating scheme and make small adjustments in order to accommodate the holidays. Personally, I love the colors associated with autumn. The yellows, shades of gold, orange, and brown are favorites for my decorating taste. I always regret a little that this time of year is often overshadowed by Christmas as it approaches and the expectations of others that I decorate for Christmas almost immediately after celebrating Thanksgiving.

For those who lack inspiration when it comes to home decorating for fall, keep the colors mentioned above in mind. One great theme to incorporate into the decorating process would be the theme of leaves. Leaves falling from the trees are one of the most common associations with this time of year and it is a great look to incorporate into your home. You can even find leaf garlands in fall shades if you are inclined to look for them. Leaves can also be incorporated into lovely centerpieces and floral arrangements to hallmark the season.

Harvest is another common association with autumn. This is also rather easy to incorporate into most home decorating designs. Gourds make an excellent accent piece for this time of year and you can find real ones in almost any vegetable market along with many realistic imitation gourds. These can be used, much like or along with leaves, as part of centerpieces, in floral arrangements, in tabletop decorations, and even to hold place cards for large gatherings. They are incredibly versatile as well as colorful and make a great addition to any autumn home decorating venture. 

Pumpkins are essentially gourds but they have a special place all their own in the fall home decorating scheme. Pumpkins have a special association with both Halloween and Thanksgiving (pumpkin pie anyone) and should not be overlooked as an important tool for decoration. In addition they are just bright, colorful, and cheerful to have around the house. To avoid the stench of rotting pumpkins simply avoid carving them if you intend to keep them around for a little while. Those that are carved should be placed outside and only carved within days of the 'big day'. 

A great centerpiece idea in general for fall would include a large bowl, in outstanding fall colors such as a burnt orange or a shade of gold. For the first part of autumn you can fill the centerpiece with candies that are wrapped in fall colors. This is ideal for family munchies as well as trick or treaters that may find their way to your door on Halloween. Once this holiday has ended you can fill the bowl with colorful leaves and gourds to complete the look. This should carry you through Thanksgiving when it is time to begin thinking about Christmas decorations and wintertime rather than fall. 

Whether you adore fall like I do or dread its appearance each year for whatever reason there is little denying that fall is ripe with decorating ideas and ideals. Take the time to look around your local craft stores and see where inspiration strikes. It is never too early or too late in the year to begin thinking about what you are going to do for your home decorating plan in the seasons to come.
