Vegas Basics

If you're planning a trip to Vegas in the near future there are a few basic things you should know. First things first, walking shoes are a must for any trip to Vegas. You will probably be spending a lot of time on your feet and will need shoes that can handle standing in lines and walking quite nicely.

Second, the weather in Vegas is fairly predictable. You are likely to experience rather cool nights, particularly during the months between October and April so bring some warm clothes. You should also be prepared for a lot of sunshine and pack copious amounts of sunscreen in order to protect your skin. 

Remember that the times around holidays are often the busiest times in Vegas if you want to avoid the higher prices and larger crowds you should avoid booking during these times. And if those are the times you absolutely wish to stay and play in Vegas you should make plans and book well ahead of time to make sure you have your first choice in accommodations.

It is important to remember that Vegas is indeed a desert town and that you will need to drink plenty of water and moisturize more than you might be accustomed to. This is a much drier climate than many people experience in their day-to-day lives and the heat and dryness can sneak up on you for a double whammy if you aren't prepared.

If you're a golfer, you've found heaven and should come prepared. This means you should bring your best clubs along with you and be prepared to play a few rounds. You should probably also bring a nice set of dress clothes in order to catch some of the great shows that are always playing in Vegas.

While Vegas is famous for big spenders, it is quite possible to spend thriftily and have a nice vacation for two at around $100 per day. At the other end of the spectrum, big spenders can drop thousands on one meal very easily. Pay attention to the places you are considering before you enter if you are on a limited budget.

If you're planning to stray far from your hotel or resort, it's a good idea if you plan to rent a car or drive your own. The distances here can be quite conceiving and you can easily loose track of time while enjoying yourself inside the many casinos. 

Vegas is almost as famous for weddings as it is for Casinos. If you are hoping to get married Vegas style you have a lot of styles from which to choose and you are not by any means alone. More than 122,000 couples apply for marriage licenses in Vegas each year. The licensing fees for marriage in Vegas is around $55 (this is the current rate, keep in mind that this rate is subject to change) and then there are the fees involved for the chapel you use, the services offered, etc. You can choose to go as informal and small or as bold and lavish as you can afford. 

One of the most important things to remember about Vegas is like the new commercials claim, "What happens in Vegas, Stays in Vegas". So let your hair down and have some fun during your time here and be sure to make plans for your return trip.

This can be a wonderful vacation experience for you whether you are planning marriage, a golf smorgasbord, a gambling festival, to see your favorite act, or just to spend time with the family hanging out around the pool. Your trip to Vegas is what you make of your trip to Vegas. I suggest you have as much fun as possible. Enjoy the sights, watch the shows, enjoy the many great buffets, and spend some time at the hotel spa relaxing and rejuvenating as you prepare to go back home and face the outside world yet again.
