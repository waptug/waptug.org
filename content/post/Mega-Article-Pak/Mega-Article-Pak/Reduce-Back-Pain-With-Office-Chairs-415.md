Reduce Back Pain With Office Chairs

When you sit in an office chair for a long period
of time, you run the risk of causing low back pain
or even causing more damage to an already existing
back or neck problem. The reason for this is because
sitting in a static position will increase pain
in the neck, back, shoulders, arms, and even more
so, add pressure to the back and spinal discs.

When you sit in an office chair for a long period of
time, most people tend to slouch over or down in the
chair, stretching the spinal ligaments and straining
the discs in the spinal column.  Sitting in these
positions over time can further damage the spinal 
structures and cause you major problems in your lower
back.  

If you sit at your desk for long periods of time, an
ergonomic chair is something you must have.  These
chairs can help you maximize support for your back 
and help you maintain the proper posture while you 
sit in the chair.  Simply owning the chair is not 
enough, as its crucial to adjust the chair to the
proportions of your individual body structure.

No matter how comfortable you may be in your office
chair, prolonged static posture isn't good for your
back and also happens to be a contributo to muscle
strain and back problems.  Every half hour, you 
should get out of your chair to walk, stand, or
even stretch for a few minutes.  Even walking to 
the bathroom or to get something to drink is great
for your body.

Walking for several minutes will help you even more,
as it gets your blood circulating.  Although many 
office chairs are designed to reduce back pain, 
moving around throughout the day when you can is 
always the best thing you can do for your back.

Even though many people have standard office chairs,
there are many different other styles available for
you to purchase.  Traditional or standard office 
chairs may be great for the money, although they 
won't help you that much when it comes to preventing
back pain.  

The more expensive chairs or those with ergonomic 
benefits are your best purchase.  They will help your
body while you sit at your desk, even help those 
with current back problems.  If you have to sit at
your desk for long periods of time, make sure you 
choose your office chair wisely.  You'll be sitting
in your chair while you work, therefore you want it
to be both comfortable and safe.
