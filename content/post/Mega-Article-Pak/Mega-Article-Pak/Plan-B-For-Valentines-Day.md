Plan B for Valentines Day

Each year men and women spend a great deal of time and energy planning Valentine’s Day surprises for their loved ones. However, unfortunately, each year a lot of these plans are often ruined each year due to circumstances beyond their control. They may find that all of their advance planning seems to go to waste but in most cases Valentine’s Day may still turn out to be a great day just because they are getting to spend the day together. However, this article will provide some information on how you can not only plan a great Valentine’s Day surprise for your loved one but also plan a backup plan in case anything goes wrong. 

One example of a Valentine’s Day surprise which can be ruined by circumstances beyond your control is a simple picnic in the park. It is a very simple and romantic idea but it is also one which is dependent on the weather. Rain, snow, or incredibly cold weather can put a damper on your Valentine’s Day plan to have a romantic picnic in the park. The simple solution to dealing with inclement weather is to move your picnic indoors if the weather becomes foul. This can be very easy to do and requires very little advance planning. The easiest way to do this is to use your own house or apartment as the backup location. The only advance planning involved is straightening up your place beforehand to create a relaxing environment. Also if you have a roommate you might want to make sure he is out for the evening so you and your date can be alone. You can even make the indoor picnic more relaxing by purchasing CDs with nature sounds or soft music.

Planning to take your date to a nice restaurant on Valentine’s Day can backfire. Even if you make reservations well in advance there can still be complications. For example the restaurant may lose your reservations, be too busy to honor your reservation or the restaurant may be too crowded to have a relaxing experience. In these cases you might want to consider not having dinner in the restaurant because it will be too complicated and not at all relaxing. If you are concerned one of these situations will occur you can have a plan B by being prepared to go home and cook your date a fabulous meal if the restaurant is too hectic on Valentine’s Day. You can prepare by buying a few simple and versatile ingredients that you can use to create a great meal at a moments notice. This way you will be prepared if anything goes wrong plus the ingredients won’t got to waste because you can always use them later in the week.

Finally, consider purchasing tickets to a sporting event or concert for your date on Valentine’s Day. This is a great gift if it something you both enjoy but you can wind up needing a plan B if the event or concerts are cancelled for some reason. If you are planning to go to a sporting event and it is cancelled you can have a plan B by inviting your date home to watch highlight tapes of previous games. You can assemble this video beforehand and if the game is not cancelled you can always give it to your date after the game. In the case of a cancelled concert you can create a CD of your favorite songs by the band you were going to see.
