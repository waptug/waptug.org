College Scholarship for Students with Interests in Music


Education is the key for a successful career, which is why it is the primary responsibility of all parents to send their children to school. Although education is a necessity, not all parents are able to fund their children's schooling. Others usually stop after they graduate from high school.

This is truly happening in almost any part of the world, and according to statistics, the number is increasing year after year. And this is probably why the government and other private organizations are looking for ways to give scholarships to capable students with limited financial resources.

Students are not alike; in fact, each individual has his/her own distinct characteristic and talent. Some students have talents in the arts, dancing, singing, and music. Now, there are scholarships for particular fields of interest. And if you do love music very much, there are a lot of scholarships for college music.

Music is very popular, and many students are becoming interested in this certain area. Although some parents may not like their children to pursue a career in music (because what they want is a more stable career), students have a choice.

Here is a list of some of the music scholarships available for students:

1.	vocal scholarship from Bel Canto; this foundation awards over $15,000 to opera singers with ages ranging from 20-37 who want to pursue an opera career in America
2.	John Lennon program for BMI scholarship; this is a scholarship awarded to songwriters who are able to write original compositions. But you can only take advantage of this scholarship if you are invited
3.	Scholarship award by String Magazine; this is open for students who are currently in undergraduate program; the award is usually based on academic merit, community service and financial need.
