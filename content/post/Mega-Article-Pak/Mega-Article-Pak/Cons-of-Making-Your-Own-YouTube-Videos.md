Cons of Making Your Own YouTube Videos

Are you interested in making your own videos to upload to YouTube?  While a large number of YouTube members do so, you may want to seriously examine your decision before actually making it.  As nice as sharing YouTube videos with the rest of the YouTube community can be, there are some cons or disadvantages to doing so.  Just a few of the most popular ones are briefly touched on below.

Perhaps, the biggest con to making your own YouTube video is that you don’t actually know who will end up watching it.  Many YouTube video submitters don’t necessarily know that anyone can watch their videos.  YouTube gives internet users, even those who don’t bother to register for a free YouTube account, the ability to watch videos on their website.  Yes, the good news is that your video may be viewed by thousands of people, but do you really want that many people to see your YouTube videos?  That is a question that you will definitely want to ask yourself before uploading your first YouTube video.  

One of the reasons why it is advised that you determine ahead of time, whether or not you really want to share your videos with the rest of the world is because once you do it may be too late.  YouTube allows video submitters to pull their videos from the site, should they change their mind about having a particular video posted online.  While this is nice and the removal happens right away, it may already be too late.  A large number of internet users are able to copy or save videos that they find online, including YouTube videos.  Should your video fall into the wrong hands, it may never really disappear, as you may find it posted on other area of the internet.

Another con or disadvantage to making your own YouTube videos is that strangers essentially get to know you.  The amount of information they find out about you will depend on the video type that you submit to YouTube.  For instance, a stranger watching your YouTube video may be able to learn more about you if you posted a video blog than they would if you posted a comedy skit that you made with your friends.  That is why you should not only think about whether or not you want to post a video on YouTube, but you should also think about your safety.  Keeping internet safety in mind, like not divulging too much personal information, is a great way to enjoy YouTube without any dangers.  

As you likely already know, you need to have a few items to be able to upload videos to the YouTube website.  If you are planning on making videos just for YouTube, you will need to have a video recording device.  The good news is that there are a number of devices that can be used, including camcorders, cell phones, and webcams.  You should also have movie editing software installed on your computer, as it will enable you to review or even edit your YouTube videos before posting them.  If you have an older computer, you may need to purchase a movie editing software program, but many new computers come with these types of programs already installed.  

Although it may seem like there are a large number of cons or disadvantages to making and sharing videos on YouTube, there are actually a number of benefits to doing so as well.  One of those benefits is that it is easy to do.  Once you have your video installed on your computer and edited, if you wish to do so, the uploading process is really easy.  In fact, YouTube explains the uploading process in an easy, step-by-step way.  Even if you don’t have a lot of experience with using computers, you should easily be able to upload one of your videos to YouTube.

If you would like to upload a video to YouTube, after carefully thinking about your decision to do so, you will need to register with YouTube to get a free account.  This account will not only enable you to share your videos with the internet community, but it will also allow you to rate videos that you watch or even have online discussions with other YouTube members.
