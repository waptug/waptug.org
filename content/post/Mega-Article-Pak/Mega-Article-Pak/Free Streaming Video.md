Where to Find Free Streaming Video

There are a number of people that probably do not realize how many places from which they are able to get free streaming video clips from around their home.  For many people, this may be a result of not knowing what the term streaming means.  Most people are aware that the term video refers to the pictures and images, sometimes moving and other times still, that are played out over a screen for individuals to view and absorb.  Sometimes videos are coherent and act out a scene, other times the videos are less obvious and their reasoning is less easy to understand.  However, where many people get lost is understanding what streaming is.

When a video is streamed, it is constantly sent from one source to another.  This enables the recipient to be able to receive the video whenever they want, and it is very convenient for the recipient since they are able to decide when they want to and when they do not want to view the streaming video that is offered to them.  Free streaming video is the type of video that is offered constantly to the individual from a source point, and it does not cost the individual anything to view the video that is streaming from the origin.  

The internet is a great source of free streaming video clips.  This is because there have been many sights set up to providing just this type of entertainment to individuals.  Some of the content is generic and other videos are much more specific.  As with other areas in the world in which videos are shown, there are specific genres when it comes to the free streaming video, and individuals looking for particular genres can usually find acceptable videos.  Some of the free streaming video clips are very short and others are very long.  Sometimes a website will host a whole slew of different types of free streaming video clips, but in other cases the video clips will be specific to one particular type of genre.  While some websites may host videos that have been put together by amateurs, there are some that will only host videos that are more professionally made.  The television is also a great example of free streaming video, since basic cable channels are almost always broadcasting, or streaming, and they do not cost money for those who wish to watch the programs on those channels.  

Some platforms offer free streaming video and streaming video that is not free.  Both the internet and the television are great examples of these platforms.  Some websites will either charge per video or a membership fee, as a flat charge for viewing some of the streaming video.  At the same time, there are some channels on the television that viewers will have to pay for before they can watch it.  Regardless of whether or not individuals pay for any of their streaming video, some of the streaming video offered on the platforms will be free for them to view on a regular and consistent basis.
