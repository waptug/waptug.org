eBay Users:  The Importance of Knowing and Following All eBay Rules

Are you an eBay member?  If so, do you consider yourself to be a relatively new eBay member?  If you have just recently started buying or selling on eBay within the past few months you may be.  As time passes, you will likely become more aware of how eBay works. For instance, if you are an eBay seller, you may find new ways to improve your eBay listings or if you are an eBay buyer, you may find new ways to get great deals.  One thing that you will likely do, overtime, is learn more about eBay’s rules.

As you likely already know, eBay is considered one of the world’s most popular online marketplaces.  eBay gives internet users, like you, the option to buy and sell online.  While giving all internet users the ability to buy and sell is nice, it can make for some problems, particularly concerning security or inappropriate content.  That is why eBay, like all other online marketplaces, has developed a set of rules or guidelines that you must follow, whether you are an eBay buyer or an eBay seller.  You should not only familiarize yourself with those rules, if you haven’t already done so, but you also need to follow them.  

If you are an eBay seller, one of the most important eBay rules that you need to abide by is prohibited items.  Although just about anything can be sold on eBay, there are a few restrictions.  For instance, alcohol, drugs, pornography, and stolen merchandise are just a few of the many items that all eBay sellers, including you, are prohibited from selling.  Another eBay rule that you must follow, as an eBay seller, is to pay all of your eBay fees on time.  eBay has a set pay schedule, which you will be notified of in advance.  To be able to keep on making a profit selling merchandise on eBay, you will want to make sure that you pay your eBay fees on time.  

If you are an eBay buyer, instead of an eBay seller, you will also have to know and abide by all eBay rules.  One of those rules is bidding only on items that you intend to buy.  If you place a bid on an eBay auction or if you agree to buy an item listed in a “Buy It Now,” listing format, you must do so.  That rule is stated in eBay’s guidelines.  If you do not feel that you can pay for the items that you bid on or agreed to pay for, it is best if you stay away from eBay for the time being.  Another eBay rule that you must follow is being honest with your purchases.  If you don’t receive an eBay purchase, it is fine to report that, but give it a few extra days for your item to arrive. Although eBay scams are often associated with sellers, many buyers are beginning to stir up trouble.  This involves reporting that they had not received an item, when they actually did; thus resulting in a refund, as well as the purchased item.  

In most cases, you will find that it is relatively easy to get caught breaking eBay’s rules. That is why it is advised that you not only know all of eBay’s rules, but that you also abide by them. Should you not, you may end up suffering the consequences.  One of those consequences involves having your eBay account temporarily suspended or even permanently suspended.  In rare, but serious cases, the authorities may be contacted or legal action may be taken against you.  In all honesty, the action taken depends on the parties involved.  
Despite the varied consequences for breaking eBay’s rules, it is extremely important that you take the time to examine all of eBay, including the sites rules, restrictions, and guidelines, before you get yourself into trouble that is difficult to get out of.
