The Jeremy McGrath Invitational 

Jeremy McGrath is a well-known supercross rider.  In fact, his name is known by those who are not even fans of the sport. Throughout his career, he has achieved a number of victories.  In addition to victories, he has also set a number of records.  Unfortunately, the time has come where Jeremy McGrath has decided that he would no longer like to actively compete in supercross motorcycle racing, even part-time, like he did in the past.  However, before he ends his career, he will be racing at one last event event.  This event is one that bares his name and symbolizes the success that he had achieved over the years; that event is the Jeremy McGrath Invitational.  

The Jeremy McGrath Invitational is set to take place October 6th and October 7th of 2006. The two day event will be held in Carson, California.  In fact, it will be held at the Home Depot Center, which is located on the California State University Campus.  Although it would be best to see this event live in person, due to its location, you may be unable to. If this is the case, you will find that you should be presented with a number of different chances to watch the invitational.  One of those times being October 22nd 2006 on NBC.  

If you are wondering why the Jeremy McGrath Invitational is worth seeing live or worth watching on television, you are not alone.  To supercross motorcycle racing fans, this can easily be considered the event of the year, but others wonder what is so great about it.  The answer, honestly, is everything.  The Jeremy McGrath Invitational is unlike many traditional supercross motorcycle racing events. The first being that the invitational is taking place during the sport’s off-season.  One of the reasons for this is that it allows the top names in supercross racing, from all around the world, attend the event.

As previously mentioned, some of the biggest names in supercross racing are being invited to participate in this event.  These names include, but are in no way limited to, Chad Reed, Jeremy McGrath, James Stewart, and Ricky Carmichael.  Not only will it give these riders the opportunity to showcase their skills and enjoy the sport that they love, in the off-season, they will also be able to win a large amount of money.  The purse, otherwise known as the event payout, totals $500,000. That $500,000 is the largest purse ever recorded in a supercross motorcycle racing event.  

The racing surface, also referred to as the supercross track, will be one of the best ever created.  It is being designed by Jeremy McGrath and a professional track builder, Randy Mennenga.  Essentially, this means that the track will be top of the line and, perhaps, the best that the sport has ever seen.  On that track, head to head races will occur, as well as the main events for each night. The main events, like most other supercross racing main events, will showcase the racing abilities of twenty drivers; the twenty that were invited to the event. According to the website of the Jeremy McGrath Invitational, the champion will be crowned based on the performances given on both days.  

If you are lucky enough to attend this event, you will enjoy the racing, as well as the other features that are offered. Like many other racing events, pit passes will be offered.  With a pit pass, you may not only get to meet your favorite rider, but you could also see, up close and personal, what goes on behind the scenes.  In the pit area, you will find the racing teams working to get their team and equipment geared up for the main event.  This feature is a must see experience for all supercross motorcycle racing fans, especially if you have never had the opportunity to do so in the past.  

In addition to supercross motorcycle racing, the Jeremy McGrath Invitational, is also giving professional freestyle rides the opportunity to showoff their stuff.  It has been noted, that these demonstrations will take place in-between the main racing events.  So, in addition to heart pounding racing, you can also see a number of neat tricks and stunts. This is amazing considering that everything is happening all with one event, the Jeremy McGrath Invitational.
