The Remote Control Helicopters in Toronto

As you know, helicopters are not just a commodity in the United States, but rather they are well known throughout the world for being one of the best ways to get around.  And if you are hoping to own a helicopter on a smaller level, then you should check out remote control helicopters.

In fact, if you are Canadian, or just love the Canadian landscape and are willing to travel, then you should think about applying for the remote control helicopters training and aficionado club in Toronto.  This Canadian city is known among other helicopter fliers to be a hotspot for helicopter purchases, and it seems like there is always a helicopter in the air in this area.  But the real purpose of the remote control helicopters in Toronto club is their attempt to get a remote control helicopter to fly over the beautiful Niagara Falls.

If you have ever been to Canada, or if you are lucky enough to reside there, then you know that the Niagara Falls are one of the most magnificent sights to be beheld in the entire world.  I have had the opportunity to see the Falls both in the summer when the weather is warm and they plummet to the bottom of the water, and in the winter, when the entire falls freeze over in the cold Canadian climate.  Both sights were breathtaking, and that’s why I was so thrilled to learn about the remote control helicopters in Toronto club’s initiative to fly their remote control helicopters over the falls in both the summer and the winter.  Apparently, each year, they have two day-long competitions, much like the summer and winter Olympics, which they train for all year long.  People come from all over the world, not just from Toronto, with their beautifully crafted helicopters, and many of the people actually make the helicopters themselves rather than purchase them from a store.  Anyway, they get together and fly these beautiful things over the falls, and they go in various “heats” which are basically like qualifying rounds, and then the best two at the end challenge each other for a battle of speed across the falls.

The winner gets $50,000 and a vacation to, you guessed it, Niagara Falls for next year’s competition.  This has been going on for years, and people get really excited about it!  I am gearing up to go to Toronto next year to see some of the training trials, and then I’m going to go to Niagara itself the following year to see one of the actual competitions.  I don’t believe I am good enough yet to actually compete, but I’m still young, so hopefully in a few years I’ll be ready.  I can tell you that I am training like you wouldn’t believe, and I am really looking forward to the day when I can craft my own helicopter and watch it sail majestically over the Niagara Falls.  If you are interested, maybe someday this can be your dream as well.

My advice would be to start flying your own remote control helicopters as soon as possible, and sign up for the club in Toronto right away.
