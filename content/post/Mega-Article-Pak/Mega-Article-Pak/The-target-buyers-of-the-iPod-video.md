The target buyers of the iPod video
	
	
Every new release of a product gets the interest of a particular type of people. While men seem more interested in technology and women in beauty products, while teens are fond of games and music and adults more of books, the marketers precisely know, before launching a new product, the main target of their new item. For example, the iPod video is one of the new releases which defiantly have a specific type of buyers. 
	
The target buyers of this new device are, for sure, young people and adults which are trying to buy a great present for their children. In this example, the critics say that in many cases, the adults do not know the features of the new device well and all the things that it can be used for. So, one of the most important worries that parents should have is the fact that some children might use the iPod to directly download (as this new iPod video allows to do so) some materials from sites destined to adults only. More precisely, the target customers of the iPod video are somewhere between the ages of 16 and 30, but there are various categories which don’t fit in this group, too. Among these, there are the people above 30 years which want to remain modern and keep focused on the new releases in the technology department. Even more, there are various customers which own an iPod from the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th generation and simply want to upgrade their item and to be able to watch clips and movies on the device, as well. 
	
On the other hand, the sales so far clearly indicate the fact that the new iPod video is bought more by men then by women. In many cases, the iPod is bought in order to be offered as a gift for various occasions, as it is consistent, original and useful. 
	
Due to the fact that the new iPod video represents quite and investment, there are rare cases in which teens might purchase one of these with their own money. Still, parents seem disposed to pay the necessary amount of money in order to see their children happy. The sales of the iPod video showed the fact that the device sells best before Christmas and before the summer holiday. Due to the fact that the usage of the new iPod video is one of the most pleasant ways to spend the time, (as it offers both video and audio possibilities), the iPod is intensely used while people are on vacation. 
	
The new iPod video has a lot of fans so far and even more people are interested in the new features that the iPod can provide, thinking of purchasing the item themselves. So far, the sales say that the number of the buyers is increasing and the people become more and more receptive to the device and its capacities. At the same time, people adapt fast to the new technology, so they expect even more from the next iPod of the Apple Company. Due to this, the team of engineers already works on the next and more optimized iPod, which will bring, besides many new features and accessories, an innovative new capacity, which will surprise the market.
