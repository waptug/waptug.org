Gas Diesel Hybrid War

These days, gasoline prices may be crimping your
your household budget.  You may like to reduce
the U.S. dollars that flow to the Middle East for
oil, or perhaps you are motivated by your concern
for the environment, or even the nagging reality
that oil is a depleting resource that shouldn't
be wasted.

Fuel economy
To put it into prospective, the fuel economy are
the numbers posted on the window sticker of a new
vehicle.  Studies have shown that the average 
driver only receives 75 percent or so of the 
mileage figures that are on the sticker.

You can use these numbers to determine the best
type of vehicle for your purchase.  The numbers
will let you know how many MPG your vehicle will
get, so you can compare vehicles and then go 
from there.

Hybrid pricing
The gas electric hybrid vehicles are normally
priced higher than non hybrid counterparts,
anywhere from a couple of thousand dollars to
several thousand dollars.

Hybrids can get a lot of miles per gallon,
some averaging around 45 - 55.  This is great
for those who want to save money on gas, as 
hybrids can go many miles on a full tank of
fuel and they come with extended warranties
as well.

Diesel efficiency
Diesel powered vehicles are yet another fuel
efficient option.  Diesels are known for getting
extra mileage from every gallon of fuel.  They
offer much better torque than many gasoline
engines.  The price differential they have 
over gasoline engines are usually much smaller
than that of the hybrid.

With plenty of options available, you're sure
to find what you need to help conserve fuel. 
Before you make a purchase, always remember
to shop around and find what's best for you.
