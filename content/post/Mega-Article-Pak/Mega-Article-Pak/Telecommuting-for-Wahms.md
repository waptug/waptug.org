Telecommuting for Wahms

Before you try to find a Work from home job on the Internet, consider looking for a telecommuting position within your own company or your own field. Telecommuting is quickly becoming a viable option for office professionals and businesses alike. Telecommuting originated from the need for businesses to reduce expenses, and the need for workers to spend more time at home. In addition, workers receive many other added benefits.

Telecommuting normally entails going into the office for a few days a week, and then working from home for the remainder of the time. In some cases, you can even telecommute full time from your home office. All you’ll need is reliable telecommunications gear like a PC, high speed Internet, fax and phone line. 

Telecommuting has several benefits for the employee. First, by becoming a Wahm, you’ll have special tax advantages that can save you hundreds of dollars each year. You’ll also save on gas costs and wear and tear on your vehicle. Your budget for a work wardrobe will be reduced since you’ll be in the office less, or not at all. No more spending money on eating out at lunch since you can make your own meals at home. 

You’ll also benefit health wise. People who work at home tend to have less stress levels because they can work in a relaxed environment. Lower stress means a healthier body and mind. You’ll gain more time in each day because you won’t have to spend upwards of 5 hours each week on the road. Finally, you won’t have to deal with office politics. Many people who telecommute find that they are able to work more efficiently without interruptions from the cubicle next door or the latest office gossip.

If you currently work a position that you believe can be done from a home office, then its best to prepare a case to show your supervisors. Asking to telecommute is not something that you should just ask randomly one day. Gather statistics on how much businesses save every year by allowing their employees to telecommute. Find articles that tout the benefits of telecommuting, from the business point of view. There are lots of benefits for you, but your employer will want to hear what is in it for them. You’ll also want to provide your supervisor with the specific duties that you expect to complete from home. Show them how the arrangement will work and make the decision very easy for them.

If you want to work from a strictly work at home company, then you’ll need to get your resume together and start applying for jobs. Keep in mind that there are thousands, if not millions, of other people trying to obtain telecommuting positions. Don’t wait to hear back from one position to try applying to another one. Send out your resume to as many companies as you can. Eventually, you’ll find the right position for you. 

Remember, when you start your job search, that legitimate companies will never make you pay to work for them. Unfortunately, since telecommuting is such a hot field right now, there are many scammers out there who try to take advantage of people who want to work from home. Protect yourself by researching an opportunity thoroughly before giving your personal information or any funds..
