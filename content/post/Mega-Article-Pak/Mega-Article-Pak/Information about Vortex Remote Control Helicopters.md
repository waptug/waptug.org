Information about Vortex Remote Control Helicopters

When I was purchasing my third helicopter, I remember hearing about vortex remote control helicopters, but having no idea what type they were.  For instance, what exactly is a vortex, anyway?  In essence, a vortex is an instrument that spins something to create a vortex of wind or liquid, which is basically in the shape of a tornado.  If you’ve ever done the hurricane experiment with a two liter bottle of soda, then you’ve made a vortex.

With vortex remote control helicopters, the vortex is created in the air such that there is an invisible stream that basically is in the same shape as a tornado.  Anyway, I usually advise people to make a list of all their requirements in a remote control helicopter, before going into the store to make a purchase.  The reason for this is that people will often chose a helicopter based on attraction to superficial things like color, or because the helicopter has a good price and they thing helicopters are all the same.  But they are truly not, and it is very important to make sure that you know what you are looking for and that you go into the helicopter purchase with a level head and a clear mind.  Don’t just look for the flashiest colors.  That said, people often ask me then, what should I be looking for in a helicopter, anyway?

Well, essentially, it’s really a toss up which is the best helicopter to buy, and you need to be introspective and consider the things that you need when purchasing your helicopter.  Either way, best of luck with your helicopter purchase.  But if I could offer some advice, I would recommend that people go with durability and not outward appearance, unless money is a non-issue, in which case they can look into purchasing a top of the line helicopter in every way imaginable, which will be both well made and durable.

This is often the case with vortex remote control helicopters.  They are well made and the manufacturers of vortex remote control helicopters often pay close attention to detail and are capable of making helicopters that are really pleasing to the eye.  But they really are expensive, and you need to consider that.  For instance, are you planning on using the vortex remote control helicopters in a nationwide contest that could win you a lot of money?

Such contests exist, and if you enter in one, you really should consider buying a top of the line helicopter because anything less would never win you any money.  Plus, in that case, the helicopter could probably pay for itself!  But if you are looking into purchasing a helicopter for purely recreational reasons, then maybe it is better to just get the best one you can in your price range, and be careful with it so you don’t break it.  As a careful planner and purchaser, you can usually get a helicopter that will last you many years of enjoyable playtime and that you can proudly show off to others.
