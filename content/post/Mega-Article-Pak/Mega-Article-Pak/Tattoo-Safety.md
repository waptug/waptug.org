Tattoo Safety

The process of tattooing involves needles that move at very fast speeds to penetrate the outer layers of the skin.  The needles break the skin, and inject dots of ink into the third layer, creating the image of the tattoo design in the skin.  Whenever you are getting a tattoo, common sense and a bit of safety are always the most important considerations.

When getting a tattoo, most people fear getting the virus known as HIV, which can lead to the dreaded AIDS virus.  Although many fear HIV, it is just one of the many viruses that can result from tattoos.  Staph, syphilis, tuberculosis, and hepatitis are all but a few of the other diseases that can result from tattoos.  All it takes is a dirty or unsanitary needle and you could wind up contracting one of the deadly viruses listed above.

Just like other activities, tattooing can be very dangerous.  Although tattooing is indeed dangerous, there are ways that you can minimize or eliminate the potential dangers.  Each and everyday, tattoo artists have to adhere to a strict code of safety to ensure that the risk of contracting HIV or any other diseases is little to none.

Professional tattoo artists will sterilize their equipment after each use.  They use steam pressure autoclave when disinfecting their tattoo guns and needles.  Bleach and alcohol don’t sterilize the equipment; they are instead used to prep the equipment.   Once the bleach and alcohol have been used on the instruments, they will then be autoclaved, which will sterilize them.

When the tattoo artist does the tattoo, he should always wear rubber gloves that can easily be disposed of.  The ointment spreaders and any type of rags that are used should also be disposable.  When you walk into the tattoo studio, the floors should be spotless.  In the rooms where the tattoos are done, the working area should always be clean and sanitary.

Before the tattooist starts the tattoo, he should always give each customer a brand new set of fresh needles.  Then, he should always dip the needle in a small cap of pigment that he just took out of a large squeezable bottle.  If the artist dips the needle into the big bottle, you may very well be sharing fluids with those who have had tattoos from that same big bottle.

Whenever you decide to get a tattoo you should always put safety first.  Safety is very important with tattoos, as you could otherwise get a disease or a serious infection.  Before you decide on a tattoo studio, you should always make sure that they are clean and sanitary.  If you get a tattoo from a studio that is dirty or unsanitary, you could wind up on a never ending spiral of infections and viruses.
