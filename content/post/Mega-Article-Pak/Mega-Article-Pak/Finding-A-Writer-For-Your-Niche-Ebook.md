Finding a Writer for Your Niche Ebook

Internet niche marketing campaigns can often be handled by one person with one small exception. Unless the person orchestrating the campaign is a particularly gifted writer, the creation of content relevant to the niche should be handled by a professional writer. The required content may include concise content for e-newsletters and websites or more in depth content for full length ebooks. Ebooks are the electronic version of books. They are distributed in electronic formats and made available to readers via email or the Internet. This article will focus primarily on ebooks and will discuss the subjects of outsourcing an ebook and finding the best writer for the job. 

Outsourcing Your Ebook

Those who are involved with promoting an Internet niche campaign are likely very passionate about their niche subject but their passion alone does not qualify them to write an ebook on the subject. They should be heavily involved in the creation of the outline for the ebook and they should have final editing rights on the ebook but a professional writer should be the one responsible for writing the initial draft of the ebook. They may also me responsible for making revision based on the comments by the marketer and his staff. 

For this reason, many Internet marketers are outsourcing the writing of their ebooks. This is a wise decision because keeping a writer on staff exclusively for the purpose of writing ebooks can be quite costly if there is not a constant need for ebooks. However, outsourcing the work to independent contractors can be a much more affordable option. In this scenario, the marketer can negotiate the writing of each ebook individually or they can enlist and individual or consulting firm to complete a set number of ebooks. 

Finding the Right Person for the Job

Once you have made the wise decision to outsource your ebook, it is time to begin the process of finding the perfect writer to complete the ebook. There may be a number of factors you consider in choosing a writer. Some of these factors may include price, previous experience and quality of provided writing samples. Prioritizing these factors is the first step in the process because it will be very helpful in the decision making process. For example if cost is the highest priority followed by quality of writing samples and then experience in the niche you might be tempted to hire a writer who is slightly less adept but willing to work for a lower fee. 

The search for the talented writer to assist you can begin either locally or globally. You can conduct a local search by placing an advertisement in local newspapers or trade magazines. A global search can begin on the Internet where there are many websites available for those who wish to outsource work. In either scenario your advertisement should suggest relevant information you would like applicants to provide. 

Whether you decide to conduct your search locally or globally you will likely receive multiple responses to your advertisement. Begin evaluating these responses by eliminating those that are of poor quality. This is important whether or not quality of work is your top priority because poor work is not worth even the most affordable price. Next evaluate the remaining applicants according to your prioritized list of criteria and rank them accordingly. 

Now consider contacting the top three applicants for an interview. The interview can be conducted in person, via telephone or online. This step is important because it will give you a good idea of whether or not you think the applicant will be able to meet your expectations. During this time you should also discuss scheduling to determine whether or not the applicant is available to complete the project according to your time line.

After this interview process, it is time to make a decision. Just because it is time to make a decision does not mean you have to outsource your project to one of the applicants you interviewed. Your decision may be to hire one of the applicants, interview a few of the applicants who were lower on your list or repost your advertisement and solicit new applications.
