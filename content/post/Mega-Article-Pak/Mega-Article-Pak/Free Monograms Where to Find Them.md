Free Monograms: Where to Find Them

Free things in life are hard to come by. You probably won't see too many things that are free of charge. And if you do, let's just say that you'll get what you pay for. Maybe if you're incredibly lucky, you'll gather a couple of free items in your lifetime to sell at yard sales.

But when we do get access to free stuff, sometimes it's not totally lame. Sure, maybe you could live without your free keychain. Perhaps life would still be the same without that free souvenir mug your co-worker picked up for you. And maybe, just maybe you could survive without those free monograms.

Actually, free monograms are pretty neat. They may be a small insignificant design, but they can still add a personal touch to your stationery. Of course, it takes time and resources to create a monogram and apply it to a letterhead or a piece of clothing. With this in mind, where would free monograms be found?

Free monograms can be found as an option on many small items. Some banks will allow you to personalize your checks. You can add a monogram or alter the lettering styles with no extra cost.

Certain washroom accessory stores offer free monograms on their items. You can add your initials to towels. This will make you feel like a king after relaxing with a nice hot shower. You can also add a special touch to your bed pillows and covers to give your bedroom a more personal feel.

If you want to avoid mix-ups at the airport, a free monogram on your briefcase will do just that. Your luggage will be easily distinguishable from similar types of baggage. This will certainly save some time and effort in finding your briefcase.

Even custom rubber stamps can come with a free monogram. These will help give anything you stamp a unique touch. Some companies will even allow you to use your own custom graphic with no extra charge.

Products from Lillian Vernon also feature free monograms. Almost anything you purchase from this company will monogram it for free. This includes small and big items like office accessories and fireplace grates.

The Vera Bradley company also has free monograms on certain items. You can get a monogram on placemats or duffel bags. It's a nice feature to add on an already fashionable design.

Jewelry is also yet another item that can have a free monogram added to it. If an inscription doesn't suit your tastes, you can add a special design to a piece of jewelry. That special person will appreciate the thought that you cared a lot should you decide to personalize their jewelry gift.

It looks like free stuff doesn't have to be a complete waste. A couple of items may turn out somewhat useful, and a few items are cooler than others. Still, nothing beats the level of customization and personality that a monogram offers. Being able to add your own style for free to an already purchased item is well worth the price.
