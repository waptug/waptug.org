Making the decision to get your closet organized is a step in the right direction. The task can see too much in the beginning, but with some helpful tips you will get the job done. The amount of closet space isn’t what is important – how you use it is! Break the entire task down in to small, achievable steps. This will keep the project from seeming like it is too much to tackle. The first order of business is to decide to eliminate clutter from your closet forever. 

Remove everything from your closet. Be honest about what you find in there. Analyze each and every item. Getting rid of things if very easy for some people, but harder for others. Why keep dealing with these items though each and every time you open up your closet? I understand some articles in your closet may have sentimental value. Store them in an air tight container in another area of your home. 

If a piece of clothing hasn’t been worn in at least one year consider donating it to a worthy cause. If you have worn out shoes that you never wear get rid of them. If it doesn’t fit then get it out of your closet. If you have items that need to be sewn or have alterations done, this is the time to do it before you place those items back into the closet. Anything that you have just stuck in your closet for lack of a better place for it needs to be removed from your home or given a proper location. 

Come up with a system for organizing your clothing. This can be by color, style, or season. You can also choose to separate them by where you wear them such as around the house, work, and casual. A good idea is to hang all the pieces of a particular outfit together. Keep in mind the goal is to maximize the amount of space you have available in your closet. 

Make a list of what you want in your custom closet organization. Do you love shoes? Then you might need a great deal of storage for all of them. Maybe you need shelves for your sweaters or your favorite books you keep in the closet. Start planning your closet organization by measuring the length and the depth. You will need this information to start figuring out how many shelves and shoe racks you can install. 

What type of look do you want to accomplish and how much money are you willing to invest in this project? Do you want the organization shelves and items to be permanent or something you can easily remove later? The answers to these questions will help you determine the type of materials you will use to complete your closet organization. You can choose from wood, wire items, baskets, canvas, plastic, and anything else you want to consider. 

The key is to eliminate anything you don’t really need from your closet and then set the remaining items up in a way that works well for you. All of us have different ways of organizing so make your system unique to you. This will help you stick with returning items to their proper location in the closet.
