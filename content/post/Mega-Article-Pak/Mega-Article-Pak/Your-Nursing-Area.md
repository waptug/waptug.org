Your Nursing Area

Once you've reached the third trimester, you'll
probably start stocking up on nursing bras, breast
pads, and loose button down shirts for the coming
months ahead.  While getting ready to breast feed,
you can also create your personal area, a custom
designed breast feeding area for yourself.

Your nursing area should reflect your personality.
If you like a loud, yet friendly surrounding, you
should consider setting in a corner of the living
room or family room.  Keep an extra chair or two
near you so family members or even friends can keep
you company.

If you prefer peace and quiet, a cozy study or 
empty guest room would be ideal.  You can close
the door, dim the lights down, then take a few
deep, calming breaths while you breast feed.

Your own chair
No matter if it's a glider, overstuffed recliner,
or desk chair with wheels, you should make sure
your nursing chair is very comfortable.  You'll
be sitting in the chair for hours each day, so
you'll want it to be very comfortable.  You should
always look for one that offers back and shoulder
support, along with arm rests.

Support underfoot
You can use a footstool, low coffee table or a
stack of pillows to elevate your feet as you breast
feed.  If you raise your legs and feet to bring
your baby to your breast, you'll avoid possible
backache.

Pillows and more pillows
Your neck, arms, feet, and back will need as 
much support as you can give, so don't hesitate
to surround your body with pillows.  If you lay
a pillow across your lap for your baby to lay on,
he'll be very comfortable and that much closer to
your nipple.  For extra comfort, you can even 
purchase a specially made nursing pillow that 
will encircle your waist.

Table for one
You should always keep a small table or stand
within arm's length of your breast feeding chair.
What you use should be big enough to hold a
coaster and glass of liquid.  Some women prefer
to drink through a straw, while others prefer to
drink from the glass.  

You'll also want to keep healthy snacks on hand
as well, such as fresh fruit, nuts, or crackers
and peanut butter to help you replace the 
energy you use while you breast feed.

Distractions
If your baby is a slow eater or has a really big
appetite, you may want to keep yourself busy 
while he feeds.  You can fill the shelves of a 
nearby cupboard or bookcase with your favorite
books or crossword puzzles to occupy yourself
until your baby is full.  You should also keep
a phone nearby as well so that you can talk to
family or friends to pass the time.
