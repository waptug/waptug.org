Essential Parts

There are many places that you can use to find parts 
for a vacuum cleaner that is broken, providing you
have someone around that is handy enough with tools
to take a swing at fixing it.  The part that breaks
the most on most less expensive vacuum cleaners
is the drive belt.  It's the rubberized belt that 
is around 6 inches long, that when stretched out
turns the brushes on the bottom of the vacuum.

When you take the vacuum over objects that don't
belong in the vacuum cleaner, such as pieces of
rope or a cat's tail and the unit comes to a screeching
halt, the burning smell that will soon fill up the
air is your drive belt slowly melting away.

Luckily, the drive belt is available at several
locations, so many in fact that your local drug
store may even carry them!  They are cheap to buy
and a snap to replace with a screwdriver and a bit
of common sense.  For other types of problems that
you may encounter, there are a lot of resources at
your disposal just in case you decide to tackle
the problem on your own.

You should never forget that when you buy parts for
your vacuum cleaner, most of the parts you'll need
are going to be specifically made for your particular
brand name and model.  With the exception of basic
items such as drive belts and most bags, most parts
aren't interchangeable between brands and between
different models of the same brand.

The first thing to try when you need a part for
your vacuum cleaner is the local Yellow Pages
book.  Inside of the Yellow Pages, you'll find 
many listings for appliance parts and suppliers.
You'll have to call each one of the individually
to find out if they carry parts for your model
and brand.  In the rare event that they don't
carry what you need, they can normally order it
for you quickly and easily.  If that fails, you
can always call the company direct that manufactured
your model of vacuum cleaner and order the part
that way.

Most of the time, you won't have any problem
getting your hands on a part for your vacuum 
cleaner, unless it is a more intricate part that
isn't readily available.  Parts such as the intake
or exhaust port are very tricky to replace, and
you will probably want to have a professional
fix these types of problems.  

Drive belts, vacuum bags, and little problems such
as these are a snap to replace.  With the older
style of vacuum cleaners, you don't have to be
an expert to fix a majority of the problems.  The
newer models however, require quite a bit of
skill and technique.

One of the most common problems that will happen
is clogging.  If your vacuum stops picking up
dirt and dust, chances are it has become clogged,
which is normally not a parts problem.  All you 
need to do to fix it is take the front assembly
off, then manually clean out the agitators and 
the housing where the dirt makes its way upwards
through the vacuum cleaner.  This is very easy
to do, and won't take you but a couple of minutes.

Anytime you encounter a parts problem with your
vacuum cleaner, you should always take things one
step at a time and don't rush.  You can almost
always get a hold of a part.  If the part is more
expensive than you anticipated, you can always
scrap the vacuum cleaner and buy yourself a 
better one - which will save you a lot of time
and headache in the long run.
