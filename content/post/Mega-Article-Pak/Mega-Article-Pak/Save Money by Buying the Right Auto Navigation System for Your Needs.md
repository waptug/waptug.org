Save Money by Buying the Right Auto Navigation System for Your Needs

With so many GPS (global positioning satellite) devices and auto navigation systems on the market today how on earth is someone supposed to choose the system that will be best for you? The answer to that question isn't as difficult as you might think. It all lies in deciding what you will be using your GPS device to accomplish. You need to know where you will be using your device in order to use it properly. By this I mean will you be using your GPS system for driving, biking, hiking, boating, or 'off-roading'? 

Occasionally you will find that your goals and desires of your auto navigation system or GPS will require use in more than one of these instances, the good news is there's a device for that too! Seriously, there is a device that is suitable for almost every possible need and use. If you plan to use your auto navigation system exclusively for driving your automobile, you should probably choose a system such as one of the following: Magellan RoadMate 2200T Portable Navigation System, Garmin StreetPilot c530 Automotive GPS, Tom Tom One, Tom Tom GO 910 Automotive GPS System, or Navman iCN 750 Vehicle Navigation with Camera. These systems each offer something unique to consumers while also delivering some of the same popular features that consumer's love. Some of those features include turn-by-turn directions, landmark identification, important stops and destinations along your route, and popular restaurants along the way.

If you want something that is a little more versatile than your typical stand-alone navigation system or GPS then you might want to check out the many options afforded by the handheld GPS systems on the market today. Many of these will require an upgrade of some sort in order to be useful for turn-by-turn destination information but are excellent for those taking the fun off the beaten path and off road. For those who love adventure in the great outdoors the following handheld GPS systems offer an excellent choice for keeping you on track and in the know: Garmin eTrex Vista Cx Color Handheld GPS Unit, Magellan eXplorist 600, and Lowrance iFinder Hunt Color. 

For those who currently own a laptop or PDA software and hardware add ons can turn your device into a GPS system. These offer a more affordable option to the stand-alone navigation system and are an attractive incentive to many potential consumers. You will also find the widest variety of features within this particular category. Most of these devices offer the hardware as well as the necessary mapping software as part of the package. This allows them to have relative portability while also offering the full features of the stand-alone navigation systems. Some of the laptop or Palm systems that you may wish to consider are the following: Garmin CF Que 1620 Compact Flash GPS, Tom Tom Navigator 6 Bluetooth, DeLorme Earthmate Blue Logger, and the Garmin Mobile 20 Smartphone GPS System.

These are by no means all inclusive of the many wonderful and exciting products that are available in today's market for those interested in purchasing an auto navigation system. You should also keep in mind that new technologies emerge on a daily basis. With that in mind, prices on existing technologies are steadily decreasing, as prices on new items are often still quite high. It is very possible to get a great deal by shopping last year's top of the line navigation toy and skipping the high-end navigation gadgets of the current year.

Another way to save money on navigational aids and devices is not to shop among the top of the line devices. Instead of shopping for those that are priced highest, elect devices within the middle of the price range. These devices generally offer the same excellent quality as the more expensive devices without the over inflated price tags. You should also remember not to pay extra for features that you won't be using. Having an extra feature or two shouldn't be a selling point if you won't be using those features.
