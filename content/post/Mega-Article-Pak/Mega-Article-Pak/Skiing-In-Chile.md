Skiing In Chile

If you are looking for a more exotic skiing trip, why not consider Chile? One of the world’s finest skiing regions, Chile is a great place for skiing enthusiasts of any age any skill level.  Why not consider Chile as an alternative skiing destination with international appeal, and pick up some of the Andean culture along the way!

One of the best resorts in my experience is the La Parva resort, located near Santiago. The La Parva resort is often underrated, billed as second to its higher brother, Valle Nevado.  However, if you are more into skiing across uninterrupted, unspoilt terrain, with more variety and depth of ski, I would most certainly recommend La Parva as the resort for you.  With a total of 14 lifts, the resort is of a medium size, and is comparatively popular, although still free from the depth of tourists covering the more popular, more accessible slopes.  One factor to consider is that the snow coverage is not always as consistent as with other resorts, and this may pose a problem for some skiers, although if you take the time to research the conditions before you go, you should be able to experience La Parva in all its glory.

La Parva also prides itself in a well-equipped training academy, which attracts some of Chile’s best skiing talent.  As well as Olympic training, they also offer public lessons, and have an excellent track record when it comes to improving performance.  The friendly and helpful training staff pride themselves on their heritage, and take great pride in the condition of their slopes the quality of their training, which really shows in their instruction. 

An important word of advice - it is important before setting off for Chile on your skiing trip that you ensure you have your passport in place.  If you don’t have a passport, or if your last passport has expired, it might be a good idea to apply early so you don’t avoid disappointment.  The application and issuing processes can take up to 14 weeks, so it is vital that you budget for this time allotment when booking your skiing vacation.
Similarly, South America can be a dangerous place to visit, and there have been several high profile instances of kidnap by rebel and terrorist organisations in the area.  On this note, it is perhaps best to consult the internet for any government warnings which may be issued, and to keep track of current affairs, although thankfully these instances are becoming rarer in these modern times. 

Why not consider Chile as an ideal candidate for your next skiing vacation?  Ok, so it may be slightly more adventurous than the other locations you thought about, but you really have to wonder why so many people swear by Chile and the La Parva and Valle Nevado resorts, and why the area has become such a hotbed for skiing over the last few decades.  One visit to this amazing country will surely change anyone’s mind, as you begin to understand exactly why Chile is seen as one of South America’s best skiing locations for experts and beginners alike.  With the extended appeal to the culture-vultures among us, Chile is also the ideal place to vacation with your family, and you don’t have to spend all your time skiing to enjoy your vacation.
