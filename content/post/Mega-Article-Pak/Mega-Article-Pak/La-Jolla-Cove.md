La Jolla Cove

The Cove of La Jolla sits below the Ellen Browing
Scripps Park in downtown La Jolla.  The sandy
portion of the beach is quite small, with plenty
of rocky cliffs.  During high tide, the surrounding
rocks will trap the water that stays behind as 
mini tidepools when the tide goes out, giving 
both children and adults something to peer into.

The La Jolla Cove, 1100 Coast Boulevard, is a very
small beach that's tucked between adjacent sand
stone cliffs.  Due to it's amazing beauty, the Cove
is one of the most photographed beaches in the
Southern California area.  Although it's within a
short walking distance of the commercial community
area of La Jolla, the Cove still retains a style of 
it's own.

The north facing has a very unusual amount of coarse
sand.  The grassy area of Scripps Park is on the other
side, and provides a great area for picnics.  The
water visibility at the Cove can sometimes exceed
30 feet, which makes it a very popular area for 
scuba divers and snorklers.

The Cove lies within the San Diego Underwater Park
Ecological Reserve, which will help to ensure that
all marine life remains plentiful.  This area is
look but don't touch, with the possession of game
being against the law.

La Jolla Cove is an excellent area for scuba diving,
especially when surf conditions are low.  Before 
you head to the beach, you should always telephone
the beach information line and check with lifeguards
before you dive.

With plenty to offer your entire family, the La 
Jolla Cove is an excellent beach.  There is plenty
of swimming here, with views of the most beautiful 
water in the area.  If you're looking for a great way
to spend a hot summer day - La Jolla Cove is the 
place.
