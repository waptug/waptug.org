Google Adsense: How Much Money You Can Make and URL Channels Explanation 

How Much Money Can I Make With Google Adsense?

How much do you want to make?  How hard do you want to work?  And how much time do you want to spend working the Google Adsense program?

These are the questions you must ask yourself in order to answer that question.

Look at it this way: how many business opportunities come your way where the only requirement is hard work and the time it takes to work hard?  Not many.  Almost any business venture requires some kind of start-up money.

If  your total earnings is showing 0.00 after a week, not to worry.  Keep reading and learning and working.  If however, you’re still showing 0.00 after a month, it may be time to implement some of those optimization tips you’ll find on the Google Adsense Support Site.  Play around with the placement of the ads on your site.  Consider changing the colors.  Look again at the content. Is it interesting?  

As with any other business, with the Google Adsense program, the sky is the limit. Work hard. Work smart. Have fun.  After all, you’re the boss.

What Are URL Channels and How to Organize Them in Google Adsense

URL Channels allow you to view detailed information about the performance of your  Adsense for Content pages.  

Suppose you have a blog at writingup.com and you also have a blog at bloggerparty.com. It might be interesting and profitable to track which one is getting more clicks.  Log in to your Adsense account and click on Adsense for Content.  Scroll down until you see Channels and click on manage channels.  You may need to scroll up when the next page loads.  Under Manage URL Channels you would type writingup.com and click on Create New Channel.  You will immediately see writingup.com in the Active URL Channels dialogue box  Now type in bloggerparty.com in the same channel text box and again click on Create New Channel.  You now have two channels and you will be able to track your progress on each channel.  You can view channel reports from the Advanced Report page under the Reports tab.  Choose Adsense for Content, choose the date range and then select the Channels Data radio button. Choose any number of active channels by holding down the CTRL key. Next click on Display Report.  It’s as easy as that.
