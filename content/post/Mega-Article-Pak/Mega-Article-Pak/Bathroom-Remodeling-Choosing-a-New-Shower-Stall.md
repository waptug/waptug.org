Bathroom Remodeling:  Choosing a New Shower Stall

In the United States, a large number of homeowners only have a bathtub in their homes. Most bathtubs really aren’t just bathtubs; many also double as showers.  As nice as it is to only have one bathroom fixture, especially one that can do two jobs, you may be looking for more. If you are looking to remodel your bathroom, you may want to think about purchasing yourself a new bathtub.  Unfortunately, you will find that not all bathtubs double as showers; therefore, you may also be in the market for a new shower stall.

Perhaps, the most important thing to remember, when looking to buy a new shower stall, is the amount of space that you have available.  If you are going from one bathtub to a bathtub and a standalone shower, there is a chance that you may be limited on space.  If that is the case, you may find your options to be somewhat limited. That is unless you are planning on remodeling your entire bathroom. If you are planning on changing your entire bathroom around, it may be easier for you to find and purchase the shower stall of your choice, without having to worry about whether or not it will even fit in your bathroom.

Once you have decided that you would like to purchase a new bathroom shower stall, as well as how large of one you can purchase, you will need to start shopping for your shower. Although you may expect to find everything that you need all in one place, it may be a little bit difficult to do. Although there are a number of retailers, particularly home improvement stores, that sell standalone shower kits, there are others who do not. If you are unable to find a retailer who sells shower kits, you may need to purchase all of your parts separately. The parts that you will need may include, but should not be limited to, a shower floor, shower walls, a shower door, as well as a shower head.  

When it comes to buying a new standalone shower, there are many homeowners who go searching for the nicest looking standalone shower.  While there is a chance that you may be looking for the best, there is also a chance that may be remodeling your kitchen on a budget.  If so, you may be pleased to know that standalone showers come in a number of different sizes, shapes, and styles.  Whether you are looking a trendy looking standalone shower or the most affordable one, there is a good chance that you will be able to find exactly what you were looking for. Just in case you were wondering, most standard standalone showers start selling for around two or three hundred dollars, and from there the prices goes up.

As previously mentioned, most home improvement stores, both on and offline, carry a selection of shower supplies, including supplies that are grouped into packages or kits. Therefore, if you are looking to have a new standalone shower in your home, it may be a good idea to shop at one of your local home improvement stores.  In fact, home improvement stores, especially large ones, are known for their displays. In order to find the perfect shower for your soon to be remodeled bathroom, you may want to see these displays; however, if the displays are not as important to you, you may also want to think about shopping online.  Regardless of whether you shop, whether it be online or locally, you will want to try and find shower kits or packages.  These kits and packages are not only convenient, but they may also save you money.

Once you have found and purchased the standalone shower of your choice, you may want to start installing it right away.  Since most standalone shower kits come with instructions, you should easily be able to install your own shower, even if you have no prior home improvement experience. What could be better than having a new shower installed and saving money at the same time?
