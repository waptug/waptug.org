Sony HDR HC3

Home video enthusiasts all across North America are
impressed with the vast range of recording features
offered by the Sony HDR-HC3 handycam video camera.
With both HD and SD modes of recording, you can make
the move to high definition without retaining 
compatibility with standard definition equipment.

The HC3 video camera sets the new standard in resolution
quality with its clear vid image sensor, which 
captures precise detail and superior color.  The dual
record mode will allow you to capture 2.3 megapixel
stills while shooting high definition video.

The smooth slow recording captures fast movement
with precise detail for playing back in slow motion.
Now, you can record what you want however you want
to record it. The HC3 from Sony is everything you could
expect and more. 

2.1 megapixel clear vid CMOS sensor
The clear vid CMOS sensor provides a level of stunning
detail and clarity with amazing video and still 
image performance.  Unlike the traditional CCD
imagers, CMOS sensors require much less power, which
provides better performance for your battery.

Dual record
While you record in HD, you also have the ability
to capture a 2.3 megapixel still image directly to
the memory stick duo media.

HDV/DV format recording
The HDR-HC3 is capable of recording and playing back
both HD and SD video recorded on the standard 
Mini DV tape.

Real time HD codec engine
Sony developed a real time MPEG encoding and decoding
system with a reduced energy consumption along with
a compact size to fit inside of a personal video
camera.  The codec engine provides MPEG 2 compression,
with the recording and playback of clear HD images
at the same bit rate of DV.

10X optical/80X digital zoom
The optical zoom provided by the HDR-HC3 will bring
the action up close from far away.  The digital 
zoom interpolation will make the digital zooming
clearer, with less distortion.

Touch panel
The 2.7" wide (16:9) LCD screen will provide an
excellent viewing clarity with improved resolution.
The 211K pixel LCD screen rotates up to 270 degrees
for multiple viewing angles, while providing a 
sharp, detailed image for monitoring or playback.
The widescreen format makes shooting in 16:9 mode
and composing shots easier than ever before.

With amazing features and video quality, the Sony
HDR-HC3 high defintion video camera is truly one
of the best Sony offers.  If you've been looking
for the perfect HD camera, the HDR-HC3 offers you
more features than you can shake a stick at.
