Exercise And Stress

Even though exercise may not be the most exciting
word in your vocabulary, it sure is a word with a 
lot of benefits.  Participating in daily exercise
will not only make you healthier in general, but
it can also diminish the effects of stress on your
body as well.

Think about all the times you have heard someone
say "the doctor says it's stress related".  Normally
people will laugh it off, concluding that doctors 
say that when they don't know the real answers or
diagnosis.  The truth of the matter is that too
much stress will play a role in many diseases.

To help increase your immune system and decrease 
your stress level as well, try exercise, as movement
is the key word here.  Bending, stretching, reaching
and walking.  There's really no need to buy any
expensive equipment either, as you can implement
more movement into your daily routine and reap
the benefits.

If you like aerobic exercise, you should grab a
partner and have a blast with one of the basic
aerobic videos.  Or, you can simply go out for a 
walk and enjoy spending time together.  As you
may have heard, walking really is the best overall
exercise you can do for your health.  As long as
you have a pair of walking shoes, you'll be
fine.

As you go through your daily activities, make it
a point to walk a little farther, bend down and
pick something up without using a pick up stick
or moving the item towards you with your foot.  
While you are sitting, you should also do some
simple and quick stretches for your neck and 
shoulders.

If you enjoy sitting around watching television,
you should consider buying a jogging board.  
These padded boards will make running, jumping,
or walking in place less stressful on your knees
and joints.  They are easy to store as well and
also very portable.

In many people's opinions, jogging boards are
the best pieces of equipment you can buy.  They
are also far cheaper than bulky treadmills and
stationary bikes.

There are several different exercises that you
can do to help you eliminate the stress in 
your life.  Walking is by far the best, as you
can easily lose yourself and your troubles by
walking.  Even if it is just around the block,
walking can do wonders for your health as well
as stress.

If you have a lot of stress in your life, you
may want to consider a gym.  Working out then
sitting in the sauna is also a good way to
relieve tension.  If your gym has a pool, you
may find swimming to be very beneficial as well,
as it helps you to relax.
