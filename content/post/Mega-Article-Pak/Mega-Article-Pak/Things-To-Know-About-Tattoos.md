Things To Know About Tattoos

Tattoos are created by injecting ink through into the skin.  Tattoo artists accomplish this by using an electric powered tattoo gun that almost sounds like the drill a dentist uses.  The tattoo gun has a needle that moves up and down, putting the ink into the skin around 2,000 times a minute.  The needle in the gun punctures the skin and deposits a small drop of ink with each puncture.

The tattoo machines of today have several basic components.  The sterilized needle, tube system, electric motor, and foot pedal are all fine examples.  The foot pedal is extremely important to the tattoo gun, as it controls the vertical movement that the needle will make.  It resembles a pedal used with a sewing machine, except for the fact that it determines how the needle will work.

One of the biggest concerns regarding tattoos has always been safety.  Tattoo machines work by puncturing the skin and injecting ink into the tattoo site.  Whenever you are dealing with puncture wounds, there is always a risk of infection and disease.  Because of these risks, tattoo applications are always focused on safety.  Tattoo artists always use sterile equipment, disposable materials, and proper sanitation to ensure protection for themselves and their customers.

To help prevent the risk of contamination, almost all tattoo materials such as ink, ink cups, needles, and gloves are for single use only.  Needles should never be used a second time, as they can almost always lead to infection.  Most of the single use products will arrive at the tattoo studio in sterile packaging where the artist can open it up in front of you before he starts his work.

Before they start the tattoo, tattoo artists will always wash their hands with soap and water and check themselves for abrasions and cuts.  After doing so, they will clean and disinfect their work area with the appropriate disinfectants.  As they do this, they will normally explain to you what they are doing and how the sterilization process works.  Once they have cleaned the area, they will then start to open their equipment from the sterile boxes.  After the artist has opened everything, he will shave the area for the tattoo and disinfect it with water and soap.

Once he starts the tattoo, the pain will all depend on your tolerance.  Some people say that it feels like being pinched, while others describe it as a slight poking with needles.  Your overall pain tolerance, the location and size of the tattoo and the experience of the tattoo artist will all be contributing factors to how much pain you will feel.  The location is extremely important.  If you are getting a tattoo in a sensitive area – it will probably hurt a bit more.

The tattoo artist will clean the tattoo throughout the process, and again once he has finished.  Once he has finished, he will put some ointment on the tattoo and cover it.  He will also explain how you should take care of it and what you can and can’t do.  Most tattoo artists will give you a sheet to take home that contains detailed instructions on caring for your new tattoo.  If you have any questions, you shouldn’t hesitate to ask when he is going over your care instructions.

When you get home, you should always follow those instructions.  Taking care of your new tattoo is very important and may very well determine your risk of infection.  Tattoos can be a great thing to have, providing you take care of them.  Keep in mind that the tattoo may be sore for a while – although it will heal in a few short days.
