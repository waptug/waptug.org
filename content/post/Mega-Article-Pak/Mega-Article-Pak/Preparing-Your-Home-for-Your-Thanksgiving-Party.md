Preparing Your Home for Your Thanksgiving Party

Have you officially made the decision to host a Thanksgiving party this year?  If so, congratulations! Although it can be exciting to plan a Thanksgiving party, it can also be a stressful time. That is why you are advised to start your planning as early as you possibly can; it will help to ensure that you get everything done on time. As important as it is to prepare for your party in advance, there are some things that you just can’t do early. One of those things is preparing your home for your party.  In many cases, you will find that you may want to or need to wait till the day or two before your party to start officially preparing your home.

As you likely already know, there are a number of different things that you will need to do, to prepare your home for your Thanksgiving party.  One of those things would be the cleaning of your home. When attending a party, whether your guests be close friends, family members, neighbors, or coworkers, everyone expects to arrive at a clean house.  That is why it may be a good idea for you to clean all the glass in your home, dust everything, as well as vacuum your home or sweep your floors. You will want to place a focus on the rooms that your guests will be using the most, such as the kitchen, bathroom, dining room, or living room.  

There is also a good chance that you will have decorations that you need to hang up; what is a good Thanksgiving party without Thanksgiving decorations?  Whether you have Thanksgiving streamers, balloons, or just table centerpiece decorations, you may want to set them up the day or two before your Thanksgiving party.  Setting them up early, but not too early, will ensure that all of your decorations are up in enough time, but not enough time for them to get dirty or ruined.  

It is also extremely important that you make sure you have enough furniture to accommodate all of your guests.  If your party guests will also be eating dinner at your Thanksgiving party, you will need to make sure that you have enough seating arrangements.  For a large dinner party, it may be a good idea to purchase or rent additional table and chairs. If you need to rent table and chairs, it may be a good idea to put in your rental request early, just in case.  Even if you are only having a Thanksgiving party with snacks and drinks, it is still important to make sure that you have enough chairs for all of your guests; however, extra tables may not necessarily be needed.

In addition to preparing the inside of your home, it may also be a good idea to prepare the outside of it as well.  If you have any garbage or debris around the entranceway to your home, it may be a good idea to remove it.  Depending on where you live, your weather may include snow.  If your walkways are covered with snow or ice, it may be a good idea to clean them, particularly right before your guests are about to arrive. You may also want to think about the parking arrangements, especially if you are planning on having a big party.  You may want to clear as many spots in your driveway or in your yard as you can.  

By keeping the above mentioned points in mind, your home should be clean and ready for when your guests arrive.  That is when the fun can really begin!
