Delegating the Responsibility of Selecting Wedding Favors

For many couples shopping for and selecting wedding favors can seem like an overwhelming task. There are a number of reasons why couples might feel this way. One of the most significant reasons why a couple may feel overwhelmed about selecting their wedding favors is simply because they have so much to do while planning their wedding. There are a number of important details such as selecting a location, choosing centerpieces, coordinating the catering and other details that couples may simply just have too much to do. For these couples it might be a good idea for the couple to delegate the responsibility of selecting the wedding favors to a trusted friend or family member. Of course this is only a viable option if the couple is willing to allow their friend or family member complete freedom to select the wedding favors. If they are constantly trying to oversee the effort it will cause additional stress. This article will examine the concept of delegating the responsibility of selecting wedding favors to a friend or family member and will offer some advice on how to do this and still ensure you will be thrilled with the wedding favors your guests receive at your wedding.

The most important thing to remember when delegating the responsibility of selecting wedding favors to a friend or family member is that you have to carefully discuss your budget with the friend or family member beforehand. The person responsible for selecting the wedding favors should know exactly how much you can afford to spend on wedding favors so they do not exceed this amount. They should also have a good idea of how much you would like to spend on wedding favors is this number is less than the absolute most you are willing to spend. For example you may have $1000 available to spend on wedding favors but you may prefer to spend only $750 if possible. 

Another factor to consider when delegating the responsibility of selecting wedding favors is your own personal taste and preferences. You should discuss your preferences for wedding favors with the person in charge of selecting them beforehand to ensure they will be seeking out wedding favors which you will like. One way to do this is to do a little research before delegating the responsibility. This way you can provide your friend or family member with a few favors which you like as examples of the type of favor you would like to give. This way they will have a good idea of the types of favors you are looking for and will likely select something you will think is appropriate.

Finally, if your friend or family member will not only be selecting the wedding favors for you but also making the purchase, you should make sure they are well aware of how many guests you are expecting and how many favors you would like to purchase. This is very important because it will help to make sure you do not find yourself with too few favors or that your friend or family member doesn’t order too many favors. The number of guests will also be important in the process of selecting wedding favors because this relates closely to your budget. However, if you do not want to give your friend or family member this information or are unsure of how many guests to expect you can give them a budget for the costs of each individual favor instead of an overall budget.
