The New Technology of Auto Sound Systems

So what kind of auto sound system really seems to float your boat? Are you the type of person who wants the simplest sound system on the market today? Will you be content with talk radio and a few FM radio stations? Do you need an 8-track? How about a cassette player? I hate to say it, but if you are still living in the past, you will have a rather difficult time finding an audio system for your car that can accommodate your desire to hold technology behind the current trends. These things simply do not sell. You may find an occasional auto sound system that still has a cassette player but for the most part you will find that the market for this device is almost as limited as the quality of the device itself. 

Today's auto sound systems are more sophisticated than they have ever been before. Gone are the days when you had to turn a dial to find a radio station. Today you can set your car to scan the stations until you find one you like. You can even set them to scan radio stations by type. For me, that was a great invention as I find country music rather sad and always end up finding the one song that will bring uninvited torrents of tears while flipping through the stations mindlessly as I drive. Being someone that hates to cry on any given day it is bad enough to cry. Add to that the fact that I'm probably driving at about 75 or so miles an hour and you can probably see where this is problematic. I do best whenever I can avoid country music stations all together.

Another great technological advance when it comes to the auto sound system is individual volume control. No longer do you have to listen to your mothers, brothers, sisters, or Aunt Sally's music blaring, you can slide on your headphones and mute out the noise of the rest of the world. If your vehicle has a truly sophisticated sound system, you can even change the radio station in order to find music that is much more suitable for your musical tastes. 

You should also be aware that today's auto sound systems are much more user friendly than those of days past. Most displays are digital and easy to read. You might even notice that many can read the local radio stations codes and formats and will list the songs that are playing for you. You'll never have to wonder about the name of that great song you just heard or even who sang it again. It's right before your eyes as you are driving along and listening to awesome tunes.

The best auto sound systems offer not only CD options to drivers and passengers alike but also the ability and capability of reading and interpreting MP3 data as well. More and more people are turning to MP3s for their primary source of music. It takes up far less space than your average CD holder and holds a lot more music. You can download only the songs you like without purchasing an entire CD full of songs only to find that you only liked one song on the entire CD. You can put your favorite songs on a memory stick and bring them along for the ride. It's a great way to enjoy music in this day and age. I'm quite literally surprised that I haven't seen an iPod auto sound system pop up on the radar yet and am seriously expecting to see one any day now, literally.

Regardless of whether or not you wish to enter the modern era of music and music listening it's upon us. However, if you are truly opposed we could always find you a nice supply of Sinatra in MP3 format in order to make the transition a little more comfortable for you.
