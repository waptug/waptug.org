Nice Bachelorette Party Games

Planning a bachelorette party is one of the easiest parts of a wedding to plan. There are literally hundreds of ideas for things to do and a myriad of options for games. Many of those ideas are a bit on the racy side, but there are plenty that that are just plain clean fun. 

For example, one popular bachelorette game involves asking the guests to become poets. Ahead of the party, take 50 index cards and on half, write romantic things, like "roses", "cuddly", etc. On the other 25 cards, write very non-romantic words or phrases, like "nose hairs" or "ironing". Then have each guest draw one card from each pile. They should then create a silly poem based on the two very different words or phrases they have chosen, for example, "Roses are red, your nose hairs are ewwwww."

One fun game that is sure to engender at least a few laughs is "name that item". Take a paper bag (a fabric bag is better if you have one) and fill the bag with typical "male items". The items might include a razor, a money clip, a tie, shoe polish, etc. Seal the bag, or fold it over really well. Then have each guest feel the bag and try to guess the contents. Have them write their guesses on a piece of paper. After everyone has had a chance to feel the bag, the contents are shown and the person with the most number of correct guesses gets the bag of male-oriented items.

Here's a fun idea. This game might take the whole of the bachelorette party, but it's a fun one that involves all the guests, helps them get to know one another and provides video proof you all had a good time. You need video cameras for this game, so if the host only has one camera, be sure to ask guests to bring more video cameras. Make sure you also have enough blank tapes for this game.

Depending on the number of guests at the party, you'll divide the party into two or more groups. It's best to divide the group into teams small enough so that the whole team can get into one car. So you'll have maybe five women on each team. You'll give each team a video camera, blank videotapes and a list of "scavenger hunt" type activities they must perform and tape. 

Some video scavenger hunt ideas include having a complete stranger sing the national anthem, having a member of the team sing "I wish I were an Oscar Meyer hot dog" in the meat section of the grocery store and taping a stranger who can do a good impersonation of John Wayne. 

The teams should be given a specific amount of time in which to complete their assigned tasks and then return to the party location (ideally, a home, in this case). The videos are viewed and the teams vote on the team that did the best. Bonus points are given for the team that creates their own stunts.

Bachelorette party games are not only designed to bring fun to the party, but sometimes to help people get to know one another. This might be a good opportunity for the bride's best friend to get to know the sister of the groom, or for the bride to get close to the groom's cousin or niece. So an icebreaker game isn't a bad idea. 

This isn't perhaps the most intellectual of an icebreaker game, but it will likely break the ice early in the evening before you head out to other events. Play a game called "I never..." and see who takes the most drinks. So the first woman says, "I never..." and completes the sentence. The women who have done the thing the first woman says she's never done take a drink. Then the next woman claims to have "never" done something. 

Some suggestions for this game are: "I never ..." 
*Lied about my age
*Lied about my weight
*Shoplifted
*Got a speeding ticket
*Ran naked through my house
