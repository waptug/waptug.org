Contact Lenses Versus Glasses

As you probably already know, there are quite a few differences between contact lenses and eye glasses.  Glasses have been around a lot longer than contacts, although most people prefer to wear contacts instead of glasses.  Contacts have become popular over the years, proving to be the best alternative to wearing bulky glasses.

When you compare contacts against glasses, there are several things that stick out like a sore thumb.  The first difference in the two is the field of vision.  Glasses offer good front vision, although their peripheral vision is quite poor.  Contact lenses on the other hand offer you a great field of vision, including peripheral.  You won’t be hindered to just looking straight ahead, as contact lenses allow you to look anywhere you want without any problems.

Another major difference is the weight.  Glasses are uncomfortable weight on both your ears and your face.  They also need to be tightened on a frequent basis, along with adjusting.  Contacts on the other hand don’t weigh anything at all.  When you wear contacts you don’t need to worry about tightening them or worry about them constantly sliding your face - which can be very annoying.

Glasses are also known to fog up frequently, and they are very distracting during any kind of sports you play.  Contacts however, don’t fog up.  You can carry out any activity you choose without having to worry about them all. They won’t fall off or slide down your nose when you run, nor will they limit what you can do when you play sports.

Another bad thing about glasses is the fact they need to match what you wear.  If you have casual frames, they may not suit your evening attire.  The colors may also clash, which is a bad thing for those who crave style.  Unlike glasses, contact lenses will compliment everything you wear, for the simple fact that they don’t stick out.

Although there are quite a few differences between the two, they do have a few things in common as well.  Both glasses and contacts require cleaning and careful handling.  You’ll need to spray your glasses and wipe them off a few times each day.  Contacts need to be cleaned as well, before you put them in and soaked in solution when you aren’t using them.  You may also need to use eye drops as well throughout the day when wearing contacts, especially if your eyes start to dry out.

Glasses and contact lenses can both correct astigmatism as well.  If you have astigmatism, you can wear either glasses or contacts.  Astigmatism is an odd cornea shape that impairs vision, common with older people.  Although most people think that only glasses will correct this problem, contacts can fix the problem as well.

The best thing about both contacts and glasses is the fact that they are both affordable.  You can get contacts and glasses at very affordable prices.  Considering the fact that you will probably be wearing them for the rest of your life, they will be the best purchase that you’ll ever make.  Over the years, you’ll get your money back and then some for each day you wear either of them.

No matter which one of the two you decide to go with, you are sure to get the vision you need.  If you aren’t lucky enough to have perfect vision, contact lenses and glasses are the perfect way to correct your vision.  If you’ve been living with not so great vision, contacts and glasses are the ideal way to do the things you love - with perfect vision.
