Over-the-Counter Wart Removal Products

Each year, a large number of individuals undergo wart removal procedures.  Many times that procedure is done right at home. At home wart removal procedures have always been popular, but they seem to keep on increasing in popularity. That is why there is a good chance that you may be thinking about having your warts removed at home.  If this is the case, there is a good chance that you would use an over-the-counter wart remover.  

Over-the-counter wart removers, like any other over-the-counter products, are available for sale at most retail stores. These retail stores include grocery stores, department stores, health and beauty stores, as well as drug stores.  The difference between prescription medications and over-the-counter products or medications is that a prescription is not needed. Essentially, this means that you could walk right into your local drug store and purchase a wart removal product, without ever having to visit your doctor.

In addition to being easy to get, over-the-counter wart removers are popular because they are relatively easy to afford. The cost of an over-the-counter wart remover will all depend on which type of product you purchase. If this is your first time buying an over-the-counter wart remover, you will soon find out that you have a number of different options. Aside from having numerous product manufacturers to choose from, you will also have a number of different wart remover types to choose from. These types typically include medicated bandages or freeze-off formulas.  

Perhaps, the most popular type of wart remover currently available for sale, over-the-counter, is the freeze-off wart removers.  As mentioned above, freeze-off wart removers are made by a number of different product manufacturers.  Since the concepts of these products are just about the same, you will find that, in most cases, the only difference is the price.  Regardless of which type of freeze-off wart remover you choose, you should easily be able to afford the purchase. This is because most freeze-off wart removers sell for around twenty dollars.  

As previously mentioned, in addition to freeze-off wart removers, you can also find wart removal products that use medicated bandages.  These wart removal products are significantly cheaper than the freeze-off wart removal formulas. The cost of medicated wart removal bandages or pads will all depend on how big of a package you wish to purchase. At most retail stores, a standard size box only costs between three and five dollars.  As affordable as these wart removal pads or bandages are, you will find that they take time to effectively work. Unlike many freeze-off wart removers, the medicated pads or bandages do not work right away. In fact, some of these products have been known to take around two weeks or even a month to work.

Despite the fact that many of these wart removers have the same concept, you may find a difference in products. That is why it may be a good idea for you to do a little bit of research first. This research should entail reading online product reviews. A large number of online websites, including online retail stores, allow their customers to rate a product that they have tried in the past.  Since at home wart removal is increasing in popularity, more of these over-the-counter products are being used; therefore, there is a good chance that you should be able to find product reviews online. When examining these reviews, it is not uncommon to find a couple of negative comments, but you need to remember there is a difference between a couple of negative reviews and a bunch of them. 

Whether you make the decision to purchase a freeze-off wart remover, such as the Dr. Scholl’s Freeze Away Wart Remover, or a medicated wart removing pad, such as the Compound W One Step Pads for Feet, you are sure to have your wart or warts removed, maybe even in no time at all. As a reminder, you are advised to review each product or, at least, ask a drug store employee for assistance, before deciding on a particular over-the-counter wart remover.
