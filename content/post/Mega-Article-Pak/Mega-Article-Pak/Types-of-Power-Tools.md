Types of Power Tools

The market is full of wonderful power tools, all designed to help you will any project you wish to under take. It can be tricky trying to decide which power tool you should use for a certain project. However, it is very important that you take the time to find out. You don’t want to damage your project and you don’t want to injury yourself by not using the right power tool.

Drills are used to insert a hole for various reasons. It could be to anchor something by installing nails or screws. Routers are great for carving and engraving. A router can be somewhat intimidating, but once you get comfortable using it, you will find it to be a remarkable power tool. Practice on something before you use one on a project to get a feel for it. 

Saws are a well used power tool. Most anything that is build with wood involves using some type of saw. It can be to cut the beams or to cut corners and holes in the middle of the wood without touching the edges. Saws are also one of the most dangerous power tools out there because of the sharp blades and the shear power they have. Saws are also used to cut down limbs and firewood. 

Routers are one of the neatest power tools, in my opinion. They are great for detail work on trim or to make unique designs. You can create wonderful works of art with a router and some various accessories. The reviews on routers are fairly divided. If you know how to use one properly then you absolutely love it. If you are intimidated by it, then you feel like it is the one power tool you can do without. 

Sanders are very basic power tools, but they can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes you to complete a project. Can you imagine sanding down a vehicle before you paint by hand? There are many different shapes and sizes of sanders to choose from. The are relatively inexpensive. You will need sandpaper or sanding discs for them. The sandpaper comes in different grades from very coarse to very fine. 

A cordless screwdriver is a very simple power tool, but one many of us love using. It sure makes getting screws in and out very simple. Most of them come with a magnetic tip that flips over from a flat head to a Phillips head. This means you only need one tool for all of your screws. I used to be afraid I wasn’t getting the screws tight enough, but I don’t have to work about that with a cordless screwdriver.

With so many great power tools out there to choose from, finding the right one for you and for your projects is going to take some time. Research what each type of power tool has to offer you. The more versatile a power tool is, the more jobs it can take care of for you. That will save you money in the long run because you won’t have to purchase new power tools each time you take on a different project. Read reviews and make sure any power tool you purchase is exactly what you were looking for. Rushing out and making a purchase can leave you very disappointed.
