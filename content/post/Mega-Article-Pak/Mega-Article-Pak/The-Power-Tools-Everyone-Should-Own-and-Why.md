The Power Tools Everyone Should Own and Why

Owning your own power tools is much easier than having to rent them or buy them when a household project comes up. It is much cheaper than hiring someone else to do the work if you are able to do it yourself. Since power tools aren’t cheap, you can reduce the expense and still accomplish most day to day projects at home with these tools. They are versatile and can be used for a variety of jobs.

A power screwdriver may not seem essential, but for those of us who have fought endlessly to get a screw in our out of somewhere in the home, we know all too well what a luxury they can be. It just a few seconds you can get that screw out of the wall or put in anchor screws to hang up picture frames. I keep my power screwdriver fully charged and ready to go. It is the power tool I reach for the most. Since they come with a tip that can be changed from Phillips to a flat head, there is no need to have any other screwdriver around.

A power drill, either with a cord or without, is very versatile. The biggest investment here is going to be on the various drill bits that you will need. The size and the type of drill bits you need depend on the project. You can purchase them individually, but you will get a better deal if you purchase an assortment that are sold in a package. Just make sure you only use the right drill bit for the type of drill you have and for the type of material you are drilling into. 

Saws are the most commonly used of the power tools out there. You should purchase four different types of saws, and you will be set to take on most any project. A miter saw is fairly inexpensive. It works well for cutting angles on the edges of wood and other materials. This is great for getting the perfect fit on the corners on the first try. A jigsaw is great for placing circular cuts and square cut outs. One of the most common uses for a jigsaw is to cut out the power outlet when installing paneling. Most jigsaws are adaptable for a variety of saw blades and are easy to handle.

A circular saw is great for a variety of projects. You need to be very careful with a circular saw as many power tool injuries occur with this particular power tool. Always use a circular saw with a safety guard attached to it. Circular saws cut through most any kind of materials if you use the right saw blades. They can also cut through thick materials. You will also get a very smooth cut with a circular saw.

A table saw is usually an expensive power tool to invest in, but it will be very handy and last for years. It will only take a couple of ties using it to be glad you purchased one. There are many things you can do with a table saw. It is very helpful when you are cutting long pieces of material or heavy materials because you have a table to balance the weight on. It is also great for join pieces and getting a very straight cut. 

These next two items are debated as to their necessity when it comes to power tools. It really depends on your preference and the types of projects you will be doing. A sander that works with or against the grain is something I recommend if you will be doing any type of sanding. This can be on a vehicle, furniture, or a number of other projects. Having a power sander is going to save you hours or even days of sanding by hand, depending on the size of the project. You will also get a nicer finish. Make sure you use the right grade of sandpaper. Start of with a very coarse grade and finish up with a finer grade for a very smooth finish. 

A router is a great tool for detail work. If you will be engraving or doing finishing work, this is the tool you don’t want to be without. There are so many accessories for routers that you can be very creative with your designing. 

While the power tools you purchase are completely up to you, this is a list of the ones that you should have as well as a brief explanation why. With these tools on hand, you will be ready to tackle a variety of household projects that are sure to materialize over the course of time.
