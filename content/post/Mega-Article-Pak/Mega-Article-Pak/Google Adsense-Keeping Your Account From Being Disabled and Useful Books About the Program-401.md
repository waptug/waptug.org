Google Adsense: Keeping Your Account From Being Disabled and Useful Books About the Program

How Can I Make Sure That My Account Will Not Be Disabled?

Google Adsense Program Policies make no allowances for deceptive practices.  The most important thing a publisher can do to ensure the integrity of their site is to be aware of what is happening on your site.

Google has made it abundantly clear not to click on your own ads or ask others to do so.  But what about practices a publisher may not purposely carry out?

Make sure that ads associated with Google never appear in an unrequested pop-up.  Don’t be talked into purchasing traffic for your site that may contain adware.

Respect the Google trademarks.  Don’t use any Google trademarks or logos without their consent.

Don’t change the Adsense code.  If you’re a pro at html, don’t assume you can add your own code.  If you’re new to html, simply copy and paste the offered code. Don’t mess with it.

Provide a good environment for advertisers and a positive user experience.  Don’t try to be deceptive in any way.  Google’s rules may sound strict, but believe me, protecting the integrity of the Google Adsense Program is in your best interest as well as Google’s.  After all, a positive, honest Google Adsense program means more money for all of us.
