Taveuni Palms Fiji

The Taveuni Palms in Fiji is an intimate retreat
offering two private guest houses, a secluded sandy
beach, and even a freshwater swimming pool.  The
island has many spectacular things to offer, such
as scuba diving, kayaking, snorkeling, hiking, and
many other vacation activities.

The Taveuni Island has always been known for its
unique and colorful sea life, tropical fish, and 
amazing varieties of soft and hard coral.  The 
Rainbow Reef, Great White Wall, Purple Wall, and 
Zoo dive sites are all within easy reach of the

The Great White Wall reef offers a tunnel with two
exits, one at 33 feet and another at 88 feet. When
you swim through it, you'll notice a white glow
that is given off by the soft corals that seem
to surround you.

You'll also find two dive centers that are minutes
from Taveuni Palms, which offer you dive equipment
and certified diving instructors.  From beginners 
to expert divers, you can have a lot of fun scuba
diving on your beach vacation.
