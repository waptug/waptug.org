Products For Cleaning Your Contacts

No matter what type of contacts you have, you’ll need to clean them on a regular basis.  Normally, you should clean them at night when you take them out.  If you have night and day contact lenses, you’ll need to take them out on a regular basis and clean them.  There are a few products you can use to clean your contacts, which we will look at below.

1.  Saline 
Saline is a common product for rinsing contacts, most used for storing and rinsing your lenses.  When you take your contacts out at night, you’ll normally put them in saline solution.  Even though it is perfect for storing and rinsing your contacts, it should never be used to clean or disinfect them.

2.  Daily cleaner solution
Daily cleaner is used to clean your contacts.  Simply place a few drops of the cleaner in the center of your hand and then rub the lens gently in the solution.  You should rub the contact around for about 30 seconds, ensuring that you clean both sides.  When you need to rinse and disinfect them, simply use other products that are designed for that purpose.

3.  Multipurpose solution
This is about the best type of solution you can get for your contacts, as it cleans, rinses, disinfects, and stores your lenses.  You can do everything with this type of solution, including soaking your lenses at night.  Once you have finished cleaning your contacts, simply rinse them with this same solution and they will be ready to wear.  With multipurpose solution, you won’t need any other products.

4.  Hydrogen peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide is a solution that cleans, disinfects, stores, and rinses your contacts.  You don’t need to rub your contacts in the solution, simply allow them a few minutes to soak.  Hydrogen peroxide is a no rub solution, and contains chemicals that doesn’t burn your eyes.  Before you put the contact lenses into your eyes, you should always rinse them with another produce first.

5.  Cleaning and disinfecting
As the names imply, this is for both disinfecting and cleaning your contacts.  Cleaning is normally achieved by either ultrasonic waves or agitation, where the disinfecting is done by multipurpose solution or UV light.  The instructions for the brand you selected will be on the bottle, and you should always follow them to avoid damage to your eyes or your contacts.

6.  Enzymatic cleaners
These types of cleaners are ideal for removing protein on your contacts, normally on a weekly basis.  They come in the form of tablets, which you can use with either disinfecting or saline solution to clean the protein from your contacts.

7.  Protein removers
These products come in the form of liquid, and remove the protein from your contact lenses on a daily basis.  They can be used with multipurpose solution as well, as they will get all of the protein buildup off your contacts.  To use daily protein remover products, simply add your normal solution to your case, then add a drop or two of the remover to your solution and put your contacts in.

8.  Eye drops
Eye drops are a common commodity with contact lenses.  They lubricate your eyes, re-wet your contact lenses, and help to give you relief from dryness.  When you choose your eye drops, make sure you select a brand that is safe to use.  This way, you won’t experience any problems when you start using the drops.

There are other products you can use with your contacts, although the above are the most common and the most popular.  You can find these products in your local department store, at great prices as well.  If you wear contacts - you should never be without your cleaning supplies.
