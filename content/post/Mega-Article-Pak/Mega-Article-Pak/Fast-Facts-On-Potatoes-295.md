Fast Facts On Potatoes

Throughout America, potatoes are the most popular
vegetable, even being ahead of other well known
vegetables such as lettuce and onions.  You can
cook potatoes in a variety of ways, and they are 
included in one out of three meals eaten by almost
all Americans.  When they are prepared in a healthy
way, a potato can be an excellent source of energy
and also pack a nutritional punch.

Like oranges, potatoes are very high in vitamin C.
The fact is, one medium potato contains 45% of the
vitamin C that's recommended for good health.  
Potatoes are also high in fiber and carbohydrates
and contain more potassium than a banana.

A potato is naturally low in calories and contains
no fat, sodium, or cholesterol.  The skins of the
potatoes provide a helpful dose of fiber, iron, 
potassium, calcium, zinc, phosphorus, and several
B vitamins.

You can prepare potatoes by boiling them, steaming
them, or even roasting them.  If at all possible,
you should avoid putting potatoes in the refrigerator
or freezing them, as cold will turn the potato 
starch to sugar and cause them to turn dark when
they are cooked.

When you store potatoes, keep them in a cool, dark
place. Too much light will cause them to turn green.
You can store them in the basement if you have 
one, as the basement is the best place to keep
potatoes.

From mashed potatoes to baked potatoes, a potato
is something we all know and love.  They serve 
many different tasty foods, and they provide our
bodies with plenty of healthful benefits.  We all
eat potatoes, some of us even grow our own.  Whether
you grow your on or buy them, the potato is 
the one vegetable that makes everything just a 
little bit better.
