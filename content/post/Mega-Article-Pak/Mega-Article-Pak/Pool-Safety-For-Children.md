Pool Safety For Children

Having a swimming pool on your property can be a great way to have fun for yourself and your entire family.  Even though a pool can be fun, it can also be very dangerous if you have children around.  If you can wait, you should wait until your kids are least 5 or older before you put a pool on your property.  On the other hand, if you already have a swimming pool, there are ways that you can protect your children.

One thing you should always remember is to never, ever, allow your children to be alone near your pool.  Children tend to be drawn near the water, and all it takes is a second for them to fall in the pool.  If you and your children are at your pool and you need to leave the area for a second, you should always take your children with you.  

To be on the safe side, you should always make sure that you have plenty of safety equipment around your pool at all times.  Safety items are great to have around, as they can save the life of a child or anyone else who can’t swim. You should also invest in a shepherd’s hook as well, as you can use it to pull someone out of the water.  Having a phone at your pool is also a wise investment, as you can easily call for help in the event of an emergency.

If you don’t have a fence around your pool you should look into getting one.  A fence is a great way to protect your pool from children.  If you have a protective fence up, you won’t have to worry about little kids falling in while you are away from the pool.  When you put your fence, you should always make sure that it’s at least 6 foot high, with a locking gate.  This way, no one can get into the pool without the key - which you should keep with you at all times.

You can also learn CPR as well.  Even though you may not ever have to use it, it’s always great to know in the event of someone falling in your pool that is unable to swim.  Whenever you have children or people you know can’t swim at your pool, you should always stay within reach of them, so you can react instantly if they fall in.  A second is all it takes to save someone’s life.

Always keep in mind that swimming is fun, although you should always think in terms of safety first.  Once you have finished using your pool for day, make sure that you secure the area well - and lock the gate up tight so no one can get in.
