Becoming A Healthy Eater

Being a healthy eater requires you to become both
educated and smart about what healthy eating 
actually is.  Being food smart isn't about 
learning to calculate grams or fat, or is it 
about studying labels and counting calories.

Healthy eating is all about balanced and moderate
eating, consisting of healthy meals at least 
three times per day.  Healthy eaters eat many
different types of foods, not limiting themselves
to one specific food type or food group.

Eating healthy requires quite a bit of leeway.  You
might eat too much or not enough, consume 
foods that are sometimes more or less nutritious.
However, you should always fuel your body and 
your brain regularly with enough food to keep 
both your mind and body strong and alert.

A healthy eater is a good problem solver.  Healthy
eaters have learned to take care of themselves
and their eating with sound judgement and making
wise decisions.  Healthy eaters are always aware
of what they eat, and know the effect that it 
will have on their bodies.

When someone is unable to take control of their
eating, they are also likely to get out of control
with other aspects of life as well.  They could
end up spending too much, talking too much, even
going to bed later and later.  

You should always remember that restricting food
in any way is always a bad thing.  Healthy eating
is a way of life, something that you can do to
enhance your body or your lifestyle.  If you've
thought about making your life better, healthy
eating is just the place to start.  You'll make
life easier for yourself, those around you, and 
even your family.
