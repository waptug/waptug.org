Hydrogen Boosted Gas Engines

With the ever increasing cost of gasoline prices, 
auto makers are having to work overtime to cost
effictively improve the fuel economy, while still
meeting the strict emission requirements of today
with gasoline engines.

One ideal and promising way to boost the fuel 
economy of gas engines is to add hydrogen to the
fuel/air mixture in the engine.  Since hydrogen
isn't available at the local gas station, selling 
a hydrogen boosted gas engine wasn't on the list
of engines - until now.

Lack of emission
A major cost and environmental advantage to hydrogen
boosted gas engines are low amounts of NOx emission
gas, which will completely eliminate the need for
external NOx emissions control.  Currently, NOx 
emissions control is a major cost problem for diesel
engines which use expensive traps to meet the 
emission standards.  Diesel engines particulate 
emissions that must be collected by a filter that
should be changed periodically.

Hydrogen boosted engines on the other hand require
neither NOx or particulate control and require only
a low cost oxidation catalyst to control very small
amounts of exhaust which is formed mostly during
the engine starting up and warming up.  Additional
cuts in emissions control requirements stem from
the engine's ability to use only the clean hydrogen
enriched charge during the cold start phase when
90% of emissions are generated in the emission test.

Cost
The hydrogen boost system is effectively a bolt
on technology that can be added to an existing
vehicle's engine compartment.  According to those
developing the system, the cost of the system is
less than half of the added cost for diesel.  

The future
Prototype hydrogen boosted engines are now be 
installed in test SUV vehicles that have 
sufficient space for the reformer and it's related
system.  The start of long term road testing
for performance, reliability, and durability
information is planned for later on in the year
before the system goes further into development.

Four cylinder gasoline engines will likely be the
prime candidates for the technology as high gas
prices continue to generate competition among the
higher fuel economy models that seek MPG 
leadership.  

With gas prices getting higher and higher, hydrogen
boosted gas engines offer you the chance to get
more miles per gallon and not have to worry about
burning up all of your fuel.  Instead of having to
go out and buy a diesel to conserve fuel, hydrogen
boosted units will help you preserve gas.

Even though they aren't available to buy right now,
they will be very soon.  Many manufacturers are
looking into them, as they offer gasoline engines
something like never before.  If you own a gas
powered vehicle and have thought of giving it up 
to go diesel, you might want to think again - as
hydrogen boost units may change the world of gas
engines forever.
