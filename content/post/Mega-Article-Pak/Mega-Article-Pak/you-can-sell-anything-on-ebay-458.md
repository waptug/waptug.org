You Can Sell Anything on eBay – Or Can You?

Over 100 million people are members of eBay. 
Through eBay, you can buy items in almost any 
category that you can imagine – at great prices. 
You can also sell almost anything you can 
imagine on eBay – people often sell items that have 
absolutely no real value for very high prices. There 
are limits, however, to what can be bought and sold. 

eBay does not allow certain items to be auctioned 
through their website. Services are one type of ‘item’ 
that cannot be auctioned – simply because it is not 
an item. Some seller’s blatantly ignore this however. 
The sell of other items is illegal, even if it isn’t being 
sold through eBay. eBay restricts the sale of any 
type of item that is considered ‘illegal for sale’ in any 
other selling format. Illegal items such as satellite 
descramblers are forbidden as well.

Anything that is copyrighted - such as copies of 
DVDs, CDs, or software - may not be sold through 
eBay auctions. You can, however, sell a DVD, CD, 
or any software that you bought legitimately…as 
long as you are not just selling a copy that you 
made of these types of items. eBay does not allow 
the sale of ‘replicas.’ A replica is a knockoff version 
of designer items, such as purses, dresses, shoes, 
or sunglasses that look identical to those that have 
designer labels. 

Items that are regulated by the state or federal 
government are forbidden on eBay. These items 
include alcoholic beverages, weapons and firearms, 
all tobacco products, and both prescription and 
illegal drugs. There are small exceptions to this rule, 
however. If you have a collectable, such as a tin that 
contains tobacco, you may sell that item if the 
package has never been opened, and if you state the 
contents of the package are not meant for 
consumption. There are other conditions that must be 
met as well when selling these types of collectables.

Any type or breed of animal or reptile may not be 
sold through an eBay auction. This includes animals 
that were once living, and are now stuffed and 
mounted. This rule may also apply to items that are 
taken from endangered species, such as Ivory. When 
it comes to these types of items, when in doubt, 
don’t.

Tickets may be sold, but it is illegal to sell tickets 
for a higher price than you originally paid for them. 
This is called ticket scalping, and it is illegal. 
Lottery tickets are also banned from eBay 
auctions, as well as raffle tickets. Again, if you are 
not sure if your item is eligible for an eBay auction, 
either don’t put it up for auction, or contact eBay to 
get an answer one way or the other. Don’t risk 
breaking the law!
