Personal Loans for Bad Credit

Personal loans are easy to obtain. They can be used for a variety of financial needs. However, the worse your credit is the harder time you will have getting a personal loan with decent rates. There are two types of personal loans, secured and unsecured. Unsecured personal loans mean no collateral is needed to secure the loan. If you have bad credit, you will only be approved for a secured loan because you are considered high risk. The forms of collateral accepted include vehicles, property, and other tangible items. The collateral has to have a value sufficient to cover the balance due on the loan.

There are many reasons people have bad credit. It can be that they have been reckless with their money and finances. For most people this isn’t the case. Back credit can be the result of a death in the family resulting in loss of income. Layoffs or getting fired from a job often come without warning. Medical emergencies also lead to bad credit as can divorce. Regardless of the reason a person has bad credit; they are still going to need to apply for a personal loan at one point or another.

There are many lenders out there that understand bad credit can happen to good, responsible people. Therefore, they may be willing to give you the chance to prove you will be responsible again and repay the personal loan. You will likely have a high interest rate associated with your personal loan, and that can leave a bitter taste in your mouth. Take it in stride and look at the positive side of things. Getting a personal loan at any interest rate can help you rebuild your credit. Make sure you pay the payments on time. To save on the interest you pay, consider sending extra payments whenever you can.

Be cautious when applying for a personal loan online. There are scam artists out there who prey on those in need of a personal loan, especially if they have bad credit. Never agree to pay any processing fees or other types of payments. It is against the law under the Federal Trade Commission for any lender of personal loan funds to ask for processing fees. Many individuals with bad credit are sucked into these scams because they need the loan so bad. It is important to check out the lender with the Better Business Bureau. If you are suspicious of anything, do not move forward with the loan process. 

Don’t forget to check with the smaller lending companies. Most large lenders are very impersonal and base your eligibility on a computer generated decision. Smaller lending companies are more likely to take the reasons for your bad credit into consideration along with other factors. If you can establish that you are responsible and that you have income sufficient to repay the loan, then this may be the opportunity you have been hoping for. 

Personal loans can be a godsend, especially if you have poor credit. Make sure to take your time before committing to any personal loan offered. Be prepared to provide collateral and to pay a high interest rate as a penalty for your poor credit. Try to view the circumstances as an opportunity rather than as a punishment.
