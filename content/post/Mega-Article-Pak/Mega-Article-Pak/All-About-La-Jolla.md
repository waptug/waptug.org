All About La Jolla

Attracting tourists from all over the world, La
Jolla's community is one that combines trends with
traditional class.  Located 12 miles north from
downtown San Diego, this highly prosperous 
community offers seven miles of coastline at an 
elevation of 110 feet.  The land here is so desired
that it's impossible to find property in La Jolla
for less than 1.25 million an acre!

The lucky 38,000 plus who live in this heavenly 
seaside town live among Mediterranean style
architecture with a unique flair.  From the 
crashing waves along the shore to the high rise
buildings in the business district, you can expect
everything in La Jolla to be first rate quality.

Business district
Even though La Jolla is mostly known for its
incredible shoreline, the city's business district
is hardly modest to say the least.  Located to
the east in La Jolla, there are professional centers,
financial buildings, law firms, and technological
industries that dominate this district.

There are also modern shopping centers here as well,
along with a wealthy residential area.  The 
world renowned Scripps Memorial Hospital & Medical
Research Center is here as well as the San Diego
Mormon Temple - a remarkable 59,000 square foot
building that resembles a large ice sculpture.

The Village
The downtown area of La Jolla offers shops, hotels,
boutiques, restaurants, coffee houses, salons,
and art galleries.  Even though this area is
rather small, the district is full of trendy
establishments that draw wealthy visitors from all
over the world.  

Girad Avenue is the main street of La Jolla, even
though Prospect Drive is known as "Rodeo Drive" in
San Diego.  

Shoreline
Although the business area and La Jolla Village are
both impressive communities, the most memorable
region in La Jolla is the areas and communities 
along the Pacific shoreline.  

La Jolla offers some of the most impressive shore
lines in Southern California, with remarkable
caves, cliffs, beaches, and sunsets.  The best
view of La Jolla can be seen from the air.  Daring
visitors can take in La Jolla via the Torrey Pines
Gliderport and learn flying.  If you seek a more
tame view of the coastline, try the scenic drive
along North Torrey Pines Road.

All along the coastline, La Jolla offers you a
first rate shopping district.  You can visit 
jewelry stores, art galleries, souvenir shops,
and fashionable boutiques.  Once you have been 
shopping, you can complete the day by dining above
the water of the Pacific.

From the art galleries and trendy shops to the 
world class golf courses, La Jolla has attractions
to please tourists from all over the world.  Each
district is unique, yet they are all similiar when
it comes to quality.  You won't find anything short
of the best when you visit the best Southern 
California has to offer.
