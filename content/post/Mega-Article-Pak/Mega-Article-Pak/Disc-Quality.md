Disc Quality

The high demand and dramatic increase in CD media, 
plus the competitive pressures to squeeze out
every possible cost and improve the profit margins
have given rise to many manufacturers of CD related
media.  To help reduce the costs of increasing
capacity, many of these firms have relocated their
old manufacturing lines and hired staff that learn
on the job.

The biggest problems with CDs occurs when discs are
produced using older equipment then end up failing
when you try to use them.  Luckily, most of these
types will fail when you first try to record on
them.  There is however, a likelihood that the disc
will complete a burn and the media won't play at
all.

The agony of taking your photo or video treasures
and putting them on CD or DVD and then deleting them
from your camera or computer only to realize that
the copy is corrupted is far too much to risk.  The
brand name company's such as Verbatim choose to
guard their reputation for quality and durability
by using only advanced recording dye and other
types of technology to produce high speed discs.

The stability of the recording dye is very critical
as heat, humidity, oxygen, and even UV light can
degrade the dye.  Verbatim research has also proven
there is a strong correlation between the production
and bonding processes of disc quality.

For data and personal pictures that are important,
you should always buy quality CD media.  Then, 
before you go ahead and delete the source file,
trying playing the disc back to ensure that it
copied correctly.  This way, you won't have to 
worry about losing your precious files and photos
when you remove the source from your computer.
