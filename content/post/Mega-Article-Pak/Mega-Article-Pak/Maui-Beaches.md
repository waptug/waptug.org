Maui Beaches

The island of Maui is home to some of the most amazing
beaches.  Some beaches offer swimming all year round,
while others are best for surfing or snorkeling
during certain times of the year.  Depending on 
where you choose to stay, there are always some 
famous beaches nearby.

West Maui beaches
If you drive along the west coast of Maui from Lahaina
to Kapalua, you'll see many breathtaking beaches
along the coast.    Kaanapali Beach will offer
you over three miles of white sand with a variety
of watersports, including surfing, sailboating,
and even catamaran rides. On the north end of
the beach is Black Rock, which is well known for
snorkeling.

Visitors like the sandy beach at Napili Bay, 
because there are no high rise buildings around,
and the bay is protected well from waves.  The 
Kapalua Resort in west Maui is home to Kapalua 
Beach, Oneloa Bay Beach, and the D.T. Fleming
Beach.

South Maui Beaches
The rule with Hawaii and Maui is that the further
south you travel, the less crowded the beaches
will be.  

Kihei offers you a series of beaches along the
six mile coastline, some even offering lifeguards,
restrooms, and picnic areas.  Polo Beach and
Wailea Beach offer both restrooms and equipment
rentals.  Or, if you prefer a more secluded beach,
you should visit Maluaka Beach at the Maui 
Prince Hotel - where you may even encounter some
green sea turtles.

A few miles past the Maui Prince Hotel is the 
Big Beach of Makena, which is one of the best
beaches on Maui.  As the name implies, the beach is
quite large, and best of all - empty.  It offers
white sand, picnic facilities, and even restrooms.

East Maui Beaches
The beaches of East Maui are unlike others in
Hawaii.  Surround by lush scenery, the beaches are
secluded, scenic, and very colorful.  

Hamoa Beach is a must visit if you plan to visit
East Maui.  As you approach the beach from the
main road, you'll walk past colorful plants and
palm trees surrounding Hamoa Beach.  Just off Hana
Highway is Hana Bay Beach, which offers black
volcanic sand.

The Red Sand Beach is difficult to get to, you'll
need to find a narrow path along the coast.  The
beach offers plenty of swimming and snorkeling,
and you should be the only one there - which is
great for those looking for privacy.  Even though 
it is hard to get to, Red Sand Beach is truly one
of a kind.
