Entertainment at Disneyland

There is always something to see or do at 
Disneyland, but Disneyland adds to this with nightly 
entertainment during the peak season, and weekend 
entertainment during the off-season. There is also 
special entertainment during special occasions, such 
as the Fourth of July and Christmas. 

Fantasmic is held twice each night during the peak 
season, and on weekends during the off-season. 
The show takes place on Tom Sawyer’s Island, and 
features many characters, music, and fireworks. For 
the best seating possible, purchase tickets for 
Fantasmic in advance, but note that free seating is 
also available, and is included in your Disneyland 
park admission price. 

The Parade of Dreams features large colorful floats 
accompanied by many Characters. This parade 
takes place twice each day. During the parade, the 
entire parade will stop three times to do a 
choreographed show, and most of the Disney 
Characters are portrayed in the Parade of Dreams. 

In the Fantasyland Theater, you can see a musical 
of Snow White. This show is held several times 
throughout the day. This show should not be missed 
– especially if you love Snow White. Since the show 
is held several times each day, reservations are not 
necessary.

These are just a few of the shows that are available 
at Disneyland. Again, entertainment is an ongoing 
thing at the park, with each day bringing something 
new. One thing that you can definitely count on, of 
course, is the fireworks! The fireworks show is held 
late each night – before the park closes for the day. 

Even if you can’t stay for the fireworks, you can 
probably see them out of your hotel window! Try to 
get a view of the Fireworks from in front of Sleeping 
Beauty’s Castle for the greatest effect. The fireworks 
on the Fourth of July are out of this world.

To find out if there are any special shows or events 
during the time that you will be at Disneyland, visit 
the website, call the park, or ask your travel agent to 
find this information out for you. You may also want 
to inquire about special events during specific 
months, so that you can plan your stay at 
Disneyland for those days. 

Most entertainment is provided free of charge, and is 
part of your admission price. However, special 
seating, or priority seating usually requires a fee, as 
well as a reservation. Some events require an 
admission price that is separate from your park 
admission. Again, check the website, call the park, 
or discuss events and fees with your travel agent 
when planning your Disneyland vacation.
