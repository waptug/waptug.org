Exercise And Your Complexion

As we all know and hear all the time, exercise can
do a body good.  It can help you to stay trim, tone
muscles, and help to boost energy as well.  What
you probably don't know, is the fact that exercise
can actually help you achieve the complexion that
you've always wanted.

It's true that regular exercise will nourish the 
skin all over the body with fresh blood, oxygen, and
nutrients.  As well, the increased blood flow and 
circulation that come with working out will help 
to draw toxins out of the body and improve the
condition of all your vital organs, including the
epidermis.

A lot of people think that sweat can trigger acne
flare ups.  The fact is, sweating is great for any
type of congested skin, as it helps promote the 
flushing of impurities from the epidermal layer and
will clean out the pores.  As well, vigorous 
exercise can actually correct the hormonal imbalances
that can trigger blemishes, therefore reducing the
likelihood of outbreaks.

Any physical routine that you like to do, such as
yoga, running, biking, spinning, pilates, boxing,
and such, will help to lessen the stress that you
encounter on a daily basis and help to prevent
stress related acne.

Keep in mind that exercise may not be a miracle
cure for everything, as you may still experience
breakouts from time to time although your acne
will certainly be less severe and last for a much
shorter time frame.

Exercise is also great for other skin conditions 
that may or may not have to do with the presence of
acne. Your skin losing its elasticity or becoming
thin and less resilient is something that we all
encounter.  This is a common problem for may of
us as we get older.

As we all get older, we start to lose collagen,
which will make us look tired.  As many of us 
don't know, physical activity can actually help to
promote the growth of collagen in your skin cells,
which will plump up your facial skin and make
you look younger and more vibrant.

If you are worried about wrinkles, you should 
consider relaxation that comes after you exercise.
This has the effect of making your muscles, facial
muscles included, soften up.  What this means,
is that your lines will appear less pronounced,
helping to contribute to the youthful look that
you are trying to achieve.

With exercise you can achieve a smaller waist,
better muscle tone, softer skin, fewer blemishes,
and an overall younger, more fresher look.  If
you've wanted to add or change to your complexion,
you shouldn't hesitate to exercise.  Exercise
will help you feel more alive as well as improve
your body.  All you need to do is take a little
bit of time out of your schedule to exercise -
its as simple as that.
