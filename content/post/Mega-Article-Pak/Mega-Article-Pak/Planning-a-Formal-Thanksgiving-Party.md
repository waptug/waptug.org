Planning a Formal Thanksgiving Party

Have you recently made the decision to host a formal Thanksgiving party?  If so, have you started planning and preparing for your party?  If not, it may be time to get started. As you likely already know, all parties, regardless of their type, require some planning and preparation, but formal parties often require more planning and preparation.  

One of the many things that you will need to do, when it comes to planning a formal Thanksgiving party, is invite your party guests. Since your party will be formal in nature, it may be a good idea to send out formal party invitations.  These invitations should clearly state the fact that your party is intended to be a formal party. If you wish for your guests to arrive in formal or elegant eveningwear, it is advised that you state so on your invitations.  Since your guests may need to purchase additional clothing, just to attend your party, it is advised that you send out your invitations in advance, a month in advance is an appropriate amount of time.

In addition to invitations, you will also need to decide, ahead of time, which food or drinks you will be serving at your formal Thanksgiving party. In addition to just having on hand snacks, you may also wish to prepare a formal Thanksgiving dinner.  A Thanksgiving dinner is ideal for formal Thanksgiving parties.  Before your party, at least a few weeks before, it is advised that you sit down and prepare a list of foods, snacks, or drinks that you would like served.  It may also be a good idea to start buying these items, especially if you are lucky enough to find them on sale.  

Entertainment is also something that you need to plan and prepare for.  No party is complete without entertainment.  Having light music playing in the background or an area set up as a dance floor is a great way for your guests to socialize during your party.  Elegant music, elegant clothing, and an elegant party setting is the perfect way for you and your party guests to spend your evening celebrating Thanksgiving. At your liking, you can easily incorporate additional forms of entertainment into your formal Thanksgiving party. 

While elegant eveningwear is enough to set a formal Thanksgiving party apart from a casual one, you may be looking for more. That is why it is also advised that you plan, as well as purchase your holiday party decorations in advance.  Online or in your local retail stores, you should easily be able to find a collection of elegant Thanksgiving party decorations, including centerpieces, placemats, candles, and more.  If you make the decision to purchase your Thanksgiving party decorations locally, it is advised that you get decorations as soon as you see them available for sale.  A large number of retail stores are limited on the decorations that they carry; therefore, you will want to make sure that you get yours before they are all gone.  

As previously mentioned, not only are you advised to start planning your Thanksgiving party early, but you are also advised to start preparing for it early, as with buying your Thanksgiving party decorations.  In addition to buying your party supplies early, you may also want to prepare your home for your formal Thanksgiving party. When attending any party, guests expect the party host’s home to be clean and inviting.  With a formal party, your guests will likely expect more. That is why it is advised that you start cleaning and preparing your home weeks or, at the least, in the days before your party is set to take place. Of course, there are some tasks that you may not want to start until right before your party, but it is wise to get a jump start on all of your cleaning.

When it comes to planning a formal Thanksgiving party, as you can easily see, there is a lot of hard work, preparation, and planning that is involved. Despite all of the work, the end result, a successful elegant Thanksgiving party, is almost always worth it.
