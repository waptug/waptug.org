The Dangers of Documenting Illegal Activities with Online Video Websites

While online videos are fun to make and share with others, there are a number of things that you should be concerned about.  One of those things is the use of illegal activities in your online videos.

As previously mentioned, online videos are most commonly hosted on online video websites. Online video websites are websites that allow internet users to view videos or make and upload their own.  In most cases, this is done free of charge. A number of popular online video websites, such as Google Video and YouTube, have restrictions in place. Those restrictions often prohibit the use of certain video material.  While a large number of video sites do have restrictions, not all do.  Even though you may be able to make a movie of whatever you want and post it, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you should.

It is becoming popular to document your “bad,” side online.  There are many individuals, especially high school students and college students, who are trying to impress others. Unfortunately, this often results in the documentation of dangerous or illegal activities.  While you may think that it is harmless to post a small video of you and your friends getting into a fight, vandalizing something, or using drugs or alcohol, there are a number of ramifications, many of which you probably never even thought about.  

When documenting the use of drugs, underage drinking, vandalism, or anything else that is considered illegal, it is important to remember that you are committing a crime.  Most police departments will not scour the internet in search of online photographs or videos, but they may come across your online videos on accident. While you may not be able to be arrested, most officers are actually required to see you in the act, you may raise suspicions. If you enjoy participating in illegal activities, such as underage drinking, there is a good chance that you will continue to participate in them.  With suspicion arose, there is a good chance that you may be being watched by your local authorities.  

In addition to the authorities, if you are student, whether you are a college student or a high school student, there is a good chance that you could be suspended from school. Across the country, there have been numerous reports of school officials finding online content, including videos hosted on online video websites, that document illegal activities. These activities often included underage drinking, drug use, or threats against other students.  In addition to be spoken to by your local police department, there is also the chance of school suspension or suspension for any school related activities, such as sports.

The possibility of being suspended from school and talked to by your local police department are things that could happen right away.  Despite what you may think, your online video could come back to haunt you in a couple of years.  Most online video websites will allow you to remove your video, if and when you choose to do so.  However, it is likely that a large number of individuals have already seen it.  Although they are not supposed, it is also possible that your video has been reproduced and redistributed throughout the internet.  If illegal activities were documented in your online video, there is a good chance that you could be terminated from your job, especially if your video was viewed by your employer.  Also, there are a large number of employers who use the internet to research their new applicants.  Your online video, especially if it documented the use or participation in illegal activities, could prevent you from getting that new job that you always dreamed about.

As much fun as you may think it would be to make a video of your next underage drinking party, you are advised against doing so.  Perhaps, it is best to stay cautious.  You can never tell who will be watching your video and what they will do about it.
