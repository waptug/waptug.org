San Francisco offers Great fun for Kids of All Ages

If you are looking for a great place to visit and bring the kids, look no further than San Francisco, California. This city is a wonderful vacation destination not only for grownups for little ones alike. There is so much to see and do that will appeal to young and old alike.

The real beauty of San Francisco to me is the fact that many of the best attractions for kids are also educational as well. Even better is the fact that the educational values are so cleverly disguised as fun, your kids won't even know what hit them. In fact, mom and dad might find themselves learning a thing or two along the way. You might even find yourselves having just as much fun as your little ones are. 

My suggestion though is to be careful not to overdo it. We all want our kids to have fun and enjoy the vacation experience but if you cram too many activities into a small span of time, you will have children who are overloaded, cranky, and tired. This will make your day miserable and will affect their memories of the time they spend here.  I will give a brief overview of several great things for kids and families to do in San Francisco, hopefully this will help you choose more selectively the activities you feel are can't miss activities and those that you can live without. Also remember if you don't get to do everything this trip, don't try to force activities in. Consider is a good reason to come back.

The first thing that I want to tell you about is the Exploratorium. This is definitely one of those destinations that disguises education as fun. The great thing about this one is that it will not only appeal to the little ones but also offer education and fun for the grown ups as well. If I were to point out one 'must do' thing for your family trip to San Francisco this would be it.

If you're planning to be around Fisherman's Wharf (which I highly recommend) you might find Pier 39 to be an excellent destination. The Magic Carpet Ride is sure to please everyone in the family and the little ones will love the San Francisco Carousel. The Pier 39 Marina offers powerboat and sailboat rides that are sure to please the entire family and the Riptide Arcade will delight the little gamers in the family. Perhaps the biggest attraction though, is the Aquarium of the Bay. This is another activity that I highly recommend. There are many more activities available at Pier 39, you'll just have to check it out and see what you find most appealing to you. I could personally plan a trip to Frisco and never leave the Fisherman's Wharf.

Fairyland is a great destination if you're looking for a relatively inexpensive day of fun. With the admission price for everyone over the age of 1 being 6 dollars, it is a really inexpensive way to spend the day. A day at Fairyland will definitely be a highlight of your trip for younger children and will provide parents and other family members with some fond memories as well.

Another fun thing to do for the entire family is to take a Jelly Belly Factory Tour at the Jelly Belly Candy Company. The tour is free and offered daily between the hours of 9 am and 4pm. While it isn't the height of educational fun, kids will definitely think it's cool to see how these tasty treats are made. 

I saved the best two for last. The San Francisco Zoo and Six Flags Marine World. I cannot say enough about either of these attractions. The magic they hold for children is undeniable and well worth the price of the tickets. The best advice, by far that I can give you about bringing your children to San Francisco, California is to relax and have a good time. Everyone will have a much better vacation experience if you take that advice.
