Disneyland Weddings

Your wedding day is the happiest day of your life. 
Wouldn’t it be wonderful to have the happiest day of 
your life at the happiest place on earth? Of course it 
would – and Disneyland has made that possible with 
Disneyland Weddings.

Women start dreaming of their weddings from the 
time that they are little girl’s. Now, you can really 
have a fairy tale wedding that is truly unique, 
romantic, and enchanting – and you can have your 
very own ‘happily ever after’ wedding day at 
Disneyland. Disneyland weddings include a magical 
ceremony and a creative reception that you can’t 
find any place else on earth. 

You won’t have to stress over the details. Like 
Cinderella, you can have your very own God Mother 
to take care of the details – although in this case, it 
will actually be a fairy God Planner. 

Disneyland weddings are not last minute events. 
The planning stage starts one year before the date 
of the wedding with a meeting with the Disney 
wedding planner, a site tour, and a selection of the 
possible locations for the wedding. Eleven months 
before the big day, the letter of agreement must be 
signed and returned with a deposit. At ten months, 
announcements are mailed out to the guests who 
are to be invited.

Eight months before the big day, the planning steps 
up. Planning sessions are held by phone or in 
person with the wedding planner, and ceremony and 
reception event orders are prepared. Everything starts 
falling into place, and the planning continues until one 
month before the big day. Final payments are due 
thirty days before the wedding date, and the final 
guest count is due four days before the wedding is 
to take place. 

Everything is planned with your input, and all of the 
details are handled without any stress being placed 
on the happy couple. Flowers, invitations, and 
catering are all included. After a ceremony that will l
ive in your memory forever, you and your new spouse 
will enjoy the reception of your dreams. 

The reception will be handled by a white gloved staff, 
complete with elegant resort table settings, a head 
table, floor length linens, and place cards. Your 
wedding cake will be like nothing you could imagine
in your wildest dreams, selected by you from a variety 
of choices. 

There are also honeymoon packages available at all 
of the Disneyland Resorts. From start to finish, your 
Disneyland wedding will have all of your dreams 
coming true, so you and your spouse can start your 
road to happily ever after.
