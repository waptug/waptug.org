Decorating for a New Years Eve Party

Decorating for a New Years Eve party is a very important part of the party planning. A host may spend a great of time worrying about the food and beverages or the guest list but may not give adequate attention to the decorations. This is unfortunate because the decorations at a New Years Eve party can do a great deal to help set the atmosphere for a New Years Eve party. This article will offer some advice on decorating for a New Years Eve party including popular decorating ideas and tips for incorporating themes into the decorations.

One of the most common decorating ideas for a New Years Eve party is to incorporate Christmas or winter decorations into the party decorations. This is considered acceptable because of the proximity of New Years Eve to Christmas. Most people still have their Christmas decorations up and if they plan to host the New Years Eve party in their home it is understandable that the décor for the party will relate to Christmas. Decoration ideas may include a Christmas tree with ornaments, red bows, holly, silver candlesticks and pinecones. An assortment of pinecones in a glass bowl can make a great centerpiece for a New Years Eve party using Christmas decorations. 

Themes for a New Years Eve party do not have to follow any particular guidelines. These parties can be based on any theme which is preferred by the host of the party. However, when a theme is incorporated into the party planning it is expected that the décor for the evening will reflect the theme of the party. For example a New Years Eve party with a beach theme could feature sand sculptures as centerpieces, plates shaped like seashells, a decorative fishing net as a tablecloth or any other related items which may reflect the theme of the party.

Another fun idea for decorating at a New Years Eve party is to ask each guest to bring an item to contribute to the décor for the evening. This results in a rather eclectic assortment of items decorating the party space but it also greatly reduces the amount of time, energy and money the host has to spend on decorations for the party. It also created an opportunity for guests to get to know each other. During the course of the party the guests will have the opportunity to view all of the decorations on display and may wonder about where each item came from and if there is any significance to the item. Later in the evening the guests can each have the opportunity to talk about the item they brought and explain why it is significant to them and why they chose to bring this particular item. This is like an adult version of show and tell. 

Finally in decorating for a New Years Eve party, it is important to ensure the decorations for the party contribute to the atmosphere but do not detract from the party in any way. The guests should notice and appreciate the décor for the evening but the decorations should not be the focal point of the evening. This is important because the focus of the evening should be on the food, the entertainment, the activities and guests socializing with each other and having a good time.
