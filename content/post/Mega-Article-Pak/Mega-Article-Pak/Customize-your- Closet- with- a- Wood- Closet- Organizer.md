Customize your Closet with a Wood Closet Organizer

Make your closet space look beautiful with a wood closet organizer. This is the perfect way to get your closet in order. Not only will you be accessing all that open space, but your closet will look wonderful. Does this sound good to you but you aren’t sure how to get started? There are many options available to you.

The first decision you are going to have to make is the amount of money you are willing to spend on the project. Wood custom closet organization systems are generally more expensive than other types, but they also look nicer and last longer. You can choose from oak, maple, and other types of wood. It is a good idea to work with real wood instead of particle board. The next choose you are going have to make is who is going to be doing the work. 

If you are very handy around the house, then you may be willing to undergo this project completely on your own. You can get it done for the best price this way. It will take some time though to measure your closet and come up with a workable plan. You can also use scrap wood for material to help you save on the cost. You have to be skilled in this area though to do a great job of building a wooden closet organization system from scratch.

If you aren’t skilled enough for that option, you can consider purchasing a kit. These kits are available from many sources including the internet and home improvement stores. Most custom wood closet organization kits come with a variety of hanging rods, drawers, baskets, and shelving. Look for one with minimum installation. Of course, you are going to pay more for that convenience but it is often worth it. 

If you are renting a place, you may not be willing to install a wooden closet organizer kit. That is understandable. However, you can purchase them online from places such as Simple Closets. These wood closet organization systems come with only a few parts that have to be put together and they don’t mount to the walls. 

You can email them a layout of your closet including photos and dimensions. They will then come up with some great plans and layouts for you to review. If you find one that interests you then you can order it and have your closet ready to go with a custom wood organization system that is removable in no time. All of the products sold by Simple Closets are made of quality wood. It is smooth and solid, but unfinished. You can leave it looking natural or stain it to the desired color. You are not obligated to purchase anything if you request free information on layouts for your closet, so what do you have to loose by looking into it? 

The last option is to have a wood closet organization system designed and installed for you. This is done by a professional. Many will come to your home and discuss your options for you. The wooden closet organization system is generally installed within a couple of days. This is a great way to guarantee your closet will look exactly how you want it. 

For the best results, make sure you work with a reputable company who can offer you references as well as pictures of some of the work they have done. Get all information on the installation in writing including the cost, layout, and the time frame for completing the work. You should make sure they offer a warranty and that it is also in writing. 

Investing in a wood closet organization system is a great idea. It will allow you to have an organized closet area that is full of the shelving and storage that you need. No more trouble finding your favorite outfit or both shoes to match your dress! A customized closet with wood materials is a great way to treat yourself to some added appeal in your bedroom.
