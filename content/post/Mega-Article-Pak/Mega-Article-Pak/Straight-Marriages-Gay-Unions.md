Straight Marriages - Gay Unions

The debate of gay marriages has been a very hot political topic for many years and with being such a hot topic it is almost astounding the number of places that have come out publicly either for or against the topic.  While there are few states who allow the idea of a gay or same-sex marriage there are those more liberal affording almost equal rights.  Massachusetts is the only state currently in the United States that allows same-sex marriages.  The state of Rhode Island is generous enough to recognize as legal marriage any same-sex marriage that is performed in Massachusetts, which is a major victory for many same-sex supporters.

The elections of recent years have seen this as a very hot topic button, and with the White House, stressing that marriage involves a man and a woman only, not same-sexes many states have been very reluctant to allow the same-sex marriages. However, a few states have come forward and allowed same-sex civil unions, which are very similar to a marriage. 

These states are California, Hawaii, Maine, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Vermont.  The District of Columbia also recognizes same-sex unions and soon the Governor of New Hampshire has stated publicly that he will sign a bill giving the ok to same-sex unions.  This is a major victory for those who are supporting the movement.  

While many states have not given the green light on the same-sex issue, there are states who are sitting around discussing the issues.  Many couples who are fighting for their rights have argued that there is no difference in the way they run their households compared to their heterosexual counterparts.  They have also stated that while they may be with a partner who is the same sex as them, they do still love their partner and should have the right to get married.  

This has always been a hot topic, and likely will continue to be a hot topic for many years to come.  With the issues raging within the states and at the national level it will likely be a very long time before the gay and lesbian rights groups are able to truly declare a victory for their cause.  Nevertheless, there is some solace to be taken in the small victories as they occur, and another Governor of a state being willing to allow a civil union is at least a step in the direction towards a victory.  

The fact remains that often the views of the individual states tend to reflect the views of the President.  With a President in office who is a staunch opponent to the concept of same-sex marriage as well as civil unions it is unlikely to allow much room for many victories until a more accommodating, or rather liberal, President is in the White House.  

Once the bill passes all of the channels, it can go into effect as early as next year for the New Hampshire residence who have long been awaiting this victory.  With each state that gives this right to its residents, it opens the doors to more states to start becoming more tolerant of all their inhabitants.  Finally, this is paving the way for America to join the bulk of Europe in recognizing the legal inequalities between straight and gay couples nationwide.
