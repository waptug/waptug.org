New Years Eve Party Planning on a Budget

In general New Years Eve party planning is not a difficult process. There are a number of standard elements which are common in any type of party such as invitations, location, food, beverages and entertainment which should be considered but beside from that there aren’t many unique aspects of a New Years Eve party which require special consideration. The late hour of a New Years Eve party is somewhat unusual and results in some unique food option such as offering cocktails and appetizers in the evening and cocktails such as the Bloody Mary and the Mimosa in the morning along with a breakfast buffet. However, New Years Eve party planning does prevent a challenge when it is necessary to complete this planning on a tight budget. This article will provide some tips for planning and executing a memorable New Years Eve party on a tight budget.

The first step in planning a New Years Eve party on a budget is to establish an ultimate budget. Once this is done, you can list all of the individual aspects of the party such as invitations, decorations, location, food, beverages and entertainment and determine the percentage of your total budget you wish to spend on each of these components. 

When planning a New Years Eve party on a budget, it is important to carefully consider the guest list for the party. This is important because the number of the guests you invite may dictate the location of the party. For example if you are planning a relatively small party, you will likely be able to host the home either in your own home or in the home of a friend. However, if you plan to invite a large number of people, you might have to consider holding the party in a restaurant or a catering hall. This is significant when you are on a tight budget because these facilities charge a usage fee and may require you to use their catering services as well which can be costly. For this reason you should consider limiting your guest list to a size which your home can accommodate. 

Food is a very important party of any New Years Eve party. After you have determined the budget for food at the party, you can start to consider your options for providing food for your guests. The most expensive option will likely be to provide a catered sit down dinner for your guests. This option is expensive but many guests enjoy the elegance of this option. If this is important to you, you should consider devoting a large portion of your budget to food. However, there are much less expensive ways to feed your guests at a New Years Eve party. Other popular options include providing appetizers only or putting out a buffet of homemade foods for your guests. Both of these options will be considerably less expensive than providing a sit down dinner with multiple courses. If you are hosting the party in a home, you could even consider making the event a potluck to drastically reduce the cost of food. You could prepare a main course item and ask your guests to bring appetizers, side dishes, salads and desserts. 

There are many affordable options for entertainment when you are planning a New Years Eve party on a budget. Music is one of the most popular options for entertainment at any party but you do not have to incur the expense of hiring a band or a DJ to host the party. Although these can be a lot of fun, you can also provide your own music with a simple CD player and a set of speakers. You can even make the party more fun by asking each guest to bring along a few of their own CDs and have everyone at the party take a turn playing DJ for an hour during the party.
