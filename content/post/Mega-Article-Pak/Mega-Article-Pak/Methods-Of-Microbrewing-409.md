Methods Of Microbrewing

The first thing you'll need to do when brewing is 
to sanitize everything that will come in contact
with your unfermented beer.  It will take time
for the sanitizer to do its job, so don't rush
things.  

Next, you'll need to rinse everything to remove
any remaining sanitizer.  Any remaining sanitizer
can kill of your yeast if you don't rinse things
well.  Add 3 1/2 gallons of water to your 
fermenter then seal it with the fermenter's lid
or a rubber stopper.  This should be done as 
soon as you can before you begin to cook the
wort.

Cooking
Add 2 gallons of cold water to the pot and bring
it to a boil.  Once the water has started to boil,
add your malt syrup or extract kit.  Always watch
your pot boil and never leave it.  Stir it well,
until the extract has dissolved.  

Boiling over can create a mess and cause you to
loose precious ingredients.  Malt doesn't boil
like water, as it comes to a boil the liquid will
expand and foam over the top. Stir constantly 
and keep a close watch to avoid boiling over.

Add a few tablespoons of your boiling wort to 
1 cup of cool water in a santized container,
making sure the temperature isn't too high. 
Next, add your yeast packet and cover the 
container with a saucer or lid.  

Pitching yeast
After the wort has finished boiling, allow the
mixture time to cool to 70 - 80 degrees then
pitch the yeast into your fermenter, which you 
already have filled to 2/3 of the desired
final level with cold water.  

These are the basic steps for brewing your
own microbrews.  You'll also have to siphon,
bottle, then pour your brew.  The final steps
aren't that difficult, although they do
require a certain level of precision.  If 
this is your first time brewing, you should
watch someone experienced first.

With microbrewing, there are many different
methods, including fruit.  Fruit is unlike
other types of microbrews, as the method
introduces fruit into the equation and makes
for a very unique - yet interesting taste.

When brewing your own beers, you can use
any method you prefer.  Some are harder than
others, although a little bit of time is all
you need to become a pro.  Once you have been
brewing for a while, you'll be able to 
brew even the most exotic of microbrews - all
it takes is time and dedication.
