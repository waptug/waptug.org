eBay Sellers:  Tips to Help Your eBay Items Sell

Are you an eBay seller? If you have been looking for a relatively easy way to make money, there is a good chance that you are.  Different individuals use eBay, but many use eBay to make a little bit of extra money or even to financially support themselves and their families.  If you are an eBay seller, how is everything currently going?  Are you making as much money as you had hoped to?  If not, you will want to continue reading on; as some tips are outlined below on how you can help to make sure that your eBay items sell.

When it comes to buying items on eBay, there are many eBay buyers who are the lookout for eBay scams.  Before purchasing an item, one of the first things that an eBay buyer does is check the feedback of the seller.  Doing business with a highly rated and recommended eBay seller reduces or completely eliminates the chances of getting scammed on eBay.  Feedback helps to give you a good reputation, but there is something else that can help you get a good reputation too, an “About Me,” page.  This is a page where you are able to introduce yourself and give a little bit of background information about yourself or your eBay business.  “About Me,” pages are optional, but there are a number of benefits to having one.

Once an eBay buyer has learned that a seller who has an item that they want for sale is a reputable one, they will then continue to examine the product being sold.  This is where your biggest chance of making a sale comes in.  First, you will want to make sure that your products are being sold at a fair price.  Keep in mind, when making your auction listings that you want to make a profit, but you don’t want to scare off any potential buyers with high prices.  Just making sure that your prices are reasonable is enough to increase your chances of making a sale.

Secondly, you will want to make sure that you accurately describe all of your items that are being sold.  For instance, if you are selling a lot or a group of children’s toys, you may want to take the time to list the names of each toy being sold.  Outline the condition that each toy is in as well.  If you are selling toys that require batteries, you may want to state whether or not the batteries are included.  Providing a detailed, accurate description of all of your items will definitely increase the chances of them selling.

In addition to a detailed description, it is also important that you have pictures of your items.  eBay allows you to post one free picture, but more can be posted for additional fees.  Don’t let these additional fees deter you from posting additional pictures, as they are likely to increase the chances of making a sale. In fact, you may want to look into free photo sharing websites, such as PhotoBucket, as they allow you to post additional eBay pictures for free.  When taking pictures of your eBay items, you will want to make sure that you take a number of close-up pictures.  Also, make sure that the pictures are easy to see and that the lighting is good.  Having poor pictures or no pictures at all is one of the many reasons why many eBay items go unsold.

The methods of payment that you accept may also have an important impact on how well your eBay items sell.  One of the most common forms of payments used, to pay for eBay purchases, is PayPal.  The reason why PayPal is so popular is because it enables shoppers to buy items from you, without having to disclose their account numbers.  If you aren’t already accepting PayPal, you will want to look into doing so.  Although most eBay buyers use PayPal, you will also want to remember that not everyone does. For that reason, you may also want to accept other methods of payment, including money orders or personal checks.  The only thing with personal checks is that you may want to wait until the check clears before shipping the buyer their merchandise, especially with large purchases.

By implementing the above mentioned eBay seller tips, you may start seeing an increase in your eBay sales, even right away.  In all honesty, you need to think of it from a seller perspective.  Look at your auction listings; would you buy what you were selling?
