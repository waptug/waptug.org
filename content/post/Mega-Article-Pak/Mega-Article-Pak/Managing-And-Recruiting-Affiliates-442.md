Managing And Recruiting Affiliates

Once affiliates begin to sign up, even if you are
automatically approving them, its in your best 
interest to audit your network on a regular basis.
Now, the FTC is making marketers responsible for
the actions of their affiliates.  If your affiliates
get out of control, it could cost you a lot of money.

You'll have hundreds of affiliates sign up for your
program.  Hobbyists, spammers, webmasters and even
marketers.  It's very important that you review
each one on a regular basis to ensure the way they
are promoting you is acceptable to your company and
above all - its legal.

Below, you'll find some tips when screening:
	1.  All affiliates must have an active web
site.  If not, they may be spammers.
	2.  The affiliate site content must relate 
to your products or services.
	3.  The site should have appropriate levels
of content.  
	4.  Misuse of content.  Be very clear with
your affiliates and what content they can use from
your website.  

Affiliate fraud
Fraud with affiliates has been increasing over the
last several years, which is another great reason
to screen your affiliates on a regular basis.  With
fraud, there are two main types:

Malware - Some affiliates out there have developed
software that is installed on a machine, normally as
part of a free download.  When someone clicks on the
affiliate link, the true affiliate ID is replaced 
with the fraud.  

Fake purchase - If you have a product of high value
that returns large commissions for affiliates, you
may notice some bad parties signing up, then using
stolen or fake credit card information to purchase
products via their links.  

Communicating with affiliates
Good affiliates are normally busy, as they can 
easily forget about your services and products.
As time goes by, your offers can wind up less in
less visited areas or accidentally deleted.

It's extremely important to stay in contact with 
your affiliates, even more so with the high performers.
Do not wait for them to contact you, as if you 
do, it normally means they are reporting a problem.
By taking the time to contact them, you are showing
that you are interested in the partnership.

You don't need a new product as an excuse to 
contact your power affiliates.  Even if it's just
a quick note to ask if they need anything.  You 
can also use the opportunity for feedback on your
program as well.

Managing a successful affiliate program is not an
easy task you can fully automate, as you'll have
to get involved.  Happy affiliates are more 
productive, and the more money they make - the
more money your company makes as well.
