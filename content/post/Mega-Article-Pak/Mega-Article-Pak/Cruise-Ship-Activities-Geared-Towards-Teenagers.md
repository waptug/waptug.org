Cruise Ship Activities Geared Towards Teenagers

When it comes to taking a family vacation, it is often hard to find a vacation destination that targets the whole family.  This becomes even more difficult when teenagers are involved.  If you and your family are interested in having a relaxing, yet exciting vacation, you are encouraged to consider vacationing aboard a cruise ship.

Cruise ships are not what they were in the past.  They have evolved in something spectacular.  Aboard a cruise ship, you are granted access to a number of services, facilities, and activities.  If you are the parent of a teenager, you may be wondering what cruise ship activities will peak their internet.  The activities found aboard a cruise ship will all depend on the cruise line and ship in question. Despite the fact that cruise ship activities vary, there are number of common activities that are targeted towards teenagers. 

Children of all ages, especially teenagers, enjoy swimming and relaxing by the side of a pool.  All vacation cruise ships come equipped with a pool.  These onboard pools are ideal for teenagers.  With a lifeguard on duty, you can feel comfortable allowing your teenager to swim unattended while you enjoy other onboard activities.  Most cruise ships have a standard adult size swimming pool, but additional pool styles may be available.  A limited number of cruise ships have onboard lap pools or wave pools.

Arcade rooms can also be found aboard many cruise ships.  Many arcade rooms are targeted towards younger children, but not all are.  On a number of cruise ships, you may be able to find numerous arcade games that have a focus on teenagers. These games may include, but are not limited to fighting games, air hockey, and other interactive sports games.  Most games found inside a cruise ship arcade require coins or tokens.  If you plan on leaving your teenager unattended, be sure that they have enough money to play the games of their choice.  

In addition to a swimming pool and an arcade room, most popular cruise lines have an onboard movie theater.  At any given point throughout the day, a popular movie could be playing.  Most of the movies shown onboard a cruise ship are designed for adults and teenagers.  If you do not have a restriction on the types of movies that 
your teenager can watch, they can have fun watching a movie in state-of-the-art movie theatres.   

Arcade rooms, movie theatres, and swimming pools are facilities found on most cruise lines. Additional teen activities may be found aboard particular ships.  These activities may include surfing, rock climbing, or ice skating.  To determine whether these additional activities can be found aboard a cruise ship, you are encouraged to examine the cruise ship’s layout.  All facilities and onboard activities should be explained in a diagram or in a printed explanation.

One of the few cruise lines that currently offers onboard ice skating is Royal Caribbean International.  Royal Caribbean’s ship, Adventure of the Seas, has one of the most well-known onboard ice skating rinks.  In addition to enjoying open skating, ice skating shows are offered on a regular basis. These shows can come in the form of a competition or an ice capades show that is geared towards the whole family.  

The popularity of rock climbing walls has increased overtime.  Onboard rock climbing walls are fun for teenagers. Similar activities are often explored in high school gym classes. For a small fee, your teenager could spend the day climbing high in the air.  In addition to the excitement of climbing itself, extra excitement and thrills are added when you realize exactly how high you are above the sea. 

A recent development in cruise ship activities has caused excitement among many teenager travelers.  This activity is known as onboard surfing.  Royal Caribbean recently developed the “Flowrider,” aboard their cruise ship, Freedom of the Seas. The “Flowrider,” simulates surfing waves in a safe and fun environment.  This onboard activity is something that many teenagers would enjoy doing, time and time again. 

The foresaid activities are just a few of the many that target teenagers.  If you want to take a cruise, but are worried that your child will be bored, do not worry.  It is easy to see that most cruise ships have a large number of fun and exciting activities that are geared towards teenagers, just like your own.
