Fabulous Fun for the Little Ones in NYC

If you're looking for great off the wall fun things to do with your children while visiting New York, there are a great many ways to enjoy your visit that you won't read about in most guidebooks. These are things that are a little off the beaten path but a great deal of fun for you and your child. 

Baby Loves Disco is offered in Cielo and Southpaw once a month at each club allows a chance for parents and kids to enjoy a 'night on the town' of disco dancing, bubble making, juice boxing, and having a great time dancing the night away. You'll need to check with the clubs to find out when they are offered and plan to get there early as the popularity of this event is growing and there is generally a long line waiting to get in. Moms and dads love this almost as much as babies and it's a new enough concept that it is not something you'll see in just any large city. It is still a fairly new idea that is beginning to grow around the country.

Jazz-A-Ma-Tazz is a fun jazz show that gets the entire family involved and participating in the making of the music that is played. It is important to remember that jazz music isn't as structured as other forms of music and this makes it much more enjoyable and fun for the kids who participate and you get to watch your little darlings develop a deep appreciation for this wonderful music genre. The tickets for this are $8 at The Bowery Poetry Club. Whether you are hoping to cultivate a serious love of jazz music in your children or simply want to encourage them to explore music and the world around them, this is a great way to spend a part of your New York Vacation with your children.

In addition to these great activities that are a little off the beaten path there are many opportunities for your children to explore the arts by watching the wonderful musicals that are available on Broadway or in the many children's theatres around town as well as through programs that offer performances throughout the year at the many city parks in New York. It is never too early to teach your children to love and respect the arts, as these will be lessons that will last their entire lifetimes. 

It is also a wonderful idea anytime you can get your children involved in activities that get them up and moving around. If the weather outside doesn't invite playtime it might be a good idea to check out the many indoor play areas that New York has to offer just to give them an outlet for their energy and get some much needed exercise that disguises itself as play.

The many parks that can be found in New York City make this a great place to visit for many reasons. One of those reasons, very simply, is the abundance of free entertainment that is available. The parks offer infinite opportunities during nice weather for children to get out, socialize, and exercise. This is something that many other cities around the U.S. would do well to take to heart. Find the activities and events that your child will enjoy most and seize the opportunity to enjoy those moments together.
