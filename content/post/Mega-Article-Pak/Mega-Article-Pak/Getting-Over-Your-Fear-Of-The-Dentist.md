Getting Over Your Fear Of The Dentist

Dental anxiety or fearing the dentist is a problem that many people have, and something that is somewhat difficult to overcome.  This fear normally prevents rational people from visiting the dentist and maintaining the health of their teeth.  The key to keeping your teeth healthy is to prevent problems before they start.  Those who suffer from dental anxiety will try to avoid going to the dentist, which results in problems.

When someone who suffers from dental anxiety finally goes to the dentist, they normally find that even the smallest of problems can turn serious and require a lot of work and intervention from the dentist.  Even though you may not realize it, regular cleaning visits to your dentist is the best way to keep your teeth healthy, and prevent problems such as decay and cavities. 

You can use several techniques to overcome dental anxiety.  Some of the techniques require mild sedatives, also referred to as sedation.  Sedation is a way to relax, given by breathing or IV (Intra Vein) through a vein in your arm.  Sedation will help you to calm down, although you will normally be awake to answer questions or talk to your dentist.

Some people who suffer from dental anxiety have had bad experiences.  Any type of negative dental experience will normally result in emotional scarring and last for years.  Anything that results in negative feelings for the patient will normally cause them to feel in a negative way toward the entire dental profession.  Although all dentists aren’t bad - a negative experience will certainly make a patient feel that way.

When you look fora dentist, you should always ask your family and friends who they use, and who they recommend.  When you visit a dentist, you shouldn’t hesitate to ask him any questions that come to mind, so you can be more relaxed.  You should always keep in mind that you are customer, and the dentist is the one who needs to make you feel relaxed.  Never should you feel intimidated, as the best dentists will do everything they can to establish a sense of trust.

Establishing trust is very important with the patient/dentist relationship.  You’ll be going to your dentist on a frequent basis, so you’ll want to be sure that you can trust him.  When you go to your dentist for the first time, you should let him know about your dental anxiety.  If he isn’t willing to talk about it with you or do things to help you relax, you should look into a new dentist.

You can always tell who the better dentists are by the type of facilities they have.  Dentists who have  a lot of customers or nice offices, have established themselves and proved that they are indeed the best.  If a dentist has a lot of customers, it lets you know that he has them for a reason.  People that are satisfied with a dentist, normally return.  

If you suffer from dental anxiety, you should always let your dentist know in advance.  This way, he work with you to overcome your fear.  Over time, you’ll find that you can overcome your fear and establish a great relationship with your dentist.  You can get over your fear of dentists, no matter how bad your fear may be.  It will take you some time, although your dentist should be willing to work with you.  Before you know it, you’ll be over your fear and more than willing to go to your dentist.
