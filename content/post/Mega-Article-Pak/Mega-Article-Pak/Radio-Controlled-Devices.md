Radio Controlled Devices:

Building, driving, and modifying radio-controlled car kits or other toys is a popular hobby among radio controlled enthusiasts. The radio controlled devices are a popular hobby, and are a key component in a sport that involves displaying the skill of the user in controlling the device efficiently.

Radio Controlled devices, or remote controlled devices as they are also called, are devices that are worked remotely from a distance. The first demonstration of the remote controlling activity was perhaps by Jagdish Chandra Bose when he ignited gun powder and struck a gong from a distance using electromagnetic radiation. 

Tesla was the first to demonstrate a remotely controlled ship calling teleautomata, using transmitter and receiver showing how ships and mechanical gadgets can be controlled on a wireless principle in 1898. He also constructed a wireless tower which remained unfinished due to economic constraints. This showed the farsightedness of Tesla. He laid the foundations for the radio controlled devices that we have today. American inventor Armstrong remarked about Tesla: "The world will long have to wait for a mind equal to Tesla's, a mind of such creative possibilities and such wealth of imagination."

The remote controlled devices are commonly called RC devices - RC stands for Radio Controlled. In 1937 the first radio controlled airplane was flown by Dr. William Good and his twin brother Walter. Dr. William was a specialist in radios and Walter made aeromodels, and they combined them to create the RC plane. Radio control had also been employed in WWII. In the 1960s, the availability of transistors revolutionized the circuits and made them more compact and light.

Principle of the modern RC toys:
In the mid to late 60's, a British company named Mardave, based in Leicester, began to produce the first commercially viable RC Cars. Their first cars were Nitro or gas powered cars sold in the local area in the early 70's. All such devices require a transmitter with controls, a throttle trigger and the wheels for turning. The receiver is placed in the body of the toy.

The models can be electric models as well as fuel models. The electric models work with electrical speed control, and the fuel control systems utilize the radio control mechanisms to regulate the fuel input and the such.

The radio controlled models can be toy grade or hobby grade. The toy grade devices are available in retail shops, and are available at a far lesser price. They are ready made assembled models, and usually utilize electric power. Hobby grade models are available at a greater cost but are more durable and serviceable. They usually require assembly, and most often run on gasoline or nitro.

These radio controlled cars are also used in races, and the cars or toys used in the races should confirm to the specifications. The RC devices can be varied, and include cars, boats, airplanes, helicopters and robotics. The small robots, cars and toys are usually for indoor play. Robotics combined with remote control technology is frequently seen in the international robotics contests held annually in Japan and other countries. Robotics are another hobby, which are even more interesting when combined with radio controlled or remote controlled toys.

The uses for radio control are limitless, and cars only scratch the surface. In reality, there are hundreds of different ways that you can enjoy radio controlled hobbies.
