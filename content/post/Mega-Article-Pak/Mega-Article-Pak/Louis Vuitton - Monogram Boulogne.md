Louis Vuitton - Monogram Boulogne 

The Louis Vuitton Boulogne Purse is from the famed handbag and leathergoods company's 2007 catalog. The Boulogne comes in 4 styles all of which have the same basic design, but feature different fabrics and accents depending on which bag you choose. 

The two largest purses in the Boulogne collection measure 11.8" x 11" x 3.5." The basic designs of the bags are the same, but are very different because of the details. One of the Boulonge purses is black monogrammed Mini Lin cotton and linen canvas. The fabric on this Louis Vuitton Monogrammed Boulogne purse is very elegant and rich. The bag is lightweight and perfect for summer. Brass hardware and black leather strap and corner reinforcements only add to the look and make it a well rounded bag. This particular bag would look great with almost anything and any outing. 

The other Louis Vuitton Monogram Boulogne purse of the same size (11.8" x 11" x 3.5") in this collection is more of the classic Louis Vuitton style. This bag features the notable gold monogrammed LV insignia on rich dark brown leather. This bag is very similar to the above mentioned, but instead of the canvas and linen is made of leather. This style features a light tan leather strap and matching corner reinforcements. The bag also has brass hardware. 

The next bag of the Louis Vuitton Monogram Boulogne purse collection is the Monogram Mulitcolore bag. This bag is smaller than the first two measuring at 12.2" x 10" x 3.9." The bag gives the ever popular Louis Vuitton design an updated look. Instead of the tan and brown color combination this bag features a black background with multicolored LV insignia's. This bag has a very nice outside zippered pocket, which would be great for credit cards or cash on the go. The straps and corner reinforcements are tan calfskin.

The smallest bag of the Louis Vuitton Monogram Boulogne purse collection is the Little Boulogne. This bag is much smaller than the others in the collection at 7.5" x 5.9" x 2" but is very versatile and great for on the go. The LV monogram pattern is featured in black jacquard satin. Black leather strap and reinforcements make the bag very elegant and usable for many occasions. The bag is also the only one of the collection to feature silver hardware, which looks great next to the black on black styling of the bag. 

This collection is very modern and versatile for everyday use or a night out. The little Boulogne could be paired with jeans or with a little black dress. The styles of the larger bags would look perfect for a light lunch and walk in the park with a good friend. This bag is a classically designed Louis Vuitton and could be used for years to come. It is perfect for any age or taste. The Louis Vuitton Monogram Boulogne would also make a great gift. These traditional styles will be a timeless addition to your collection.
