Cleaning Mini Blinds

At some point in time, all of us have come across
mini blinds at the local home improvement center.
They look really nice sitting there, although
no one wants to spend a few days removing the
dust from them.  Regardless of what you may hear
or think, it doesn't always have to be this way.

Detail oriented
It will probably seem obvious, but you should
close the slats prior to dusting.  Weekly blind
dusting is the best way to go, using a lamb's
wool duster, as lamb's wool will naturally attract
dust and can help prevent buildup as well.

If lamb's wool isn't available, a paintbrush 
may also do the trick.  Make sure you place
some towels underneath the blinds to catch any
excess dust.  If you want to be thorough, you
can also take the blinds down and clean them
in your bathtub.  

To remove the grease from the blinds, an all
purpose cleaner can be used.  Spray the blinds
good, then let the cleaner work on them for a
few minutes.  Then, wipe the cleaner off with 
a soft cloth, although rinsing the cloth will
make it even more effective.  To clean the other 
side of the blinds, flip it over and do the same 
thing as mentioned above.  

Fast and simple
This one is simple - simply use an old pair of
cotton gloves to clean your blinds.  Slip the
gloves on, dip your fingers into a solution 
of 1 teaspoon ammonia and 1 quart water, then
run your fingers through the mini blinds.  

If you prefer, you can also use the vaccuum 
cleaner hose attachments.  You can even use
the vaccuum cleaner without having to remove
the blinds. Putting a dryer sheet on the 
blinds will remove any static so that dust
will no longer be attracted to the blinds.
