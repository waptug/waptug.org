The Baby Bedding Challenge

Having a baby is the most wonderful experience a woman can have as it is a fulfillment of the biological function of the female species. After the giving birth process, the real work begins. Feeding bottles, diaper changes, immunization records are just a few of the things the new mom have to learn quickly. And one important thing to consider in the arrival of the baby is the kind of baby bedding he or she will use.  According to Dr. Mark Brandenburg (http://www.baby-place.com/crib_safety.html), the number one rule to follow in choosing the right baby bedding for your precious infant is safety.  The second rule says safety and the third rule emphasizes safety. We are to conclude that it is not enough to say it, it must be emphasized that baby bedding is critical for the comfort of the baby.

In his article on how to find the perfect baby bedding, it must be neither too hard nor too soft. In the past, sudden infant death syndrome or SIDS was attributed to very soft baby bedding. This happened when the baby's mattress is too soft that his nose and mouth gets covered and the air he exhales is the air he breathes. This is dangerous for him since he would breath carbon dioxide rather than oxygen and the effects could lead to drowsiness, coma or even death.

There are a lot of styles and makes in choosing the baby's bed. And with that, it follows that the baby bedding must be a perfect fit with the chosen equipment.  The three major selections are: a bassinet, a crib or a cradle.  What differentiates one from the other? A bassinet is an oblong-shaped basket that serves as a bed for an infant.  But sometimes, round bassinets are also available. A crib is a bed that is flanked with high side bars for a baby or young child's safety. Cribs are usually more economical since the baby can use it from infancy to two years. While a cradle is a small low bed that an infant uses that has rockers on its stand.  In all these, the material used to make the equipment should alert and signal to the mom how much safety precautions are needed.

Bassinets are usually lacey and full of trimmings.  The baby bedding must fit the bassinet so that the baby's space is enough for him or her to be able to roll from side to side. The crib is usually square, thus, mattresses can be fitted to the size of the crib. The baby bedding usually is a set of coverlet and small pillows. Hotdog pillows can also be placed inside. However, the pillows should not be more than two or three lest the baby can stand on them and could fall over. The cradle can come in various sizes and shapes. Some moms prefer cradles so that when the baby is cranky, he or she can be rocked to be calmed down. The baby bedding for a cradle should follow the shape of it.  Not much can be placed inside it since it is used mainly to rock the baby to sleep. However, one need not the three to keep the baby safe, warm and secure. One will do and this would depend on the parent's preference.  The most preferred would be the crib since it can be used for a long time.

Now that we've covered the basic equipment, how do we furnish it with baby bedding? We have already established that the baby bedding should fit the sleeping equipment to avoid accidents and other untoward incidents.  The most suitable material to use is cotton as it is absorbent and cool to the baby's skin. Different designs must be used to stimulate the baby's color and pattern recognition.  Therefore, the baby bedding is a crucial factor in keeping the baby happy and healthy.
