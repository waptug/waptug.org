Special Hummel Figurines

I find old Hummel figurines at art auctions all the time.  I’ve been collecting them for my mother and her sister for a long time.  They don’t have the time to go to art auctions, but they have the money to buy nice figurines.

The Apple Tree Boy Hummel figurine I found for my aunt last year was so cute.  I attended an art auction about an hour away from my house and they had lots of decorative collectibles.  I was able to find several items for my mother and also for my father.

My mother and her sister both want to have an Umbrella Boy Hummel figurine.  I have only been able to find one at all of the art auctions I’ve attended.  They share the piece equally while I’m looking for a second piece.

The whimsical Hummel figurine called Pleasant Journey is so cute.  It was the first Hummel that mother and my aunt ever received.  The scene is of two children pulling a third child in a wagon.  My grandmother found it at an art auction and it reminded her of her children.  She gave it to her two daughters on their shared birthday.

My dad sings in a barbershop quartet.  My mother asked me to find an appropriate Hummel figurine at one of the art auctions I attend to give to him for his birthday.  I actually was unable to find just the right item for over a year.

My mother was thrilled when I found the Harmony in Four Parts Hummel figurine at an art auction in our hometown.  She presented it to him on his birthday and he really liked it.  I think she may have liked it more, but that is okay with him.  He has always been very supportive of my mother’s collecting.

My mother gave my son a Hummel figurine when he graduated from high school.  I thought it was an odd gift to give a kid that had never expressed any interest in collecting them.  She did choose a nice piece from her collection that I had purchased for her several years ago at an art auction.  She gave him the Hummel figurine Little Fiddler because he plays the violin.

When my aunt went on a cruise, I decided to find her a nautical Hummel figurine.  I had to attend four art auctions before I found one.  I ended up purchasing the Hummel figurine called Land in Sight.  She loved it.

Hummel figurine Let’s Tell The World was a special piece.  It is really pretty and it depicts three children ringing a bell.  My cousin has been going with me to art auctions looking for it.  She thinks that we need to give it to our mothers to share like they do the Umbrella Boy.

I don’t usually collect Hummel figurines.  I leave that to my mother and my aunt.  The only exception to this is the “Can I Play?” Hummel figurine.  I found it at an art auction and it reminded me of playing at my grandmother’s house when I was a child with my brother and my cousin.

The most expensive Hummel figurine that I’ve found at an art auction in the last couple of years was a vintage piece called School Girls.  I got into a bidding frenzy with another collector and ended up spending a thousand dollars.  The piece was celebrated with a party at my aunt’s house.
