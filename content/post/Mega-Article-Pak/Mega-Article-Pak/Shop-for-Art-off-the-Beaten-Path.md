Shop for Art off the Beaten Path

Art is one of many cultural draws in New York City. There are art galleries in abundance in this great city and almost certainly an artist to fit almost any taste. Art has always been to some degree in the eyes of the beholder and beauty in the city of New York is in abundant supply.

Whether you consider yourself an enthusiastic supporter of art and the arts, it's hard to deny the fact that New York has a great deal of art to offer those who are willing to seek it. From the graffiti that is so artfully rendered along bridges, buildings, busses, and signs throughout the city to murals and store windows that are so wonderfully made art comes in this city in many forms. You will find artists, sketchers, painters, and those seeking muses wandering around various parts of the city that may be particularly lovely, inspiring, or even forlorn. 

The art doesn't end with sketches, drawings, or paintings. It goes well beyond that. In this great city you will see sculptors with magnificent works that might be inspiring to you and might be utterly and completely unintelligible and you might find art that touches your heart and simply won't let go. For whatever reason, art for most of us is purely emotional. This isn't only true for the painter but also for those who witness the beauty of the art that has been created.

There is also pottery, blown glass, metal works, wood works, and literally dozens of other works of art within this city. You can stroll through the many galleries of the city or walk along the streets and through the parks seeking art and the artists that create these wonderful works. You might find the grandest work of art in the hands of the slightest of creatures or in the most unlikely of places. New York is full of surprises that go far beyond the beaten paths.

If you are truly seeking art to bring home from your trip to New York, the best place to look is in second hand or consignment shops. You can generally find nice pieces of art at unbelievably low prices. This is one of the best ways to begin building your collection and there are some second hand shops that specialize in artwork or 'junk art'. Of course there are galleries that deal with rare second hand art and it is highly unlikely that you'll find a discount there. Stick to the consignment shops, flea markets and used furniture stores if you are truly seeking some nice pieces that are seriously undervalued.

Keep in mind that the art you choose only needs to speak to you (and hopefully match your décor to some degree, unless of course you are searching for an excuse to redecorate) and doesn't have to really mean anything at all. When you do find a piece of art that you feel you must own, price is often not a consideration. This makes the fact that you're looking in a second hand store a much better way to shop. At least in this instance you won't have to deal with sticker shock from the massively over inflated price tags you will find in most galleries. Of course that is because they are recovering their commissions off the top so you're automatically knocking off that much of a discount by shopping second hand and off the beaten path.
