Supercross Motorcycle Racing: How the Tracks Are Made

Supercross motorcycle racing is a popular sport that has taken the racing world by storm.  It almost seems as if the sport generated a fan following overnight. As supercross motorcycle racing started becoming more publicized, especially when races were broadcasted on television, that following continued to increase.  Unlike many other sports, supercross motorcycle racing fans not only want to watch the races, on television or in person, but they also want to learn as much as they can about the sport.  

When it comes to learning about supercross motorcycle racings.  There are many fans who wish to learn more about the rules, others who want to learn more about their favorite riders, and other who want to learn more about the racing surface. If you are looking to learn more about supercross motorcycle racing tracks and surfaces, you are in for some excitement. This is because a supercross motorcycle racing track can not just be thrown together by anyone at anytime. There is a lot of art, design, and hard work that goes into making the perfect supercross racing track.  It is almost guaranteed that you will not only find this process exciting to learn about, but interesting as well.

Before you can begin to understand the process of making a man-made supercross motorcycle track, it is important to remember one thing. There are different variations of the sport.  These variations include professional races and amateur races.  Amateur racers are individuals who tend to race for the passion of the sport, often at a local track.  While professional supercross racers will also race for the love of the sport, they are also doing so for income.  Once at the professional level, many successful supercross racers are more then able to financial support themselves or their families.  Since each of these supercross variations have unique purposes and goals, their tracks tend to be made a little bit differently.

With professional supercross motorcycle racing, a professional company is often called in to make the track.  Supercross race tracks are commonly referred to as off-road courses.  This means that they are often made of dirt.  In addition to being made of dirt, supercross race tracks are also like obstacle courses.  They tend to have numerous corners, many of which can be considered sharp, as well as jumps.  While you would assume that it would be easy enough to throw dirt onto a surface and make a few jumps, the reality is that it isn’t as easy as it actually seems.  A lot of hard work goes into making a supercross race track, especially a professional one.

The first part of building a supercross race track is to get the needed supplies. As previously mentioned, most tracks are made of dirt.  Professional supercross track developers receive most of their dirt for free or at a discounted price.  The same can be said for local, amateur courses.  You will find that many individuals and companies are more than willing to give away extra dirt that they have on their land or leftover from a previous building project.  Although it is fairly easy to obtain the dirt, many have a problem getting it delivered.  The cost of delivery tends to be fairly expensive.

Once the dirt has been delivered, whether to a professional racing venue or an amateur one, the dirt will have to be sorted out.  This process will be used to eliminate any unwanted or dangerous debris, including rocks.  Once all of the dirt has been sorted out, it will be molded.  This molded dirt is than use to create the racing surface. As previously mentioned, this racing surface often includes high jumps and numerous turns. In addition to high jumps, smaller jumps, often referred to as hills, are used.  These help to keep the racing exciting for fans, but competitive for racers.  

After the race has ended, the track may need to be cleaned up.  Most amateur race tracks are left for a specific period of time. This is often because many amateur tracks are often locally run and operated; therefore, they do not always need to removed. However, since professional supercross racers will move onto the next event, their tracks need to be cleaned up. In a way, the cleanup process is just has hard as making the track in the first place.  It may take over ten hours, sometimes even up to a whole day, to remove.
