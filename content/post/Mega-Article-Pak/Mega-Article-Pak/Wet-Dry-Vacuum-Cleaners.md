Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaners

The wet/dry vacuum cleaner combination is no longer
just for a workshop.  Over the years, the driving
technology has improved a great deal, deceasing
the loud screeching noises that the vacuums were
so very well known for.

When you go out to buy a wet/dry vacuum with both
wet and dry features, you'll need to know some of
the details.  The vacuums are available in a variety
of different sizes and HP, ranging from 6 - 22 gallons
and 1.5 - 10.5 HP.  The capacity of the wet/dry 
vacuum should match your needs in the following 
ways:
	1.  Wall mount vacuum cleaners with 1.5 HP
and a 1 gallon tank are available for quick and easy
cleanup jobs, such as spills.  You can also hang 
this type on the wall as well, which will keep it out
of your way.
	2.  The six gallon vacuum cleaners are ideal
for smaller jobs and are easy to maneuver and store
than a larger model.  Keep in mind however, that the
smaller wet/dry cleaners are much louder and also
more prone to tipping over.  The smaller the tank,
the more often you will have to stop and empty it.
	3.  Higher capacity models are recommended 
if you have a workshop or garage where larger spills
occur.  A large capacity tank will decrease the number
of times that you have to empty the tank.

When you looking for the best wet/dry vacuum for
you, you should look for the following options and
features:	
	-  The pleated cartridge filter.  It is 
reusable and rinseable, and provides more filtration
area than the flat filter and it doesn't need to
be removed when you switch from the dry to wet
vacuum function.
	-  An automatic shut off device is available
with most newer vacuum cleaners.  This mechanism 
will shut off the motor automatically once the 
tank has become full of water, which will prevent
it from overflowing.
	-  A wide set of wheels will help to prevent
the vacuum from tipping over.
	-  There are some of the larger models that
have the ability to convert to a leaf blower, which
is great if you have a lot of trees in your yard.
	-  Some wet/dry models have a built in pump
attachment as well.  This type of attachment will
allow the water to be pumped through a garden hose
that attaches to the vacuum.
	-  A handy drain valve or sprout will make
emptying the vacuum cleaner a snap.  If it doesn't
have this feature, you'll have to remove the
lid and tip the vacuum to the side to empty all of
the water.  Depending on how much water you have
in the tank, you could easily and accidentally
spill it on the floor.  The smaller types of wet/dry
vacuums normally don't have a spout or drain 
option.
	-  Wider hoses and floor nozzles are great
to have as well.  The wider the hose and nozzle
are, the less likely the vacuum will be to clog up
on you.

If they aren't provided with the vacuum you decided
on, you can also purchase the following attachments:
	1.  Crevice tool - this handy tool will
easily get in tight corners and around floor edges.
	2.  Extension wand - this will make the hose
longer for hard to reach areas.
	3.  Hose couplings - this will join the
extension wand to the hose.
	4.  Combination nozzle - this helps to
alleviate the need of switching nozzles before you
switch functions.
	5.  Gulper nozzle - this tool is ideal for
the wet vacuum function.
	6.  Round brush - this nifty little tool
is ideal for scrubbing.
	7.  Cleaning kit - this kit will include
everything you need to clean delicate upholstery and
other areas as well.
