The Many Novelty Accessories Available To Golfers

Golf is a sport in which the players can almost constantly find something new to spend their money on. The clubs alone can cost insane amounts in order to get the nicest graphite ones. If you are going to spend all of your money on the nicest graphite clubs that you can find, you may miss on some really interesting and eccentric accessories. There is always something new and clever that a golfer can buy, and you will sometimes see people driving their golf carts around loaded with tons of novelty golf accessories. If you want to get involved in this wild and crazy world, read on to find out about some of the most useless (and hilarious) golf accessories that you can find.

Have you ever hit a hole in one? This sort of event is something that does not soon leave a golfer’s mind, and the Hole-N-One plaque is not going to speed it up. This plaque is sold online and in some golf stores, and comes with the plaque itself and the kit to quickly fasten a golf ball to it. The goal is to proudly display the ball that you used to hit the hole in one for everyone to see. Instead of putting the ball to good use and playing more games of golf with it, you can immortalize it on your wall. Many would say that this is frivolous and unneeded, but if you feel as though you need to save the ball then at least you know there is an accessory out there for you.

One clever internet site offers something called the Tee-Card. It is a small product the size of a business card, and it pops out to form a golf tee that can be used as many times as you want. This is a golf accessory that could actually come in handy in the unlikely event that you lose your golf bag and have nothing but your wallet (which quite conveniently holds a Tee-Card). It is unclear whether this product works on grass or not, but it seems hard to imagine how a product like that could function in grass. It’s hard to imagine who this accessory could be intended for, but it sure seems like a novel idea.

Another interesting novelty accessory is the “WOW” putter, which is equipped with so many gadgets it would make James Bond jealous. Supposedly the gadgets are supposed to aid the golfer in making a better putt, but you may have trouble imagining how they could all come in handy. The head of the putter includes a tape measure, a compass, a level, a rabbit foot, and a horn. Surprisingly, the putter is fairly usable despite all of the attachments. If you think that you could actually use a tape measure or a compass or a level during your putting, then this could be the perfect putter that has eluded you for so long.

For more extravagant and seemingly unnecessary golf accessories, you can buy all sorts of personalized golf clubs and accessories. One company offers a putter plated in 24k gold, personalized with whatever message the buyer chooses. This is a great way to show off to all of your golfing friends, and let them see what a nice putter you have. Unfortunately, the price can run fairly high for the gold plated versions. If you really want your golf accessories to be plated in gold you will be paying a fair price for it. You will have to decide for yourself whether it is worth it or not.

As you can see, there are countless pointless accessories for the game of golf. You can show off all of your accomplishments in an extravagant way, or you can bring all sorts of gadgets with you onto the golf course. No matter what you do, you’re sure to get a few laughs with your golf accessories.
