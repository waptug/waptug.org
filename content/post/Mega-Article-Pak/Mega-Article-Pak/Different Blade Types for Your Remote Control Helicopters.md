Different Blade Types for Your Remote Control Helicopters

As a world renowned helicopter flyer with tons of medals, plaques, and rewards, I know a lot about blades on remote control helicopters, and the problems that they can sometimes cause.  Apparently, like the man who left a good review for a company that he didn’t really know enough about to write an educated review, there are also stories about people who left poor reviews and the product was actually quite good, and then they were never asked to write a review for any company ever again, and this cost them money as well.

So the moral of the story is, always make sure that your reviews are well researched and that you don’t put your name on anything unless you really trust that it is a quality product, but at the same time, it’s very easy to just write poorly about something, but you should also avoid that if you ever want to be sanctioned for another review again.  As far as the remote control helicopter blades go, I was very lucky to take part in a detailed remote control helicopter blade testing session, so I could see what are important things to check when you’re looking into purchasing another remote control helicopter for your collection, and especially when you’re getting ready to purchase your very first remote control helicopter.

Essentially, the blades are very important.  They need to be durable, in case you are not a very good flyer, because it is the blades that will often run into things and become damaged.  At the same time, you don’t want the blades to be too sharp, because you don’t want them to damage any of your other things, especially if you’re flying the helicopter in your home (which I try to discourage in every situation, but people still do it).  So all in all, you’re best off going with a helicopter that has strong metal or plastic blades—although the plastic blades tend to be lighter, so they are sometimes the better bet, but the metal blades tend to be more durable, so it’s really anyone’s guess.  And you also want to look for blades that are rounded at the edges.  This is no only good because rounded edges are more aerodynamic, it’s also good because you can protect yourself and your loved ones from cutting themselves on the helicopter blades when they are, for instance, taking a helicopter down from a high shelf.

I know of a friend who had a helicopter on a high shelf, and she didn’t know to get rounded blades, and when she reached to take it down, she dropped it, and actually cut her hands pretty badly.  She didn’t need stitches, but it was still a scary incident for her that she could have avoided by just getting a helicopter with rounded edges.  In other cases, I hear about people that got metal blades on their helicopters, and the rest of the helicopter wasn’t built powerfully enough to support the heavy metal blades, and these helicopters never fly properly.
