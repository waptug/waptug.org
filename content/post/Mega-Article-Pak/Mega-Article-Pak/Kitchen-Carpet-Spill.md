Kitchen Carpet Spill

A spill on the kitchen carpet can be anything from
a child's cup falling off the table to muddy footprints
around the room.  Properly dealing with the kitchen
spill is what seperates the professionals from everyone
else.

With a little bit of common knowledge, many of the 
spills that occur can be cleaned up and corrected fast
and easily.  Knowing how to react to spills in the 
kitchen are what makes things easier than ever.

The first thing to do, is use a bit of common sense.
Its important for you to take very quick action and
be smart about the first steps you take in cleaning
up your kitchen carpet spill.  To put it in other
terms - don't let the spill sit.

The longer the spill or product sits on your carpet,
the deeper in it will go.  A larger spill that has
time to seep into the carpet and into the padding 
and reaches the floor boards is one type of spill 
that will need extensive cleaning.  Therefore, you'll
need to move quickly and effectively.

You can take different steps to remove spills from
your kitchen carpet.  One thing that remains the 
same throughout every spill you encounter is that
you shouldn't rub them.  Most often, rubbing the 
spill will rub them into the fibers of the carpet.
This will make them less likely to come off.  Instead
of rubbing, you should consider blotting.  Blotting
puts small amounts of pressure on the stain to
allow the cloth or paper towels to soak it up.  This
doesn't work the stain deeper into the carpet.

As far as getting the spill out of the carpet, you
can use several methods.  First, you should try 
and remove as much debris from the floor as possible,
wiping as much as you can up.  Then, there are
several routes that you can take.

If you own a carpet cleaner, this will be your
best option.  Last, there are several products on
the market that you can use.  This will help when
it comes to difficult spills.  Unless you have
them on hand, waiting isn't an option.  Spills in
the kitchen needs to be handled in a quick and
timely manner.

Since the kitchen spill happens in one of the most
used rooms of the home, you'll need to make sure
that you do a great job in cleaning it up.  Because
spills can happen frequently, it is important 
that you do a complete cleaning of the carpet on
a regular basis.

Even though kitchen carpet spills are nearly 
impossible to prevent, you can protect yourself and
your carpet by knowing what to do.  If you keep
your carpet clean, you'll have no problems cleaning
up spills as they occur.
