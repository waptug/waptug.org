Breast Feeding And Positioning

For some people, the process of breast feeding 
seems to come natural, although there's a level 
of skill required for successful feeding and a 
correct technique to use.  Incorrect positioning
is one of the biggest reasons for unsuccessful
feeding and it can even injure the nipple or 
breast quite easily.

By stroking the baby's cheek with the nipple, the
baby will open its mouth towards the nipple, which
should then be pushed in so that the baby will 
get a mouthful of nipple and areola.  This 
position is known as latching on.  A lot of women
prefer to wear a nursing bra to allow easier access
to the breast than other normal bras.

The length of feeding time will vary.  Regardless
of the duration of feeding time, it's important 
for mothers to be comfortable. The following are
positions you can use:
	1.  Upright - The sitting position where 
the back is straight.
	2.  Mobile - Mobile is where the mother
carries her baby in a sling or carrier while breast
feeding.  Doing this allows the mother to breast 
feed in the work of everyday life.
	3.  Lying down - This is good for night feeds
or for those who have had a caesarean section.
	4.  On her back - The mother is sitting 
slightly upright, also a useful position for tandem
breast feeding.
	5.  On her side - The mother and baby both
lie on their sides.
	6.  Hands and knees - In this feeding position
the mother is on all fours with the baby underneath
her.  Keep in mind, this position isn't normally
recommended.

Anytime you don't feel comfortable with a feeding 
position, always stop and switch to a different
position.  Each position is different, while some
mothers prefer one position, other's may like a 
totally different position.  All you need to do is
experiment and see which position is best for you.
