Search Engine Relationships To Marketing

The landscape of search engines have went through
some drastic changes over the years.  Not only with
technology, but also with various partnerships
between the many different search companies as well.

You might be running your search engine queries on
a particular search engine, although who is actually
supplying the results - it could be a different
company altogether.

Below, is a list of the search engines that feed your
precious keywords:

Yahoo
Yahoo provides the primary search results for Yahoo
search, Alta Vista, and AllTheWeb, and receives paid
listings from Yahoo Search Marketing (formerly known
as Overture).

Google
Google provides the primary search engine results
to Google AOL Search and also Netscape.  Google also
supplies paid listings to Lycos, Ask, Netscape, AOL
Search, and HotBot.  It also supplies secondary 
results to HotBot and receives it's directory data
from DMOZ.

Lycos
Lycos receives the directory search results from
DMOZ, primary results from Ask, and paid listings
from Google Adwords.

Hotbot
Hotbot receives directory search results from DMOZ,
primary search results from Ask, and paid/secondary
results from Google Adwords.

Ask
Ask provides primary results to Ask, Hotbot, and 
Lycos.  It receives secondary search results from
Teoma and the directory results from DMOZ, with
paid listings from Google Adwords.

In relations to marketing, search engines can 
provide anything you want to know.  If someone is
looking for something, they normally refer to the
search engines.  When they type it in, the highest
sites on the engines will show - which is normally
where the visitor will go.

By keeping good position on the search engines, 
you'll be near the first for visitors who are looking
for a certain product.  You can make a lot of money
with search engines as well, if you know what you
are doing.
