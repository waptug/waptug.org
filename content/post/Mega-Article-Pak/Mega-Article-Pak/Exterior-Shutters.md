Exterior Shutters

Installing exterior shutters to a window is a quick 
and easy way to add style and flair to the outside
of a home.  Both historical and modern houses will
benefit from the timeless accent of having exterior
shutters.  As with all types of home improvements,
the quality and longevity of the exterior shutters
should be evaluated before you make a purchase.

The exterior window shutters for your home are
available in many different shapes and materials.
Vinyl or wood shutters are easily available at most
home improvement stores, and they can also be a 
cost effective option.  You can also make wooden
shutters operable with functional hardware.

Exterior shutters can also be made out of several
types of wood.  The best wod to use is cedar, as
it offers outstanding durablity and resistance to
decay.  Cedar also provides long service with minimal
maintenance in applications involving mud, silk,
window sahes, fencing, poles, and even exterior
shutters.  

The tannin oil in ceder is what really makes it an
ideal wood for exterior shutters.  It will prevent
moisture penetration - and bugs hate it.  Keep in
mind, exterior shutters shouldn't be left unprotected.
It is however, best to finish the shutters before
you install them, so that all surfaces can be 
fully covered.  

The ideal base for exterior shutters is a primer
coat of oil base primer that is tinted as close to
the final color as possible.  The oil will penetrate
into the wood, giving better protection.  For the
best results in painting, you should always consult
a professional painting company.

You can mount exterior shutters to your home with 
a 1/2" spacer between the back of the panels and
the building to allow ventilation.  If you aren't
using functional hardware, you should use rust proof
screws that sink flush to the wood.  Once you
have finished the installation, simply paint over
the heads of the screws.

By having on opaque finish painted on the wood, it
will prevent light rays from penetrating the finish
and breaking down wooden fibers of your exterior
shutters.  If you choose, you can also stain
exterior shutters.  

Anytime you are staining shutters, you should use
finishing products that are designed specifically
for exterior use, and be prepared to do proper 
maintence on your shutters to keep them looking good
all the time.

Exterior shutters will add color and style to the
outside of your home, making them a purchase you
can't go wrong with.  Wooden exterior shutters are
the most popular and best to use - making them
something you truly must have for your home.
