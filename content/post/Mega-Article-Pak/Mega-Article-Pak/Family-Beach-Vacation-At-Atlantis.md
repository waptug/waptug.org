Family Beach Vacation At Atlantis

Located on Paradise Island in the Bahamas, the 
Atlantis Paradise Island offers so many activities
that it's probably one of the only resorts in the 
world where you'll need a map to even get around!

The accommodations here range from moderately
priced to very expensive.  Families on vacation
here should consider staying in the Coral Towers,
which is the most centrally located tower at
Atlantis.  The Coral Towers is also closest to the
Predator Lagoon and the Lagoon Pool as well.

Atlantis Paradise Island Resort is also packed with
activities for guests of all ages.  The eleven
pool areas, miles of sandy beach, and Neptune's
Water Toys Hut give guests access to many water 
based activities.  Neptune's provides non motorized
water sports which include water bikes, pedal 
boats, kayaks, and even snorkeling equipment rentals.

Parents will adore
Atlantis has two different programs for children,
the Aqua Tots program and the Discovery Channel Camp.
The Aqua Tots program was designed for children 3
years old and up, while the discovery camp is for
kids 4 - 12 years old and ranges from a 1 hour 
program to one that includes lunch and even dinner.

Kids love
All kids love the six different water slides and
the marine exhibits.  This can keep kids busy for 
hours and hours, and are pretty fun for the parents
as well.  In order to enjoy the slides, kids must be
at least 48 inches tall.

A beach vacation at Atlantis is something your
entire family will love.  There is something here
to keep everyone occupied, from the beaches to fun
on the slides.  If your family enjoys the best of fun
and the beach, Atlantis is something your whole 
family will enjoy - and love coming back to.
