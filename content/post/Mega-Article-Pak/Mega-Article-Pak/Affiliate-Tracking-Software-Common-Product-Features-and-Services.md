Affiliate Tracking Software:  Common Product Features and Services

If you are interested in starting your own affiliate problem, you are not alone.  Each day, a large number of business owners make the decision to do just that. To make your affiliate program a success, you will need to decide on an affiliate tracking software program.  

Affiliate tracking software is used to track your affiliates, if you are business owner.  Affiliates are the webmasters, web publishers, or website owners that you partner with. This partnership entails you giving your affiliates advertisements, often in the form of links or banners. If you have an affiliate tracking software, that software can be used to let you know every time that one of your affiliate links or banners resulted in a sale.  If so, you will then be required to compensate your affiliate. This compensation is often a pre-determined amount that both of you agreed on.

If you are interested in purchasing an affiliate tracking software program, which you should be if you want to start your own affiliate program, you will need to make a decision. That decision involves the type of software you would like to purchase and from whom.  Online, you will find that there are a large number of individuals and companies that sell affiliate tracking software.  To decide which software is best for your business and your needs, you are advised to examine and compare a number of different programs.

Since there are a large number of different affiliate tracking software programs, you will likely find that each software program comes with its own unique services and features. Despite the fact that each software program is likely to have its own unique features, there are some common features and services that are found on most affiliate tracking software programs. Those features may include, but should not be limited to, customer service support, earning reports, categorization of affiliates, varied commission levels, and affiliate signups.

When you advertise that you are interested in starting an affiliate program it is likely that you will get a number of inquires. These inquires will likely be webmasters, website owners, and web publishers who are interested in signing up for your affiliate program. All of these inquires may be too much for you to sort out on your own. That is why a large number of affiliate tracking software programs also include affiliate signup forms.  These forms will help to keep your affiliate applications separate from all of your other important business paperwork.

One feature that is, almost always, included with most affiliate tracking software is detailed earnings reports. Detail earning reports are important for your financial record keeping. Without an earnings report, you would have to calculate all of this information by hand. An affiliate tracking software program can generate these reports for you in a matter of seconds. These reports will often give an outline of your affiliates click rates and their sales on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
Varied commission levels are something else that you may want to examine when searching for an affiliate tracking software.  Most new programs will offer this feature, but not all programs will. This important feature will allow you to pay each of your affiliates a different amount of money. For instance, you could pay one of your affiliates fifteen percent of each sale, but you may only want to pay another affiliate ten percent.  If that is the case, you will need this feature to accurately separate and document the earnings and commission levels for each affiliate.  

Another popular affiliate tracking software feature is customer service support. While customer service support is provided by almost all software developers and sellers, it is not offered by everyone. This popular feature is extremely important, especially if you are new to the world of affiliate marketing. With customer service support, a knowledgeable company representative should be able to assist you with any questions or problems that you have.

The above mentioned product features and services are just a few of the many that exist.  Other common features and services include, but should not be limited to, media banner displays, automatic banner rotations, affiliate referral signup programs, daily sales updates, payment reminders, and much more.  To determine whether or not the software you are interested in purchasing has these features, you are advised to fully examine all available information, including product descriptions.
