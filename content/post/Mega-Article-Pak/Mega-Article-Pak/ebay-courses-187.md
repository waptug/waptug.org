eBay Courses – Are They Worth It?

There are numerous eBay courses that are available 
on the Internet today. These books and courses are 
designed to help you become more successful on 
eBay. Unfortunately, not all of these courses are 
worth the money that you will pay for them. Some of 
them are full of what used to be good information – 
when it was relevant – and others are simply junk 
information, written by someone trying to make a 
quick buck.

Before you purchase any eBay course, find out when 
the course was written. If it was written in 2004, for 
instance, you don’t want it. Even though that hasn’t 
been very long ago, eBay changes so fast that much 
of the information will not be relevant. However, if the 
original issue of the course was written several years 
ago, but the course is updated each year, this will 
probably be a good course for you.

Again, use care when purchasing eBay courses. 
They can be quite helpful and enlightening, but only 
if the information in them is still good. Talk to other 
eBay sellers – preferably successful ones – to find 
out what courses are recommended.
