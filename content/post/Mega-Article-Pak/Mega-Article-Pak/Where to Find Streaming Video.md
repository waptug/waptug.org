First, we need to look at exactly what qualifies as streaming video.

Video is the medium that is used in the transfer of information, and we can all pretty much acknowledge that a video constitutes several different types of images strung together in a clip.  Streaming video is a series of images that are constantly being streamed, or played and broadcasted, from a distinct initial source.  There are many things around us that use streaming video.  One of the most obvious places would be on the internet.  Websites will either host streaming video, or videos that an individual can download.  This is beneficial to the individual that is interested in watching a video or a video clip since they will be able to decide for themselves which is most convenient to watch.

Having a choice between streaming and downloading simply opens up convenience and efficiency to the individual, which most people can appreciate.  Still, there are other places that can spring to mind when an individual is thinking about where to find streaming video.  Some of these places are just slightly less obvious.

The television is constantly playing streaming videos.  Channels on the television are broadcasting images, which are picked up by each individual television.  Many people may not realize that this is streaming video, but it is since each channel is being sent from a particular station, to the home that is watching that particular station.  When a channel goes offline, on television, it is no longer to be considered as streaming.  As soon as the channel or station turns on again, it is.  Some channels never go offline unless there is a power problem.  Another place that individuals may not realize represents streaming video would be security tapes and cameras.  Security cameras will be capturing images, and then broadcasting them either over the internet or into a television set.

Once the video gets to its location, there will be a security guard screening them, in many cases, in order to help prevent problems in a home or store.  Just like the television channels, the video cameras and televisions will only work utilizing the streaming method while the cameras are turned on and while the television is tuned to the channel that the video can be viewed on, completing the necessary connection.  These are some of the more obscure places in which an individual would be able to find streaming videos to play.  Streaming video helps to make people’s lives more convenient, so it can be very useful to know where to find streaming video in order to view the particular items a person is interested in viewing.
