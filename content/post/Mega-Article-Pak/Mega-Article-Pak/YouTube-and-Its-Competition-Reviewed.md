YouTube and Its Competition Reviewed

Do you enjoy watching videos online or even uploading and sharing your own videos with other internet users?  If you do, you will need to be on the lookout for websites that are known as video sharing websites.  These types of websites are ones that allow internet users to watch videos they have stored on their websites and they often allow internet users, just like you, to share their own videos. When it comes to finding a video sharing website to use, you will see that you have a number of different options.

One of the most popular and most well-known video sharing websites is that of YouTube.  It is not uncommon for YouTube to be discussed at your school, work, or even on your local news! Yes, that is how popular YouTube is.  If you are interested in viewing online videos, you will find that YouTube is your best chance for finding what you want, as they have an immeasurable number of videos hosted on their online website.  Also, if you register for a free YouTube account, you should be able to rate the videos that you watch, leave comments on the video page, or even talk about the video with other YouTube members.

If you are interested in uploading your own videos to the internet, you may also find the most success when using YouTube.  One of the reasons for that is the number of individuals who visit the site each day; it is a lot.  No matter what type of video you upload onto YouTube, your video is likely to get hundreds or even thousands of views.  The exposure is one of the reasons why so many video submitters turn to YouTube.  It is also important to mention ease of use, as uploading and sharing videos on YouTube is easy.  All YouTube members are able to upload their videos by following detailed, step-by-step instructions.  

Although YouTube is a great video sharing website to watch movie at or upload your own videos, you may be wondering about your other options.  One of those other options is Grouper.  Grouper is a video sharing website that allows internet users to both watch and share videos that they may have made themselves.  What is nice about Grouper is that they have a large collection of viewable videos and their upload process is also easy and self-explanatory. The only downside to using Grouper, particularly to share your own videos is that it isn’t as well known as YouTube.  However, with that in mind, Grouper is an online video website that is continuing to increase in popularity.

Another popular video sharing website is that of Google Video.  Google Video is ideal for those looking to share their own videos, as well as those looking to watch a large collection of videos. From a viewer standpoint, Google Video has a large collection of videos currently available.  In fact, they also have popular music videos or television shows available. The only downside is that many of these music videos and television shows are not free; however, only a small one-time fee is required to view them.  As with YouTube and Grouper, you can also upload your own videos to Google, once you become a member of Google.

When it comes to deciding which video sharing websites you would like to use, the decision is yours to make; however, you may want to consider examining all three.  No matter which video hosting website you choose, you will likely be pleased with your decision, as all three come highly rated and recommend.
