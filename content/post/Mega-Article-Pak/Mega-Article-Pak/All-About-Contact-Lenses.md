All About Contact Lenses

As most of us know, contact lenses are the best alternative to glasses.  They are small, plastic shaped discs that are made to correct eyesight problems like nearsightedness, astigmatism, farsightedness, and other problems.  Contact lenses are also used by those who have had cataract surgery, as they can help the eyes to heal a bit faster.

Contacts are used in the eye, where they will float above a sea of tears that rest in front of the cornea.  You should always go to a doctor to be fitted, as the proper fitting and design is very important for safety, comfort, and the accurate vision.  If you don’t get fitted for your contacts, you could very well get a pair of contacts that could damage your eyes.

There are several types of contact lenses available in two main types - hard contact lenses and soft contact lenses.  The hard contact lenses include gas permeable and the conventional hard lenses.  Soft contact lenses include daily wear, extended wear, and disposable wear.  These are all great contacts, although you should check with your optician to see what he recommends.

If you are just starting to wear hard contact lenses or have thought about them in the past, you’ll need a 2 - 4 week break period, where you will gradually wear the contacts longer and longer with each passing day.  Soft contacts on the other hand, will take less time to get used to, as most people who wear them can break them in a few days.

Contact lenses, as we all know, have many different uses. They are mainly used to correct vision, although they can also be used for those who have just had cataracts, especially if the natural lens around was removed.  Contacts can also be used in the treatment of various eye diseases, and scars on the cornea that have been caused by infections or injury.

Contact lenses are a great choice for those who have active lifestyles, such as athletes.  They won’t fall off like glasses when you run, nor do they hang off your face or fog up.  They also offer you a full field of vision as well, which is great for sports.  The lens and focus is the same as glass, meaning that you will get the same vision from contacts as you would with a pair of glasses.

A lot of people who have vision problems consider getting Lasik eye surgery to fix their vision problems so that they won’t have to wear glasses or contacts.  On the flip side, there are several risks and problems associated with this procedure, besides the fact that it is very expensive.  Contact lenses aren’t expensive, and they are a safe alternative to vision correction.

Keep in mind that contact lenses aren’t available without a prescription. Although you can get certain contacts without a prescription, they won’t correct your vision.  To get contacts that correct your vision, you’ll need to visit an eye doctor and get fitted for them.  Your doctor will tell you the health of your eyes, as well as the contacts you need to correct your vision.

For several years, contact lenses have been an ideal way to correct your vision.  They are more popular than glasses, and they won’t limit what you can and can’t do.  Contacts fit snugly in your eyes and they won’t make you feel out of place.  You can wear them with any type of clothing you desire - as it is very hard to tell if someone is wearing them or not.
