Building a Tree House or Fort: The Ultimate Backyard Experience

Each year, a large number of children play outside. Unfortunately, many of those children easily experience boredom. If you are the parent of one of those children, you may have searched high and low for the ultimate backyard experience.  In your search, it is likely that you may have come across tree houses or forts. These structures offer most children an unlimited amount of fun.  In fact, you may find that your child doesn’t want to leave their newly constructed tree house or fort.

While tree forts or houses are fun to play in, there is something that is even more exciting than playing in them.  The process of making and designing a tree house or fort is something that you and your child will likely never forget. Therefore, if your child does not already have a tree house or fort, you may want to consider making one.  To get the most out of this experience, you will want to make it together.

To build a tree house or fort, you may need to have a tree.  While a tree is a vital part of a tree house or a tree fort, it is not necessarily required.  If you only have small, unstable trees in your backyard or none at all, you can still build your child a fun play fort or house.  Instead of building the structure in a tree, you will just have to build it on the ground.

The first step in building or designing your own tree house or fort is to familiarize yourself with all of your options.  When making your child a tree house or fort, you can design the structure a number of different ways. Despite this freedom, you are advised to examine popular tree house or fort designs and plans. In addition to giving you structural ideas, you may also be provided with detailed construction manuals. 

Perhaps, the easiest way to familiarize yourself with tree house or fort designs is to use the internet. By performing a standard internet search, using the words tree house deigns, you should be provided with a number of different links. These links should take you to a website that offers tips, detailed directions, or ideas for building a tree house or fort. If you are able to find the tree house or fort of your child’s dreams, you may want to print off all applicable information, including building guides or instruction manuals.  

In addition to using the internet, to familiarize yourself with tree house or fort designs, you may also want to visit your local book store or library. There are a number of books and resources guides that are available. These resource guides, like the ones found online, should provide you with pictures and detailed directions.  If your local book store or library does not have any tree house or fort books, you may want to search for books online.  

Once you have found the tree house or fort that you would like to build, you will need to purchase building supplies.  These supplies may include, but may not be limited to, wood, nails, screws, and other common tools. In most cases, you should be able to purchase the supplies that you need from your local hardware store. If your local hardware store does not carry all of the needed materials, you should be able to find them for sale online.  

When it comes time to build your child’s tree house or fort, you will want to keep them involved in the process. While they may be uninvolved in actual building process, there are other ways that you can use their assistance.  After you have reviewed the construction directions, you may want to have your child read you the directions as you go along or hand you the materials that you need.  No matter how large or small their part is, your child will likely be happy that you involved them in the process.
