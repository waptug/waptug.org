Editing HD Video

Working with the video of camcorders such as the Sony
HDR-HC1 can produce a serious business.  HD video
contains four times the number of pixels that 
standard definition offers, and it's much more
heavily compressed.  

Keep in mind that you need a powerful computer with
a lot of memory to deal with the extra data and
compression.  Pinnacle for example, recommends a
minimum 512 MB of RAM and a graphics card with 128
MB of RAM for standard resolution video, although
that goes up to a GB of RAM and a 256 MB graphics
card when working with 1080i HD video.

You can find plenty of software available that
supports editing high definition videos.  For example,
the latest versions of Pinnacle Studio and Ulead
Media Studio 8 can import and edit files in HDV
format.  

Even though the high definition video with these
types of looks great when played back on an HDTV,
at the present time is there is no way store HD
video on a DVD.  The only way you can store HD 
video for playback is on your PC or the same type
of media you used in your HD camcorder.

There is however, a new generation of high definition
optical media format coming soon.  Products that
are based on the HD-DVD and Blu-ray disc formats
are very expensive, and they will remain that way
for the near future.  

HD-DVD players were announced a while back that 
they will cost $500 and up, and will be available
very soon.  You'll also need one of the new HD-DVD
drives to write to the disc, which will cost as
much again.  You can expect the same story with the
Blu-ray disc, as both the recorders and the players
are going to be expensive for a while to come.

There is one other option as well.  There is a 
DVD player from KISS, the DP-600, which can play
back high definition files that have been compressed
to Microsoft's Windows Media 9 format.  This can
at least provide a stop gap until the price of the
HD-DVD and Blue-ray disc players and writes come
down to an affordable price.

You can always play back the recorded video you 
have through the camcorder itself, although you
shouldn't expect to be able to write it out on a
disc with the current available equipment and 
preserve its quality.  If you wait it out, the new
generation of available media will be everything 
you need for your HD video.
