Pros and cons on the new iPod video

	
On the 12th of April 2005, the company Apple announced the upcoming iPod video. The product was about to reveal a new feature of the device, meaning the capacity of playing videos. 
	
As any new item that appears on the market, the iPod video managed to get fans and critics, at the same time. Due to the fact that it is a new and innovative item which brought something different to the concept of iPod, the new iPod video started many debates regarding its practical usage, accessories, qualities and all types of technical, visual and aesthetical features. 
	
The reviews so far explain that the quality of the image of the new iPod is very good and even the texts are highly visible. Still, the usage of the new device is more confusing. While some critics say that it revolutions the concept of iPod, which till now, it just meant hearing and not watching, as well, others sustain that the item is not that practical. Due to the fact that watching movies is a relaxant activity which requires a comfortable space and a certain amount of time, the iPod seems to promote the idea of watching movies on the run, while walking or doing some other activity. Even more, some people prefer to live the movie, with a wide screen in front of them, in the movie theatre or in their home. So, the idea of the iPod basically limits to watching music video clips or short episodes of comedy series. Even more, the battery of the new model of iPod dies after 2 hours of playing, which, in case of many movies, is not enough time to end. Still, while waiting at a line in the city or while sitting in the cab during a long ride, the iPod definitely provides the best way to spend the time. 
	
On the other hand, the new iPod is not all about playing movies or videos. Even thought the battery works perfectly for just 2 hours when playing a movie constantly, the estimated battery life is 20 hours (when listening to music), in comparison with the 16 hours that the last model of iPods offered, which is a big plus. Even more, the new iPod video has the largest color screen since the appearance of the devices in 2001, which can be used, besides playing videos, for a good visibility of the pictures and an increased sharpness of the text; plus, the new iPod video provides full-size thumbnails for photos imported from various cameras. Another plus in accessories is the protection sleeve for the main device, which comes as a result after iPod nano, meaning the previous generation of these product, which was easy to scratch. The sleeve is made of a synthetic material, in a pale nuance of grey with visible stitching and a velour-like inner surface. Besides the technical and practical qualities, the reviews also discuss about the new aspect of the device, which looks sharper and more elegant, in black and white colors.  
	
The new model of iPod shows, without any doubt, that the popular company and brand Apple are trying to evolve in order to satisfy the consumer’s needs, which are becoming more and more pretentious. Based on this, it is expected the new type of iPods to be improved even more with new video settings and accessories.
