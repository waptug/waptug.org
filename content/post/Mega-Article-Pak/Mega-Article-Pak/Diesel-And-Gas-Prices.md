Diesel And Gas Prices

Over the years, the prices of both gas and diesel 
have experienced some drastic changes.  Many years
ago, the price of gas was around a dollar or a
little more, nothing like it is today.  Back then,
gas wasn't high in price although the demand for
vehicles wasn't what it is today either.

As the demand for vehicles grew, the demand for 
fuel grew as well.  Other actions and events have
played into the equation as well, resulting in
the rising costs of fuel.  Fuel is something we
all need to run our vehicles, as we wouldn't be
able to go anywhere without it.  

As you may know, a majority of the gas we get at
local gas stations comes from overseas, primarily
the Middle East.  Therefore, we have to pay taxes
and such on the gas we use, which pays for the
gas as well as the shipping.  If we got our gas
from within the United States, one can't help
but wonder whether or not the prices would indeed
be lower.

Diesel on the other hand, has always managed
to keep a price lower than gas.  Diesel comes
from within the United States, so the prices are
of course going to be lower.  The only problem
associated with diesel fuel is locating it, as
many gas stations don't sell it.

When it comes to the choice between the two, 
diesel fuel is obviously cheaper to buy.  Gas is
in supply more, which means that you can find
it almost anywhere.  If you own a gasoline
vehicle, you obviously don't want to put diesel
in it.  If you own a diesel vehicle, then you
of course wouldn't want to put gas in it either.
