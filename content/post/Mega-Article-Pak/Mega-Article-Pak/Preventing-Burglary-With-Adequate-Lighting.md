Preventing Burglary With Adequate Lighting

As many already know, adequate lighting is a critical part of keeping your home safe.  Even though lighting is very important to home safety, a lot of homeowners don’t look at their lighting as being an integral aspect of safety.  No matter where you may live, you should always make sure that there is plenty of lighting in place and that the lights are out of reach for those without a ladder.

The lighting that is around the doors of your home is very important, as most burglars like to focus on doors before anything else.  When it comes to the doors of your home, any lighting at all is better than no lighting.  If a burglar sees lights around your home, chances are he’ll move on.  If the lights are off however, the burglar will more than likely proceed as planned.

If you own a garage, you should always use an automatic garage opener.  Once they have been activated, most will automatically turn on the lights.  Your carport is also important to safety.  If you are going to be away from home, you should always make sure that the leave the light on your carport on.  You can also use motion detected lights as well.  When these lights detect any type of movement, they will automatically turn on – which could easily startle a burglar.

For the exterior of your home, motion detected lights are the way to go.  If you have a large backyard, you should always make sure that you use motion detected lights.  To be on the safe side, you can always connect an alarm to the lights.  This way if someone was to move through your yard, the lights would sound the alarm.  Burglars don’t like alarms and they will normally flee the instant they hear an alarm sound.

If you are planning to use motion sensors in your front yard, you should make sure that you have planned the locations carefully.  People walking by the sensor or kids playing nearby can easily trigger it.  When you set the motion sensors up you should always make sure that you hook lights up to them as well.  This way, those in your family will know where the motion detectors are and they can easily avoid them.

Having the right amount of lighting around your home will go a long way in keeping your family safe.  Burglars don’t like to be around light, which is why it is so very important.  If you don’t have a lot of lights around your home, you should do something about it.  It doesn’t have to be anything fancy – all you need is enough lighting to make sure that a burglar thinks twice about breaking into your home.
