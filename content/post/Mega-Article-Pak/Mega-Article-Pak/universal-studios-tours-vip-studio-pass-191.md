Universal Studios Tours VIP Studio Pass

Unlike Disneyland, reservations cannot be made for 
any of the attractions within Universal Studios. 
However, you can get a VIP Studio Pass, which 
will allow you to skip many of the lines, and will 
even provide you with a personal tour of the back lot. 

The cost of the VIP Studio Pass is quite affordable 
– under $300 for two people, and it entitles you to 
many special perks….you get to see everything, 
including many things that are not part of the 
standard Universal Studios Tour, although the VIP 
tour actually starts with the standard Universal 
Studios Tour – then it just gets better.

If you are in possession of a VIP pass, you will be 
allowed to get off the tram and wonder around the 
movie sets. You will be allowed to visit the props 
department as well, which is great fun. You will also 
be entitled to prime seating at all of the shows, and 
have the opportunity to meet the cast members 
after the shows. 

If you will be going on a Universal Studios Tour and 
visiting the theme park, the VIP Studios Pass is 
definitely the way to go!
