Go green and save on your lease

Hybrid vehicles’ popularity has sharply grown from a couple of thousands
in early 2000 to close to 300, 000 by the end of 2005. The trend is 
rapidly catching with the auto-leasing industry with generous tax credits
and incentives on offer if you go green.

Beginning in 2006, businesses and taxpayers who lease, or purchase, an 
environmentally-friendly and fuel-efficient vehicle will be eligible to 
claim federal income tax credits worth thousands of dollars. Individual 
states also offer generous incentives, including hybrid state tax credits, 
new High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes access and discounted thruway tolls
for alternative-fuelled vehicles. 
And that’s not all you can save from going green! You can now save on your 
parking fees at a number of universities and some auto-insurance companies
are offering insurance discounts for hybrid-vehicle owners nationwide. 

If you want to take advantage of these incentives and contribute to energy 
conservation then visit HybridCenter.org and complete a personal profile 
about your driving needs and habits. You will get in-depth advice on hybrid
models that would make economic sense to you and local, state and federal 
incentives available where you live.
