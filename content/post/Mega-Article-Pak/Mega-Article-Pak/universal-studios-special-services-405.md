Universal Studios Special Services

Universal Studios strives to ensure that everyone who 
visits Universal Studio Tours has an enjoyable 
experience. While guest services are available for 
everyone, there are special guest services available 
for guests with more specialized needs. 

Guests in wheelchairs should have no problem 
accessing everything in the park, however, occasionally, 
some assistance may be required. If this occurs, 
staff members will be only too happy to assist. If 
special assistance is needed, please visit the 
Guest Relations desk, which is near the front 
entrance of the park. You can also contact Guest 
Relations in advance of your visit. Accessibility 
points for wheelchairs are marked with the 
International signs.

If you require a sign language interpreting service, 
one will be made available to you at Universal 
Studios Tours free of charge, with two weeks notice. 
Arrangements can also be made for closed 
captioning, assistive listening devices, and 
telecommunication devices for the deaf. TTY 
telephones are located at the Guest Services booth 
as well, and all pay phones throughout the park 
have the amplified feature.

Service animals are always welcome at Universal
Studios, and will be allowed in the restaurants, gift 
shops, and the attraction queues. For the safety 
and well-being of the animal, service animals will not 
be allowed on some of the rides or inside some of 
the attractions. Special arrangements can be made 
for the service animal while it’s owner enjoys the 
attractions, however. Non-service animals must be 
placed in the complimentary kennel, located right 
outside the park gates.

Pregnant women should avoid The Studio Tour, Back 
to the Future, and Jurassic Park. These are not 
suitable for expectant mothers, and may cause 
complications in the pregnancy, including early labor. 
Furthermore, pregnant women will be given special 
stationary seating for the Shrek 4-D attraction and the 
Terminator 2: 3D attraction. Speak with a cast member 
for assistance. You should speak with your doctor 
before planning a trip to Universal Studios Tours – 
he or she may advise against such a trip.

Spanish language tours are available every day that 
the park is open, and tours for other languages can 
be arranged with advance notice. Again, Universal 
Studios Tours wants everyone to have a pleasant 
experience at the park, and they will do everything 
possible to ensure this. If you have a special need, 
please call and speak with a cast member at the 
Guest Services Center, or visit the center upon 
your arrival to the park.
