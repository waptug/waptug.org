eBay University – What Is It All About?

eBay University is the learning program that eBay 
established to help people become successful eBay 
merchants. For convenience, eBay classes are held 
in many locations throughout the United States, and 
classes may also be completed from home, using 
your computer. 

You should note that all of the information you will 
learn through eBay University can be found on the 
website – for free. However, understanding that free 
information isn’t always easy. eBay University will 
teach you how to open a seller’s account, how to 
conduct research and create listings, how to improve 
listings for greater success, how to integrate Paypal 
with eBay, how to monitor your auctions, and how to 
complete transactions.

Once you’ve finished the Selling Basics course, you 
are ready for the ‘Beyond the Basics’ course. This 
advanced course will teach you how to start and 
grow an eBay business, how to choose and create 
listing formats that sell, how to use all of the eBay 
resources, how to market your business, how to 
pack and ship your items, and much more. Both 
courses are reasonably priced, and well worth the 
short amount of time that it takes to complete 
each course.
