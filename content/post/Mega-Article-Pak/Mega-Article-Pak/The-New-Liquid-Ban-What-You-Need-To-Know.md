The New Liquid Ban: What You Need to Know

Have you recently tried catching a flight?  If not, do you plan to do so in the future?  If so, there is a chance that you will notice some changes when you fly, those chances include new air travel rules. While a number of new rules have been implemented, there are some that may have a direct impact on you and how you pack your bags.  That new rule is a ban on all liquids.  

If you are planning of flying, whether it be tomorrow or in two months, you are advised to fully research and examine this new air travel ban. Since most individuals, including men, women, and children, fly with some sort of liquid, there is a good chance that you will need to alter your packing habits.  When examining the liquid ban, it is important to remember one thing.  Liquids are banned from being brought with you onto the airplane in your carry on luggage. This ban does not prohibit you from brining these items with you; it just means that you have to place them in your checked baggage.

When trying to determine which liquid items are prohibited from being stored in your carryon luggage, it is best to examine these items in different categories. This is because this new ban means that a large number of items are now only allowed in bags that will be checked upon arrival at the airport. In fact, there are too many items for you to individually learn about.

Some of the most popular items that are now included in the liquid air travel ban include health and beauty products, especially those that are liquid or gel based.  For skincare, these items include hand lotions, hand sanitizers, and moisturizing creams.  When it comes to cosmetics, all items are made of liquid are prohibited from being stored in your carryon luggage, even your purse. This means that you need to remove all mascara, liquid foundation, lip gloss, and other liquid based cosmetics from your carryon luggage.  Other beauty products include shampoo, conditioner, hair spray, styling gel, mouthwash, and toothpaste.  

In addition to health and beauty products, there are a fairly large number of food and drink products that you must either leave at home, discard before you enter the airport security area, or pack in your checked luggage. For beverages, this includes all liquid beverages, even those that are not opened.  If you purchase a drink from a sterile restaurant or shopping store, past airport security, you will have to consume your drink before you begin boarding for your flight.

When it comes to food, you will also find that, like most beverages, items with liquid in them are banned. These items include, but are not limited to jello, soup, pudding, and yogurt. If you need to have food or snacks with you, you will want to purchase something from the airport vending machines or bring a small, dry snack from home. These items are the safest and most convenient to have when snacking aboard an airplane.  


As you can easily see, there are an unlimited number of products, with a gel or liquid base, that you must place in your checked baggage.  However, there are a few exceptions to this new air travel rule. When it comes to drinks, the only drinks, allowed on the airplane with you and other travelers is infant formula or milk based products for babies.  While you can bring these items onboard, there is a good chance that they will be closely examined.  

Another exception includes eye care products and medications.  You are allowed to bring liquid medication onboard an airplane with you, as long as the medication is prescribed to you.  Airport security will likely verify that your name matches the name on the prescription bottle.  You can also bring onboard other non prescription products, including those needed for eye care; however, they must be no larger than four ounces in size. These items may include saline solution and eye drops.

By keeping the above mentioned information in mind, you should be able to prepare for your flight without having to be worried about airport security checkpoints. As long as you properly pack you bags, you shouldn’t experience any problems with airport security.
