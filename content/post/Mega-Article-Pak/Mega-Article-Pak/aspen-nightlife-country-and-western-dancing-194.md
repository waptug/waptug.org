Aspen Nightlife – Country & Western Dancing

Believe it or not, there is only one place in 
Aspen where you can scoot a boot across the 
dance floor to the sounds of George Strait, and 
other Country & Western favorites – Shooter’s 
Salon. Shooter’s Salon is located on South 
Galena Street, and they are open from 6:30pm 
to 2am every day, and again, this club has the 
distinction of being the only Country & Western 
club in the whole town of Aspen, Colorado.

Here, cowboy hats, creased jeans, and boots 
are the expected attire. During the week, the 
music is provided by a DJ, and on weekends 
live bands provide the tunes. If you don’t know 
how to do the Texas Two-Step, you can learn 
how on any Thursday night which is when 
Shooter’s offers free Country dance lessons. 

Good beer, good music, great dancing, friendly 
games of pool or darts – Shooter’s is a place 
where all cowboy’s and cowgirl’s will feel right 
at home. If you want to let your hair down, 
without having to worry about breaking any of
the rules set by ‘polite society’ in the other fine 
establishments located in Aspen, Shooter’s is 
the place to do it!
