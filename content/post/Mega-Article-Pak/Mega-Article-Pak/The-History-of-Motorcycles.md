The History of Motorcycles

Most of us have ridden on a motorcycle at one time or another. The idea for their design came from the development of the bicycle. I guess people were looking for a faster way to move their bicycle along, or perhaps one that wasn’t as physically exerting for them. The first motorcycle every made is credited to Gottllieb Daimler in 1885. This gas powered motorcycle was basically a gas engine attached to a standard bicycle. However, Gottllieb decided not to pursue making motorcycles and choose instead to focus on manufacturing cars. 

During this time period, many other individuals were also tinkering with the motorcycle concept. A couple of the men behind this experimenting were William Harley and Arthur Davidson. You guessed it, the dynamic duo behind the amazing line of Harley-Davidson motorcycles that have become popular all around the world since 1903. 

People were very interested in this convenient mode of transportation because it was very economical. The public loved the idea of motorized transportation, but cars were still more expensive than most people could afford. However, some people soon realized that they would need to purchase a car instead of a motorcycle in order to transport their entire family. 

A few of these motorcycle pioneers were able to successfully establish companies such as Harley-Davidson. However, many never had the money to start the venture properly and make it prosperous. Others left to go fight in the war and still others went bankrupt trying to market their motorcycle ideas during the Depression. 

One downfall to motorcycles in the 1950’s is that you had to have a great understanding of mechanics to be able to operate one. The American bike manufacturers didn’t pursue making advances in that department until they started facing competition from Japan. They developed the electric start system that motorcycles offer today. This important feature allowed motorcycles to transform from small mopeds and scooters to powerful machines. 

American motorcycle manufacturers did not see Japanese bikes as a threat, but this was as serious miscalculation on their part. It didn’t take long for American manufacturers to realize that they were losing consumers to the Japanese market. This lead to the introduction of many new models to prevent them from losing more of the market. Baby boomers continued to purchase Japanese bikes as they offered more power and were sold at an excellent price. 

Motorcycles have certainly changes since their introduction. Today, the market is saturated with brand names that are well known in the motorcycle industry. Each one offers a variety of models to choose from as well as unique styles and designs. Regardless of the type of motorcycle you are interested in, you are sure to find one with the features and power you are looking for. 

As the top motorcycle manufacturers continue to strive to come up with models that will please the consumer while out shining their competitors, you will have even more choices. As technology advances you will find faster, more durable, and less expensive motorcycle options on the market. Harley-Davidson continues to be in the top position, selling more motorcycles than any other manufacturer. In fact, the majority of their bikes are sold before they even leave the factory. While they remain one of the most expensive motorcycle producers, consumers are willing to pay for the quality and the power behind them. 

When it comes to the motorcycle industry, consumers have come to learn that quality and reliability are more important than saving a few dollars along the way. A motorcycle is generally a large investment, and consumers want to be happy with the product they choose. The issue of brand name loyalty also comes into play with motorcycles. Since each manufacturer now offers a full line of different models and types of motorcycles, there is no reason why you can’t purchase both the brand and the style you are looking for.
