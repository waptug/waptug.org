Installing Shutters

Installing your shutters isn't a difficult process
at all.  The key here is to work with shutters that
are specifically built for each individual window
opening in conjunction with detailed instructions.

Many companies that install shutters will tell
customers that the shutters need to be installed
by a certified installer.  This isn't the case,
as you can install your shutters like a pro with
no experience at all.

Measuring your shutters
To properly install shutters to a window opening, 
you'll need to measure.  First, you'll need to
determine if the shutters will be mounted to the
inside or the outside of the window opening.

Inside mount installation
The preferred means of installation is to mount
shutters directly to the window jamb inside of the
window opening.  This method is generally cleaner
than mounting to the outside of the window and
it doesn't require additional hang strips or frame
strips.  Keep in mind, the window must be somewhat
square and have a solid jamb for you to attach
the screws to.

To determine the window depth, measure from the
front plane of the window back to the nearest
obstruction that'll prevent the louvers from
rotating.  If you prefer, the company you are
ordering from can also tell you the window depth
for the style of shutters you order.

On occasion, a supplier of shutters will offer
a second inside mounting method that uses rear
hanging strips concealed behind the shutter
panels that will allow adjustment up, down, left,
and right for easier alignment.  This method
is ideal if the window is out of square or if
it has a drywall opening without a solid wood
jamb.

Outside mount installation
Outside mount installations use frames that attach
to the wall or existing trim just to the outside
of the opening of the window.  Normally, the 
frame will surround the shutter panels on three
or four sides, depending on if a lower still
exists.  

If you go with a cafe type shutter style, the
hang strips are used on either side of the 
shutter panels.  The frame or hang strips will
screw directly to the wall or trim, and the
shutter hinge to the frame or the hanging strips.

Always play it safe and measure with a steel tape
measure, which will give you the most accurate
measurements.  Don't attempt to measure with a 
fabric tape or yard stick - as this will lead
you to a poor installation.
