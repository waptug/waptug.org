The Pros And Cons Of Beer

Although beer is a drink that contains alcohol, the alcohol alone doesn’t make it dangerous to your health.  Drinking beer excessively is what leads to hangovers, headaches, and the more severe healthy problems.  If you drink beer in moderation and avoid getting drunk, you won’t experience any problems with your health.

One of the most common things people say about beer, is that it makes you fat, hence the term “beer belly”.  As a whole, beer contains little to no fat, and there are plenty of beer diets out there that you can use to stay thin.  The infamous beer belly is caused by consuming too much alcohol, which affects the body’s ability to burn fat.  Even though beer can indeed lead to a “beer belly” if you drink too much of it, if you drink in moderation you should be fine.

Even though beer is low in sugar, it can affect your blood sugar levels.  Beer contains alcohol, which can drop the natural level of sugar in your blood, leading to low energy levels.  If you drink too much beer, you’ll get really tired and go right to sleep.  Alcohol in beer will also lower insulin levels as well, which makes it perfect for non diabetics, as it will reduce the risk of arteriosclerosis.

In the past, research has linked beer with reducing the risk for heart disease.  Beer contains no cholesterol, although it does have antioxidant qualities that can reduce LDL oxidation, with may help reduce your risk of heart disease.  Beer is also an excellent source of fiber, stemming from the malted barley.  Beer can also help to reduce stress, if you drink it in moderation.

To get the health benefits that beer provides, you should drink one beer a day.  You shouldn’t drink any more than this, as it can easily lead to health problems.  Alcohol will thin out your blood, which will protect your heart and reduce the risk of strokes as well.  In the past, research has even shown moderate consumption of alcohol can help with improving your memory as well.  Then again, if you drink it excessively, it can destroy brain cells - the adverse effect.

Beer is also nutritious, although it can destroy your levels of vitamin C as well.  Beer is a great source of fiber, as well as other minerals, such as potassium, magnesium, and several B vitamins such as B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, and B12.  Beer contains high levels of these vitamins, along with other minerals that are actually good for your body.  Although it offers plenty of B vitamins and other minerals your body needs, it will also destroy your vitamin C - which is why you never want to drink too much of it.

When it all comes down to it, beer may contain over 95% water, yet it is still a diuretic.  Due to the fact that beer contains alcohol, it will always be a diuretic.  When you drink beer, you should avoid drinking too much and never, ever, drink beer instead of water.  Beer can dehydrate your body fairly quickly, which is one of the biggest cons to drinking beer.  Although beer does have several health benefits, they can easily be hindered by drinking too much.  To stay on the safe side and avoid headaches and other health effects of beer, you should always drink responsibly, never drink too much - and always drink a few glasses of water when you are drinking beer.
