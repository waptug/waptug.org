Making Your Own Off-Road Supercross or Motocross Track

Are you interested in participating in a fun sport?  If so, there is a good chance that you may find what you are looking for in supercross motorcycle racing. Supercross motorcycle racing is an action packed sport that uses indoor, man-made tracks as a racing surface. This surface is often filled with a number of jumps and other obstacles.  Although your dream may be to become a professional supercross motorcycle racer, it may not always be able to come true.  However, this does not mean that you cannot enjoy the sport; you can enjoy it on a recreational or an amateur level.

Although it would be best to find a local supercross or motocross track, that can’t always happen.  As popular as supercross motorcycle racing and motocross racing is, not every city and town has a track.  If you are unable to find one of these tracks, you may still be able to participate in off-road biking or racing. You can easily do this by making your own race track. This is definitely possible, especially for those with a fairly decent amount of property.

If you have access to an indoor facility, one that is about the size of a football field, you may be able to create your own indoor supercross racing track.  If not, you may have to settle for an outdoor motocross-like track.  Whichever track you decide to make, you will find that the construction is often just as exciting as the racing.  This is because you will get to control your racing surface.  Essentially, this means that you can have as many jumps as you would like, as well as other fun obstacles.  Although it is fun to develop your own supercross or motocross racing track, you will also find that it is a large amount of work.

The good news with making an outdoor track is that you will already have the something in your favor; different conditions.  Depending on the type of property that you are building on, you may already have a number of small hills or rough terrain.  If so, this would make building your track a little bit easier.  Whether you are building an indoor track or an outdoor track, you will need to have dirt. Dirt is essential to the building of a motocross track.  Luckily, you can find it at a number of locations.  In addition to getting dirt from your own property, you may also be able to get it from other homeowners or business owners, especially those that are doing some remodeling. The only problem with this is that you will have to find a way to get the dirt to your track.

Once you have found a way to get the dirt to your track, you will need to start building it.  This process will involve a lot of creativity. If you do not already have obstacles in mind, you can easily familiarize yourself with some designs.  You can do this by using the internet to your advantage.  By studying pictures or videos of supercross or motocross races, you should be able to get a feel for the track, as well as racing or riding on it.  It is amazing some of the ideas you can come up with just by looking at pictures or by watching videos.

When making your own supercross or motocross track it is important to remember that you will rarely get things right the first time. It takes a lot of trial and error to build to the perfect off-road racing track.  However, once you finish that track, you will likely be pleased with your decision to start the project, as well as proud of the results.
