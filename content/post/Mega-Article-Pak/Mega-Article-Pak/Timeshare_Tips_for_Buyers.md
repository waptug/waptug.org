Timeshare Tips for Buyers

Every individual waits for that time of the year, a much deserved time off from the hectic activities of day to day life. And when the time comes you keep wondering where to go? Where to stay? Etc. And each time you think I should have planned it out before itself. Smart people plan their vacations long before they actually go out for one. And even smarter people buy timeshare property for vacations to have a peace of mind and a place where they love to enjoy and cherish most beautiful memories in the comfort of your home like atmosphere. Everyone wishes to have a timeshare property at their favorite vacation place. While it may be easy to buy for some, but for some it may be their lifetime savings or hard earned money. So, nobody would like to invest their money in a losing proposition. Here we discuss some of the important things that you have to remember while buying a timeshare.

The first thing to do before buying any timeshare is to understand the types of timeshare. There are basically two types of timeshare plans. A deeded plan, in which you actually buy a piece of real estate property and own it along with other owners but, you can use it only according to the timeshare agreement. A fixed unit, fixed week, deeded timeshare allows you to own a specific timeshare at a specific time each year. A floating time agreement allows you to be flexible about the dates that you can use your timeshare. But reservations may be only first come first serve as many owners would like to go for that option. Right to use timeshare or a non-deeded timeshare is a leased timeshare. Again it is classified into fixed unit and floating time just as in the case of deeded timeshare. You no longer have rights to the property after the lease expires.

Before investing in a timeshare do your homework about the location first. Do a good research about the location, whether you can go there on a yearly basis. Also it wouldn’t hurt if you research the prices of other alternative accommodations in that place. If you are paying for the timeshare then why buy timeshare if an alternative costs you less. But at the same time you should weigh in your comfort factor also. The alternative accommodation might not provide you with the same comfort as the timeshare accommodation. So, it all depends on what criterion is important to you, cost or comfort.

Always find out your timeshare rights before buying. Your rights may be violated in some cases. In most of the cases the timeshare properties are governed by legal documents known as Covenants, Codes, and Restrictions. It establishes rights for real estate property owners and governs how the timeshare should be managed.

Also important thing to consider before buying a timeshare is to decide whether you want to buy it for vacation purpose only or as an investment. If you want to buy it as an investment you should rethink. Timeshares are not one of the most lucrative properties for reselling. Generally timeshare properties don’t have good resale value and the resale is also difficult due to competition from the original seller himself. 

While you may think that the cost of buying a timeshare is simply the cost of buying only the real property. You may be wrong. Because you should always calculate the total cost of time share which includes mortgage payments, maintenance fees, taxes, travel cost, closing cost, broker commissions, financing charges etc. That will definitely raise your hair. Compare the cost of alternative accommodation with the total cost of owning a timeshare now. Go with whichever is cheaper.

Also do not forget to read each and every document carefully before signing any agreement. Never ever believe on promises made by word of mouth. Request everything in written. Also find out about the reputation of the seller and whether he is a licensed timeshare seller. Also never accept properties with unfinished facilities, if you do so take a written commitment from the seller that they would be finished within a specific time frame.
