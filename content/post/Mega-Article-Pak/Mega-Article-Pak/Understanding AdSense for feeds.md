Understanding AdSense for feeds

Google AdSense program offers more than one way of earning revenue from serving Google AdSense Ads. Though â€˜AdSense for Feedsâ€™ is one of the more recent ways of advertising using Google AdSense Ads, itâ€™s in no way less effective than the others. Here, Google places the Ads of the advertisers in the relevant feed articles (again, note the most important characteristic of the Google AdSense program comes into play here too i.e. â€˜relevant feedâ€™ not just any feed).

The feeds are in the form of articles, headlines or summaries. These content formats allow the users to easily access the content from several publishers (content owners) at one place. This is achieved through feed aggregators like Bloglines etc. Again, Google uses its technology to determine what advertisements would be contextually suited for a particular feed. You get paid as the publisher of original content and hence make easy money. As for the readers, they as such get a rich experience because they can see the relevant advertisements with the content that they are interested in. Moreover, they can also choose the feeds that they want. Users can click the advertisements to visit the advertiserâ€™s website and check if their products and/ or services are of any use to them. Of course, the Advertisers benefit too. They get targeted advertising which means only the really interested people get to know about their products and services (and hence there are more chances of a better conversion rate for sales).

So, the prime concept for â€˜AdSense for feedsâ€™ remains the same as the Google AdSense program; only the orientation changes a bit. But note that Google is currently beta testing â€˜AdSense for feedsâ€™. Beta test for the program quickly got fully subscribed, so Google is not accepting any more applications for AdSense for feeds.

Itâ€™s only a matter of time before Google AdSense for feeds hits the internet and opens another revenue earning opportunity for website owners.
