Buying A Golden Puppy

We all know that Golden Retrievers are beautiful, obedient, and make great family pets and hunting dogs.  Golden’s also make great guide dogs for the blind, narcotic detection dogs, and even tracking dogs for finding missing people.  Although there are many other dog breeds out there, Golden Retrievers remain one of the most versatile and most astonishing breeds that you can get.

Before you rush out and buy a Golden Retriever puppy, you should first take the time to learn a bit more about the breed.  You can attend dog shows, meet with various owners of Golden Retrievers, and even go to your local kennel club.  Most people who own Golden Retrievers are extremely proud of them and will be more than happy to share their enthusiasm with you.

When you buy you’re Golden Retriever puppy, it’s always a great idea to buy from a backyard breeder or local puppy mill. Backyard breeders are normally the best way to get a Golden puppy, as they know and care a lot about the breed in general.  Although you can always go to a reputable breeder, backyard breeders aren’t just in it for the money - they actually care about their dogs and want you to get the best Golden possible.

You can also visit the Golden Retriever Club of America and their local member clubs, as they can supply you with a list of breeders in your area.  If these breeders don’t have any Golden’s for sale themselves, they will be more than willing to help you find what you’re looking for.  This way, you can get a Golden from a very reliable source.

Whatever you do, you should never rush into buying a Golden Retriever.  You should always take your time, and have a little bit of patience.  When you buy your puppy, you want a healthy puppy who will grow up to be a fine testament of the breed.  By taking your time and making a careful decision, you can save yourself a lot of time and money later on down the road.

Golden puppies that are poor quality, are normally produced by breeders who just want to have a litter or breeders who are just looking for the profits and care very little about giving thoughts to looks, quality, or temperament.  If you buy a puppy from either of these breeders, you’ll more than likely end up with a puppy who has poor health, poor temperaments, and even disqualifications in breed.

When you get your puppy, you should always think long term.  Only buy from a quality breeder, and you shouldn’t have anything to worry about.  Always remember that you aren’t just buying a Golden Retriever puppy - you are buying a companion and a friend for life.
