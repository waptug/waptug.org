Easy Wedding Favors

While wedding favors may be one of the simplest part of planning a wedding, they can also be the part of the wedding which is often left until the last minute. This can make shopping for wedding favors quite stressful. However, fortunately, there are a number of different options for wedding favors which are very easy to do at the last minute. This is important because it can take a great deal of stress out of realizing the wedding is rapidly approaching and wedding favors have not yet been purchased. This article will provide a few simple ideas for really easy wedding favors.

Using flowers as wedding favors is undoubtedly one of the easiest wedding favors you can give to your guests. There is virtually no preparation involved in this wedding favor and depending on how many guests you have at the wedding you may not have to order the favors well in advance. You might consider giving your guests a single red rose as a favor. This is extremely appropriate because a rose is a symbol of love. It is also very easy because it does not have to be wrapped. You can simply purchase one rose for each guest and have a member of the catering hall staff or a friend or family member place one rose across each place setting after the tables have been set for the wedding. You can also select a flower which is used in your centerpiece and instruct your florist to place one flower at each place setting when they arrange the centerpieces. 

Candy can also be an extremely easy wedding favor. There are a number of ways to give candy as wedding favors such as giving each guest a small tin or basket filled with candy. However, there is an even easier way to give candy as a wedding favor and also help you to save money on centerpieces. This can be accomplished by using large bowls filled with different types of candy as the centerpieces on each table. You can then provide each guest with a small bag and a note encouraging them to enjoy the candy in the centerpiece. Your guests will fill up the bags with the candy in the centerpieces making this an extremely easy gift which does not involve wrapping a favor for each guest. 

Pictures frames are a very easy wedding favor especially if they are used as place card holders. Pictures frames are often used as wedding favors but must people spend a great deal of time wrapping each favor individually to create a beautiful presentation for the guests. However, this is not the only way to give a gift of picture frames. Wrapping each frame individually can be very time consuming and can create a great deal of additional stress for the bride and the groom if they are struggling to get a lot of last minute things done in the days before the wedding. However, if you use the picture frames to hold the place cards, you do not have to worry about wrapping the favors for your guests. This makes it significantly easier to give a favor of picture frames.

One final idea for a very easy wedding favor is to give each guest a digital photo of themselves at the wedding. You can accomplish by hiring a photographer to take a picture of each couple as they arrive at the wedding reception. You can request that the photographer bring a high speed printer along to print the photos out quickly. This way you can distribute the photos before your guests begin to leave the reception. This is a great idea for a wedding favor because your guests will likely be dressed up and will appreciate the opportunity to pose for a professional photo. You can even ask the photographer if it is possible to put together a quick slideshow presentation which the guests can view after all of the photos have been taken. This way the guests not only get a personal memento of the wedding but they also get the opportunity to see how the photos turned out for all of the other guests as well.
