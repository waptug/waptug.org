MySpace or Your Space?

MySpace is quickly revolutionizing the dating scene. MySpace advertises themselves as a virtual community for users to network, meet people, browse profiles and make friends around the world. However, some are taking this ability to meet people even further and are using MySpace similarly to the way they would use a dating website. While couples are still meeting in more traditional locations such as nightclubs and bar, more and more couples are making love connections online via MySpace. 

MySpace allows members to create websites where they can post personal information about themselves and allow others to view this information and post messages commenting on the website. Through these interactions users can really get to know each other better and can foster relationships. This article will take a look at how MySpace users can meet other users, begin courting and possibly eventually meet romantic partners offline. 

Meeting New People on MySpace

Meeting new people on MySpace is unbelievably easy. The search feature allows anyone to search through the MySpace community to find user websites that contain the search term entered. Individuals do not have to be members to view the search results; however, some websites might be private and not viewable by the general public. Entering search terms relevant to a particular hobby or interest will generate search results of those who share this interest or hobby. 

Once an individual finds a number of websites from those who share their interests they can review these websites to determine if they wish to meet any of these MySpace members. One way to open the lines of communication with another user is to post a comment on their website. Only members of the MySpace community are allowed to post comments though so before leaving a comment users have to become members of the community. This also gives the user the opportunity to generate their own MySpace website. They can then invite those they are interested in meeting to view their website. 

Flirting on MySpace

As previously, mentioned MySpace is quickly becoming a location to allow users to meet potential romantic partners. MySpace gives users the opportunity to publish photos of themselves as well as personal information making it an ideal opportunity for users to get to know each other in a safe environment. Users can also post information such as age, marital status, hobbies and interests so users can get to know each other better. 

For many MySpace allows those who are normally more shy to feel confident about flirting with potential romantic partners. Those who usually don’t feel confident in crowded nightclub or bar settings may be able to express their feelings more freely through MySpace. They may also have the confidence to approach others they would not normally approach in a face to face situation. 

Making Romantic Connections on MySpace

With so many opportunities to meet others through the MySpace community, it is no surprise that many of these users are making these online connections a reality by meeting their online friends in the real world. These face to face meetings can be a lot of fun but care should be taken in these situations to avoid putting yourself at risk.

It is important to remember that the Internet can allow individuals to mask their true identities. This makes it easy for harmful predators to pretend to be one person online to attract others who might be interested in meeting them offline when, in reality, they are a completely different person. 

When meeting others online it is important to take precautions to safeguard personal information. Most people are aware they should not give out their address, social security number, credit card number, bank account number and other similar sensitive information but do not realize other information can also be harmful. For example seemingly innocent information such as the name of the high school attended and year of graduation can allow criminals to combine this information with other information such as a first name to determine where a person lives.
