Grooming and Brushing Tips for Dogs That Are Hypoallergenic

Buying a hypoallergenic dog may help reduce allergic reactions to dog hair and dander, but these dogs require special attention because of their hair. Most of these breeds have short coats that resemble human hair rather than traditional fur. As a result, these dogs shed as much as humans, which means they require regular haircuts just like human beings do. Grooming is an essential part of taking care of a hypoallergenic dog. If you do not have the time to schedule regular appointments or the money to pay for three of four groomings a year, then you may have to buy another breed of dog. 

While there are tools that you can use to groom your dog, if you do not feel comfortable or if your dog gets angry when you try to groom them, then you will have to find a professional groomer that will trim your dog’s hair. Groomers can be found in the phone book, online, or at chain pet stores. Choosing a groomer is not difficult, but sometimes finding one that does a good job can be. 

The first time your dog visits a groomer, tell them how much hair to trim. When you bring the dog home, inspect the hair to see that the cut is even, that there are no cuts on the dog’s skin, and that it was cut to your specifications. If the groomer did not do their job, then you should find a new one. But if the dog was happy being with groomer and they did what you asked, then you should continue visiting them. Groomers can also trim the hair on your dog’s face and clip their nails.

In between groomings, you will have to brush your dog so that the hair does not clump or become matted to their skin. This can cause a lot of health issues and could cause the dog to be uncomfortable. A good grooming brush should not cost too much and your groomer can recommend the right style for your dog. Always brush in the direction of the hair and not against it as this will cause matting to occur. Your dog should enjoy the way the brush feels. You can brush your dog at any time as long as they are comfortable. It will only take a few minutes to properly brush your dog. 

Matted hair can be difficult to untangle and you may need to bathe your dog in order to loosen the knots. Do not pull too hard or your dog will get unset. If the matted piece will not untangle, you should wait until the next grooming for it to be cut out. If knots persist, then you may need to brush your dog more often or have its hair cut even shorter. 

Grooming and brushing are two ways that pet owners can show love toward their pets. Hypoallergenic dogs are special because more people can tolerate being around them. In return, it is your job to make sure their coat is always healthy.
