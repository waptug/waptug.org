Money Making Tips

Affiliate marketing is all about getting paid for
selling products you don't own and not going to 
jail for it.  Someone else goes through all of the
trouble to develop software programs, service, or
digital content products.  They'll do all the work
then you collect the money!

Affiliate marketing is a revenue sharing arrangement
between the product developer, known as the affiliate
merchant, and the affiliate marketer who is anyone
that's willing to promote the sale of product by
advertising the product using any type of legal
means available.

The relationship will allow the affiliate merchant
to grow their revenue by paying only for the 
advertising that results in a sale.  The affiliate
marketer will profit by making a percentage on a 
sale that he does not have to manage after the
sale.

Getting paid
Getting paid all depends upon how the affiliate
program is set up.  Some merchants will run their
own affiliate program.  They'll have special types
of software that assigns each affiliate marketer
a special link that's used in promoting the product.
The software will track sales of every marketer
and the merchant will pay the commission on a 
periodic basis using either PayPal or another 
method of payment.

Selecting products or services
Your income is directly tied to how well your 
selected product or service sells, and the size of
the commission you earn, which makes it very 
important that you choose carefully when it comes
to choosing the affiliate merchant you'll be
partnering with.

Choose programs that you aren't embarrassed to 
promote and programs that you'll feel comfortable
recommending to your family and friends if they 
were to ask you about it.

You'll do much better if you promote products 
that you fully understand and are already familiar
with.  This way, you'll be able to write better
ads without having to strain yourself coming up
with the right things to say.

You should only promote products and services for
companies who have gone through the trouble to 
provide you with training programs and sales aids
such as banners and other marketing materials that
you can either use directly or model the one you
own after.

Be on the lookout for programs with commission
rates no less than 50%.  You should give preference
to programs that pay commission on multiple levels,
which means you'll also have to earn commissions
on sales made by people who buy the products 
through your link then go on and become affiliates
themselves later on.
