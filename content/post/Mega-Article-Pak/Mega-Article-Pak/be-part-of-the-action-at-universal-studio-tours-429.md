Be Part of the Action at Universal Studios Tours

Have you ever dreamed of being on a reality show? 
Here is your chance! Universal Studios Tours now 
has Fear Factor Live, which is a stunt show that 
uses audience volunteers. With three to five shows 
each day, the chances of getting on the show are
 pretty good!

Are you ready to face your fears? There are some
 important things to know about Fear Factor Live at 
Universal Studios Tours before you sign up. First,
 this is for real. This is not a cheesy attempt to 
replicate Fear Factor and please a studio audience. 
The stunts are very real, and they are performed by 
audience members just like you. There is no 
coddling here!

If you still want to participate, simply visit the casting 
office, which is located near the Terminator ride in 
the theme park. You must meet certain physical 
requirements to ensure that you can handle what 
is about to be asked of you. You must also 
complete and sign a liability form, holding Universal 
Studios and Fear Factor harmless of any injuries or 
damages you may incur. 

Before the show begins, some audience members 
who were not selected to participate are called on 
stage to face smaller challenges, such as eating 
various bugs. The winner of the pre-show contest 
wins great prizes, such as an annual pass to the 
theme park. This is followed by an audience warm 
up with the hosts of the show. 

The show consists of six contestants that were 
chosen from the casting office – if your lucky, you 
might be one of these! They are dressed just as the 
contestants on the original Fear Factor dress – in 
tight uniforms. A series of challenges, much like the 
challenges on Fear Factor are presented to the 
contestants. Falls from high places, skill tests, and 
of course, the famous gross-out challenge. During 
the show, a random audience member is picked 
for yet another challenge – such as sticking their 
head in a tank full of scorpions.

If you’ve ever watched Fear Factor, and told all of 
your friends that you could handle everything that 
was thrown at those contestants, be careful. Here is 
your big chance to prove yourself – or your friends’ 
chance to prove you wrong! Win or lose, Fear 
Factor Live at Universal Studios Tours could be the 
highlight of your visit! If you want to be on the show, 
visit the casting office as soon as you get to the 
park to make sure that you meet the physical 
requirements – and if you don’t meet the 
requirements, ask about being in the audience.
