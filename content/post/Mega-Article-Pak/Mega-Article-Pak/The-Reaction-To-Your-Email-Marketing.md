The Reaction to Your Email Marketing

Email marketing can actually be much more effective than most people think. Many business owners do not invest a great deal of time, energy or money into orchestrating an email marketing campaign because they mistakenly believe all email marketing is viewed as spam. However, this is simply not true. Business owners who have discovered how to market via email successfully, enjoy a great deal of success with this type of marketing. This article will discuss how email marketing can be successful and will provide insight into how to determine how your email marketing is being received.

Before we can discuss how to determine the reaction to your email marketing campaign, it is important for business owners to understand how to plan and execute an email marketing campaign which is successful. Perhaps one of the most important elements of type of campaign is to ensure your marketing efforts are not viewed by the recipients as being spam. One way to do this is to carefully develop your email distribution list. Although you can reach a tremendous audience by sending out your email marketing materials to a large email list, this is not effective when you do not know much about whether or not the members of this email list will even be interested in your products or services. It is important to note that reaching a huge audience is not more important than reaching a highly targeted audience. 

Focusing your email marketing efforts on millions of recipients who do not have a specific interest in your products or services is not nearly as effective focusing your email marketing efforts on only hundreds of email recipients who are likely to be very interested in your products or services. This is because you are much more likely to generate sales from a small, target group than you are from a large group without a specific focus. 

Now that you know a little bit about email marketing and how it can be effective, you might wonder how you can determine just how effective your email marketing efforts are in the long run. This is important because it is not worthwhile to invest a great deal of time, energy and money into an email marketing campaign if your efforts are not generating results. Likewise, if your email marketing campaign is widely successful, you might want to consider organizing additional marketing efforts to further your success.

Customer surveys are one of the easiest ways to evaluate the reaction to your email marketing campaign. Asking customer to fill out simple surveys when they make a purchase can provide a great deal of insight depending on the questions you ask. Questions such as where the customer learned about your products and services may seem rather innocuous but this information can actually be rather useful to the business owner. Learning where a customer learned about the products and services you offer, provides excellent feedback for which of your marketing efforts are generating the most interest. If you receive a great deal of responses stating customers learned about your products or services through emails, this is a good indication that your email marketing campaign is effective. 

Another very popular way to evaluate the reaction to your email marketing efforts is to closely monitor your rate of sales as well as your website traffic immediately after you issue a new email to members of your distribution list. This can be helpful because an increase in sales or website traffic after an email was issued is a strong indication that the email was well received and encouraged recipients to visit the website and make purchases. However, there is one caveat to this method of evaluation. It can be quite difficult to determine whether or not the emails caused the increase in website traffic and sales if more than one marketing effort was made at the same time. For example if you issue an email at the same time as you launch a banner ad, you cannot determine which one is more effective and is driving the increase in sales and traffic.
