Cross Country Mountain Biking

Cross country mountain biking is cross country at
its finest.  Where free riders and downhill bikers
use four wheel bikes and ski lifts to get them to
their destination, cross country bikers get to 
the top of the mountain by the ride.  Though free
riding is very popular, the life vein of the sport
has always been cross country biking.

Just as cross country riders are a different breed,
the bikes they ride are as well.  The cross country
bike is completely different in many ways from other
types of mountain riding bikes.  The premise for 
cross country riders is speed.  Everything about
their bikes revolve with the idea of making the
bikes faster and faster.

Bikes used in cross country mountain biking can
be fully rigid frame, hardtails, or even full
suspension frames.  Through the years, the cross
over to full suspension has become very popular.

The weight difference between free ride bikes and
cross country bikes are considerable.  You'll be
extremely hard pressed to find a bike that weighs 
more than 24 pounds, and even that weight can be
heavy.  Free ride bkes weigh close to 40 pounds,
which makes the difference in weight pretty close.

If you've never tried cross country mountain biking,
you'll probably find it to be a break from the
ordinary.  Even though this type of biking involves
trails, it's normally the type of terrain that 
beginners wouldn't want to ride.  Involving hills
and rough terrain, cross country biking offers 
quite the rush.

For mountain bikers everywhere, cross country is
the way to go.  It offers you a new assortment of
bikes, new areas to bike, and a new twist to 
mountain biking as you know it.  If you've been
looking for a mountain biking rush, cross country 
mountain biking is what you need to be experiencing.
