Canon XLH1

On September 18 of 2005, Canon broke new ground in 
the digital video camera industry, announcing the
XL H1, which was Canon's first DVC featuring high
definition.  Originally developed based on the needs
of professional and enthusiast videographers, the
XL H1 retains the operability of Canon's very popular
XL2 while increasing the professional function and
supporting high definition recording.

The flagship DVC for the company of Canon, the XL H1
is ideal for use all across the spectrum of 
professional content making, from film and television
production to filming weddings.  The XL H1 also 
comes equipped with a HD 20X zoom video lens, the XL
5.4-108 mm L IS II, which contributes to Canon's 
development aim of delivering the highest possible
quality of recording available today.

As Canon's first HD video camera, the XL H1 camcorder
and 20X HD video zoom lens will provide broadcasters
with a low budget 1080i resolution option for ENG,
documentary or even reality television productions.

Film makes will also fall for the extensive Cine
controls and 24 frame rate option the XL H1 
has to offer.  Canon's custom jackpack features
include uncompressed digital HD-SDI output for
seamless integration into broadcast studios or high
quality image transfer to non linear editing systems.

The genlock feature will allow movie sets to 
easily synchronize camera settings across multiple
camcorders and SMPTE time codes will allow for
streamlined tape and edit management.

The XL H1 also offers three 1/3 inch 1.67 megapixel
interlaced CCDs that capture images at 1080i 
resolution.  It also features selectable frame 
rates of 50i and 25F, so capturing fast motion and
just about everything else is possible with the
XL H1.
