Start Your Day At Disneyland in Fantasyland

Any guidebook you read will tell you that you should 
begin your day at Disneyland enjoying the attractions 
found in Fantasyland. There are several important 
reasons as to why this advice is given, and it is 
advice that you should strongly consider following.

Fantasyland is one of the most popular areas at 
Disneyland because there are no age or size 
requirements. The only height restriction is a 35 
inch requirement for the Matterhorn. As the day 
progresses, Fantasyland will fill up. Getting there 
first thing in the morning will help you avoid the long 
lines that others will encounter later in the afternoon.

None of the attractions in Fantasyland have 
FastPass. This is another reason as to why you 
should go there first. FastPass allows you to more 
or less ‘set an appointment’ to ride certain rides – 
but none of the attractions in Fantasyland have this 
option. Cover Fantasyland first, then go get 
FastPasses for the other attractions that you want 
to ride.

The crowds and the lines will start growing within a 
few hours of Disneyland opening each day. Make 
sure that you arrive before the park opens so that 
you can be one of the first ones through the gate – 
and head straight to Fantasyland before going 
anywhere else. 

Since all of the guidebooks suggest this, many 
other early risers will also be headed for Fantasyland. 
Even so, the lines won’t get really long for two or 
three hours, and by then, you will have already ridden 
all of the rides there.

From Fantasyland, you should start collecting 
FastPass tickets for the other attractions that have 
FastPass throughout the park. It is best to collect 
these early in the day – the longer you wait, the l
onger it will be before your appointed time comes 
around, depending on how many FastPasses have 
been issued for each ride. 

While you are waiting for the appointed time for your 
first FastPass, you should enjoy other attractions, 
visit the shops, or get a snack. Times between 
FastPass appointments are great for visiting the 
restrooms or sitting down to rest with a cool 
beverage. 

Just remember that in order to enjoy the most 
attractions at Disneyland you should start with 
Fantasyland, followed by gathering FastPass tickets. 
Enjoy other attractions between FastPass attractions, 
but make sure that you don’t put yourself on such a 
tight schedule or such a rigid itinerary that you forget 
to have fun! Some people simply like to spend some t
ime wandering around the park.
