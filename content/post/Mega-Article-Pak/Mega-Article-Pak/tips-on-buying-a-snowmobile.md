Tips on Buying a Snowmobile

After deciding on the right snowmobile to fit your needs, the next step is to actually buy the snowmobile that you have determined is best for you. Many snowmobilers prefer to buy a used model rather than investing a larger amount of money into a new machine that they might not enjoy for more than two or three months out of the year. Following are some tips to remember when planning on purchasing your next used snowmobile

The most important thing to remember when buying a used snowmobile is to not buy the very first one you see. When looking for a snowmobile, look at several different ones before buying one so you can get a variety of ideas about what is available and decide which one is the best one to fit your needs. Before going to a stranger’s house to look at the snowmobile that they are selling, practice inspecting a friend’s snowmobile. Pretend that your friend is the stranger and inspect their machine with as much scrutiny as you would one that belongs to a stranger. Bring a friend along with you that knows a little bit about snowmobiles, too. This will keep you from making rash decisions and help you inspect things you might otherwise miss. Your friend can also help you load the snowmobile into your trailer if you decide to buy one.

If you are planning on going to a person’s house to inspect their snowmobile, tell them not to warm up or even start the snowmobile before you arrive. You will want to start it yourself to see how easy or difficult it is to get the engine going from a cold start. If the engine is already warmed up when you arrive, it will undoubtedly start easier and you will not get an accurate idea of how long it takes to start the engine or warm it up. In case you decide to take one of the snowmobiles for a test ride, bring your gear along, too. 

Before deciding on a used snowmobile, check with the local snowmobile dealerships, too. This will help you get an idea of how much you should expect to pay for certain models and if the ones you are planning on considering are overpriced. Inspecting the models at local dealerships will also give you a better idea on what snowmobiles look like when they are in good condition. A used snowmobile’s appearance can often be a good indicator about how well the machine has been taken care of. Make sure the snowmobile is symmetrical and that the skis are straight. The cosmetic appearance also tells a lot about how well the snowmobile has been kept up.

Ask the seller questions. What was the snowmobile used for? If it was used for racing, there could be added stress on the engine and its components which will shorten its lifespan. Ask about its specific model. Certain models have had many mechanical problems and drawbacks, which might even be why the seller is trying to get rid of it. Ask the seller if the vehicle has been crashed, too. A restored snowmobile might encounter serious problems in the very near future so it might not be a wise investment. Check for scrapes and cracks that can be tip-offs that the snowmobile has been in a serious accident or, at the least, poorly maintained and cared for.

Lastly, take the snowmobile for a test ride before making a final decision. Check the brakes to see if the work properly. They should engage smoothly and you should not be able to move the tracks back and forth until the brakes are disengaged. Look at the brake fluid, too. Make sure there is the proper amount of fluid in the reservoir and the color should be light amber. Any other color will indicate that the brakes have had problems and you could encounter even more brake problems shortly after purchasing the snowmobile. 

Buying a used snowmobile can be an exciting yet intimidating experience. Depending on the amount of research that you put into the purchase, you could be making a wise investment in future recreational opportunities for you and your family. Remembering these tips and making rational and educated decisions are important steps in buying the right snowmobile that will fit your specific needs.
