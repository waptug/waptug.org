The GE Monogram Wine Chiller ZDW24A

As many already know, General Electric (GE) produces a number of quality appliances. These range from kitchen products such as refrigerators and ovens, to utilities like water heaters and air conditioners. GE also has a special lineup called the GE Monogram Collection which offers both an aesthetic quality for home décor, as well as reliable appliances that GE is known for. But are these Monogram items worth the expensive price? We'll take a look at the GE Monogram Wine Chiller ZDW24A and see if it's worth its salt.

As advertised by GE, the GE Monogram Wine Chiller ZDW24A has a capacity of up to 50 wine bottles. It has a temperature control that can be set from 40-60 degrees Fahrenheit. There is an interior light and a see through glass door that stylishly shows off the contents of the wine chiller. The wine chiller also has 7 racks that can slide out for easy storage and access to your wine bottles.

It sounds like a nice item, but how does the GE Monogram Wine Chiller ZDW24A really measure up? Being a luxury item, you would hope that this wine chiller delivers it in spades. It certainly would be a nice item to have for a wine connoisseur, or at least someone who's really into wine. Unfortunately, the ZDW24A model is no longer available. Instead, make way for the GE Monogram ZDWC240NBS Wine Chiller.

There isn't much difference in functionality between the ZDW24A and the ZDWC240NBS wine chillers; only the appearance is remarkably distinguishable. Averaging a base price of around $1000, is this wine chiller worth having? Although the look is top-notch, you might run into a problem.

When you put the wine chiller to use, the shelves appear to be too close together to actually store standard sized wine bottles. If you try to store your wine, the labels of the bottles will start to tear and rip. This friction against the shelves is rather inconvenient, but the standard space between each shelf can be widened. If you have a wine bottle that is too big to fit, you can remove one shelf to accommodate its size. You may lose a little efficiency with space, though.

The GE Monogram wine chiller looks really nice, and it doesn't make a lot of noise. It does its job of storing and cooling wine bottles, and it does it with style. If you need a wine chiller, this is a good choice if you can deal with the shelf space issue. Although the GE Monogram Wine Chiller ZDW24A and the ZDWC240NBS share the same functionality, you might favor the appearance of one over the other. 

You might not have much of a choice, though, as the ZDW24A is no longer being manufactured. That means it's less available than the newer model. Just make sure that your wine bottles can fit, and you shouldn't have any problems with either model. There are also other models available, so don't be afraid explore the other appliances that GE Monogram has to offer.
