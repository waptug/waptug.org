Disney Dollars and Disneyland Merchandise Cards

When it comes to kids and money, we all know what 
happens. The money either gets spent the wrong way, 
or it gets lost. With Disney Dollars and Disneyland 
Merchandise cards, you may be able to cut down on 
some of this.

Disney Dollars work just like cash at Disneyland. 
They can be used anywhere in the park, and at 
certain hotels. They can even be used at local 
Disney stores in your area. The Disneyland 
Merchandise Card works more like a credit card. The 
amount of money you load on the card is how much 
is available. All of this fits quite nicely into the 
FreePass holder, so there will be less chance of 
losing the dollars or the card.

You can also purchase a Disneyland Resort Gift 
Card. This card can only be used at the Disney 
Resorts, as well as stores that accept credit cards 
at Disneyland. These cards also make great gift 
items for anyone who loves Disneyland, or for 
anyone who is planning a trip to Disneyland. This is 
a great way to budget money for souvenirs as well 
as snack items while at Disneyland.
