Aspen Nightlife – The Caribou Club

According to The New York Post, the Caribou 
Club is the absolute best private club in 
America. This is a member’s only private club, 
and the membership fee is quite high – but the 
ambiance is top-notch!

The Caribou Club is located in Aspen, 
Colorado on East Hopkins Avenue. The club 
is open from 6:30pm until 2am every day, and 
you can enjoy dinner and dancing, or lounge in 
the Great Room before a roaring fireplace with 
a fine cigar. The wine cellar houses over 5000 
wines from around the world. 

There is more to The Caribou Club than fine 
dining and dancing, however. When you enter 
the club, you are entering a world of elegance 
that can only be experienced here. The walls 
are covered with 19th century paintings. There 
is a coat room, where your coat will be taken 
from you, and you are made to feel like a very 
welcome houseguest. You can then go to the 
bar, the Great Room, or be seated for dinner 
– the choice is yours.

The Caribou Club has only been open for about 
ten years, but it has become an integral part of 
Aspen nightlife for the rich and famous – and 
even for those who are not famous, nor rich, 
but who can afford to pay the membership 
fees. When you enter the Great Room at The 
Caribou Club, you will probably see faces that 
you know – even if you don’t know these 
famous people on a personal level.

You don’t even have to be in Aspen to enjoy the 
cuisine offered by The Caribou Club. Your 
event can be catered by the club, no matter 
how large or small it is, or where it is located. 
You can have your event catered anywhere 
in the world! Private parties can also be held 
at The Caribou Club.

Again, the cost is fairly high. Lifetime 
membership for a couple is $10,000. Individual 
membership for two people is $3000 for the 
first year, and $1000 for each additional year, 
paid annually. Family membership for up to five 
people costs $4000 per year. A temporary 
membership is available for one week. The cost 
is $500 and covers one couple. However, during 
Holidays and President’s Weekend, the cost is 
$1000. 

As you can see, The Caribou Club is quite 
exclusive – but depending on the type of
 nightlife you enjoy, the cost of membership is 
well worth it – even if you only visit once a year.
