The evolution of iPods – from their appearance to the iPod video

	
The newest and most popular innovation in iPod technology is, for sure, the iPod video. Still, getting to this innovative device is just the result of a long research through the history of the iPod making. 
	
The appearance of the iPod was owed to an increased marketing request: the lack of quality of the digital music players was noticeable to the interested consumers, as opposed to the growing number of digital devices, such as cameras, camcorders and organizers. Due to this fact, the Apple industries established a team of qualified engineers in order to develop the mechanism and design of the soon to be first iPod, which resulted in less than a year of technical and practical research. The launching of the new and exiting product was held on the 23rd of October 2001 and soon, the market embraced the new product. The evolution from the first iPod, which was revealed almost 5 years ago, till the iPod video reveals the intense and permanent research of the specialized engineers. The next significant step in the evolution of this device was the release of the 2 versions iPod, for both Mac and Windows users, which highly increased the sales and the number of potential customers. Actually, the iPod sold at such a high rate, that the permanent improvement of the product, in order to maintain the leading position on the market, was a necessary request (the selling rate recorded over 42 million units since the release of the product). 
	
In 2005, the new and better iPod was revealed, when celebrating the 4th generation of these devices; the new model introduced, for the first time, the color screen. In the spring of 2006, the Samsung company announced that they were about to provide the media processor for a new iPod model, an improved version of the Apple’s device. Soon after, the 5th generation of iPods introduced the iPod video, meaning it has video playback capacities, video playing and better organization features. The launching was celebrated together with the innovative new models of iPods: the iPod nano, with color screen and the iPod shuffle, which were the best sellers of 2005.  
	
The 5th generation of the iPod was about to reveal many new and exiting features of the small device, all under the slogan One more thing... Basically, the iPod video or the video iPod was available on the market in both 30 GB and 60 GB capacity models, had ability to play both MPEG-4 and H.264and much higher resolution, up to 480/480. Having a 16-bit color screen and being able to display all kinds of videos on a TV set, the new product was a market hit since its appearance. Regarding the design, the new iPod comes, as the previous iPod (the nano model of the 4th generation) in 2 colors, white and black, but it has a multitude of applications and improved features: World Clock, Stopwatch, and Screen Lock applications, a smaller earphone, a thin slipcase, AC adapter and FireWire cable. Regarding the dimensions, the new iPod is 4.1 x 2.4 x 0.43 inches for the 30 GB version and 4.1 x 2.4 x 0.55 inches for the 60 GB version (which, in the case of the new model, are marketed at the same price). The screen size was modified to 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) diagonally, 0.5 inches (12.7 mm), meaning that the video iPod screen is larger than the previous one. Even more, the product is thinner than the last model, iPod nano, and the battery life increased from 16 hours to 20 hours. Still, being a video device, watching movies reduces the life of the battery to around 2 to 3 hours. 
	
With an exiting and evolving history, the iPod manages to be one of the most innovative products on the digital devices` market, with millions of customers all around the world and increasing sells.
