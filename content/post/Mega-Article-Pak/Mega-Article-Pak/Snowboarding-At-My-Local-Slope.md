Snowboarding At My Local Slope

My local ski slope is quite a fun place to hang out for me and my teenage friends. We find that it’s a good way to keep ourselves amused. You see in my local area when you are under 21 their really is nothing else to do. You see me and my friends can’t go out drinking and nor do we have any particular desire to hang out at the local tennis court, that is why we were looking for something to do that was knew, exciting and more suited to our need for extreme entertainment!

So we went down the local ski slope and asked some questions about what kind of thing goes on and basically tried to get a grasp for how much it was going to cost to get started. The lady was really helpful and seemed to be really encouraging. She explained that we would not need a snowboard, snowboarding boots or even snowboarding skills to get started. We were really pleased to here it, so basically asked if we just went on the slope or if we needed some kind of tuition first. The lady explained that we would definitely need some kind of tuition first, and explained that for $15 an hour we could get a group lesson. This was kind of what we were looking for, as the idea was to do this as a group and we felt that if we all done it together It would be more of a laugh. So we basically booked a lesson, and the lady explained that we had to pay a deposit because the slope had to arrange it with the instructor.  She explained that we would get lessons for around 5-10 hours and then she thought that we would be good enough to come down the slope on our own and try things out. This was the kind of thing that I was looking to do, because we wanted more than merely to learn. We wanted to pick up the basic skills that were required and then come down on our own and have a laugh at the slope.

So we went to the lessons and they worked out great. They were really fun for everyone involved. It turned out that it wasn’t just us at the lessons, but the other girls and boys who went to the lessons were all really easy to get on with and everyone got on well. Nobody had been to snowboarding lessons before so we were all kind of in the same boat so to speak. The teacher went over really basic stuff at first, and to be honest I did not pay too much attention because I was more concerned with actually going out their and starting to ski for real. The guy who was our teacher was really approachable and that just made it so much easier for everyone. We were able to ask all the questions we wanted, and he seemed to pick up when someone was having problems and when we understood things. He then explained after around 30 min’s that we were ready to hit the slopes, and you can be sure that we were ready, I was practically desperate to hit the slopes and get started. At first, he asked us to go down the beginner slope which is basically a slope that is for people who are just starting to learn. The gradient is much less and that makes it so much easier to get going, because if you build up to much speed and you do not know how to stop then that could cause real problems for a beginner.
