The Many Styles Of Kung Fu

The martial art known as Kung Fu is very old, yet very powerful.  There are several different forms involved with Kung Fu, that only add to the power and mystique.  Below, we will go over a majority of the different styles and forms that make up Kung Fu.

White Crane style
The spirit of the White Crane has led to what many martial artists consider to be the most graceful system of Kung Fu.  The pattern for the White Crane style was patterned after a crane bird often found in marshes and open plains.  The White Crane defense forms and attacks are nothing short of amazing, often known as “deadly beauty”.

Although the techniques within the White Crane style can take years to properly master, they simple and to the point.  White Crane stylists are masters of self defense, although they are taught to avoid confrontations.  Even though a stylist can handle himself in any situation, he will avoid a fight at all costs and only react with physical action when he is left with no choice.

Wing Chun
From a Chinese standpoint, Wing Chun is the essence that the opponent will attack, absorb, and then neutralize the attack.  Then, the opponent or attacker will back off, pursue, then counter - disengage his restriction from arms, and then retaliate with a deadly and penetrating force.

This philosophy will take years to fully understand, and years of practice to master.  Technically speaking, Wing Chun uses a steady and never ending forward flow of energy that’s based on the principle that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points.

Offensively, Wing Chun is all about a combination of intercepting and straight lines with deflecting arcs.  In general, it is an aggressive close quarter style that pushes offensive attacks and takes the fight right to the attacker.  In other words - Wing Chun doesn’t care nor does it put a lot of time towards the more traditional block and counter routines.

Hung Gar
Hung Gar is more or less an adaptation of the Tiger system of Shaolin that emphasizes close quarter techniques.  Hung Gar isn’t much on distance fighting, although it is very effective in close quarter situations, such as alleys and in small rooms.  It is a very strong system, teaching stylists to handle themselves properly in areas where other martial arts seem to fail.

Praying Mantis
Nearly 400 years ago, a man named Wang had a vision.  Using a praying mantis that he was able to capture, Wang studied it’s movements.  By using what he saw, he created and founded the style of Praying Mantis.  Wang perfected his own martial art style by continuing to observe both the offensive and defensive movements of the praying mantis, and using them with his style.

The Monkey style
Even though it is thought of a comical approach to martial arts, the Monkey style is actually one of the deadliest martial arts systems in the world.  This style dates back to the 1840s, when missionaries were first allowed passage into China.

The Monkey style all began when a peaceful maned named See resisted arrested after accidentally killing an officer of the law.  See was sentenced to prison for his crime, where he spent all of his time watching the prison apes.  He found them amazing, and would watch them from his cell, which his also helped to pass the time.

Over his ten year prison sentence, he studied the way the apes moved, paying very close attention to how they defended themselves and fought each other.  Then, when he was released from prison, he adapted his style, becoming known as the Monkey Master.  A lot of people joined him along the way, and began to learn his Monkey system which is still very effective today.
