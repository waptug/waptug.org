Buying Private Label E-book Resell Rights versus Writing Your Own

In today’s society, there are many individuals who are looking to make money anyway that they can. In many cases, these individuals are looking for opportunities that allow them to work at their own pace or be their own boss.  If you are one of those individuals then it is possible that you may have thought about creating and selling e-books.

The popularity of e-books has rapidly increased over the past few years now.  Many readers are not only finding it convenient to purchase them, but cheaper.  In most cases, e-books are easily to read on the computer, but they can also be printed off. Since more and more consumers are interested in purchasing e-books, there are more individuals who are looking to make money off of them. If you are able to do this, you may find success; however, that success will not come without hard work.

If you have never created an e-book before, it is difficult to understand exactly how much hard work it entails.  To be worth the buy, most e-books are at least one hundred pages long; however, some are longer.  If you are interested in creating an e-book, it may take months for you to finish the book. In addition to hard work, you must also have writing experience and knowledge on the topic that you are writing about. This knowledge and experience isn’t necessarily necessary; however, it is important to the success of your e-book.  It is a fact that customers do not and will not purchase poor quality work.  

In addition to writing a quality e-book, you will also have to find ways to sell it. Together, the two could take a large amount of time. For many individuals, this is a major turn off; however, there are alternatives.  If you are interested in selling e-books, to make a profit, you do not necessarily have to create your own.  Instead you can obtain the private label resell rights to another e-book.  Obtaining the resell rights to an e-book will allow you, in many cases, to assume to the work as your own, edit the content, and pocket the money from each sale of the book.

The biggest downside to obtaining the resell rights to an e-book is the amount of money that you will have to spend.  Depending on who you do business with, the cost of acquiring private label resell rights may be fairly expensive. Since most freelance writers spend a large amount of time creating their e-books, as previously mentioned, they may want to appropriately be compensated. The cost of resell rights to an e-book may be considered a disadvantage to this unique business opportunity, but it can also be considered an advantage.  E-book authors that charge more for their work typically have produced better content; better content is easier to sell.

Whether you make the decision to develop your own e-book or purchase the resell rights to someone else’s, you will still have to find a way to market the e-book to the general public.  This, depending on what approach you take, can take time. That is why many individuals prefer purchasing the resell rights to an e-book that has already been created.  This allows them to spend more time on marketing, which will in turn create sales.  

If you are unsure as to whether or not you should create your own e-book or obtain the resell rights to another, you are not alone. There are a number of other individuals wondering the same thing.
