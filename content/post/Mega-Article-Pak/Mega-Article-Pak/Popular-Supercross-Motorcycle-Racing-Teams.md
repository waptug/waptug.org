Popular Supercross Motorcycle Racing Teams

Are you a fan of supercross motorcycle racing?  If so, there is a good chance that you are already familiar with some of the most popular supercross motorcycle racing teams.  If you are not, it is likely that you would like to famialrize yourself with them, especially if you are interested in becoming a full-time fan of the sport. As with just about any sport, you will find that supercross motorcycle racing has a number of different teams, which in a way can also be considered sponsors.

One of the most popular and well known supercross motorcycle racing teams is that of Honda. Honda is most well known for its production of vehicles. These vehicles range from everyday cars to motorcycles, including off-road motorcycles.  Perhaps, that is one of the reasons why Honda started their own supercross motorcycle racing team.  The most popular supercross racer to partner with Honda has been Jeremy McGrath. Although Jeremy McGrath is planning on retiring near the end of 2006, he, Honda, and a number of other sponsors are planning on going out with a bang.  That bang is the Jeremy McGrath Invitational, which is scheduled to take place in early October of 2006.

Like Honda, Kawasaki is another maker of off-road motorcycles. They have also developed the Kawasaki supercross racing team.  This team comprises of a couple of well known riders, including James Stewart. James Stewart was recently crowned the 2006 World Supercross GP Champion.  In addition to the 2006 champion, James Stewart, the Kawasaki team also includes Michael Byrne.

Suzuki, also another maker of a number of different vehicles, including off-road motorcycles, is another supercross motorcycle racing team. That team comprises of Ricky Carmichael and Ivan Tedesco.  Although Ivan Tedesco’s accomplishments shouldn’t go unnoticed, Ricky Carmichael is known as one of the best supercross riders of all times.  In fact, he has gone on to win a number of championships.  This popular and well performing rider is often compared to the great Jeremy McGrath.

In addition to Honda, Kawasaki and Suzuki, Yamaha is another popular and well known manufacturer of off-road motorcycles. In fact, if you enjoy off-road biking at your home, there is a good chance that you own a Yamaha off-road motorcycle. Their motorcycles are often considered the most popular on the market. Aside from manufacturing a number of off-road motorcycles, Yamaha is also known as being a supercross motorcycle racing team. This team comprises of Chad Reed and Heath Voss.  Out of the two riders, Chad Reed is the most well known, not only in the United States, but all around the world.  

As you may already know or assume, the riders of each time race a motorcycle from the team that they are with. For instance, Chad Reed, a member of Team Yamaha, races a Yamaha bike and so on.  These bikes are not always like the bikes that you can find at your local recreational sports store. In fact, many of these bikes are specialty bikes, made just for supercross motorcycle racing.  However, this does not mean that you will not have access to one of those bikes.  For example, Suzuki is currently offering a replica of Ricky Carmichael’s 2006 supercross bike. Many other motorcycle teams and companies are beginning to follow suit.

In addition to the above mentioned teams, you will also find that many of these teams and riders have different sponsors.  These sponsors tend to include those that sell racing parts, as well as everyday products, such as food or drinks. By familiarizing yourself with the most popular supercross motorcycle racing teams, you will be more informed, when it comes to exercising your knowledge of the sport.
