Motorcycle Racing

Motorcycle racing is a very exciting sport that many people love to watch. The three main types of motorcycle racing include dirt bikes, street racing, and drag racing. Each offers motorcycle enthusiasts the opportunity to race their motorcycle at breath taking speeds against the best in the sport. Those who have proven to be among the best are able to secure sponsors to help cover the cost of their racing activities. While some of the biggest payouts are in motorcycle street racing, this is very illegal. 

Dirt bike racing is generally called motocross or supercross. Motocross racing involves a dirt track with some tight turns. Supercross is mainly done indoors in arenas or event centers. This type of racing involves some spectacular jumps and moves to get an edge over the competition. This type of racing is very fast paced and exciting to watch. The race track is often made of dirt and sometimes there are mud pits as well for added difficulty and entertainment for the crowd.

One main difference with this type of racing is that all of the racers start at the same time, so you often have 25 or more racers jammed together at the start. Getting a good start in this type of racing will give you an edge over the competition. Many of the racers get jumbled together in the first turn, making it hard to pull ahead of other racers. 

Drag racing involves racing at extremely high speeds for a short distance on straight pavement. The distance is generally either a quarter mile or a half mile. There are two types of drag racing for motorcycles. The first is called bracket racing. This involves time trials and then attempting to get as close to your dial in time without breaking out. This type of racing is more about being consistence than racing other competitors. In heads up drag racing, the competitor’s race against each other and the first one to reach the finish line wins. 

Motorcycle street racing is illegal, but a very popular past time for many in California and Florida. There is a great deal of money to be made in illegal street racing so there are always plenty of participants. There are also spectators who enjoy the thrill of this type of racing. While police work hard to prevent such racing from taking place it is still taking place. Strict penalties are being put into place as a deterrent for those who continue to participate. 

Some other popular types of motorcycle racing include hill climbing. This involves a motorcycle racing to the top of the hill. While each rider has the entire track to themselves, their times are ranked against those of other riders. Rally racing involves competitors on a geographical racing trail, with various checkpoints along the way. 

Motorcycle racing is a sport many people love to participate it. There are many spectators who enjoy the fast pace and action taking place throughout the races as well. Some people participate in motorcycle racing as a hobby or for entertainment. For others, it is a way of life. They have worked hard to earn sponsors and follow the racing circuit from one racing event to another. They also put countless hours into learning new techniques on their motorcycles to stay in the top positions over the competition.
