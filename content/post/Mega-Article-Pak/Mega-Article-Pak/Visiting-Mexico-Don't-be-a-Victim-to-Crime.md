Visiting Mexico?  Don’t Be a Victim to Crime

If you are planning a trip to Mexico, there are a number of important factors that you should first consider and prepare for. These factors are considered safety precautions.  Traveling to Mexico is fun, but it can be also dangerous, especially if you don’t know what to do or how to protect yourself.

When visiting Mexico it is important to register with the United States Travel Registry to ensure that the government knows that you are leaving the country.  This is the first step to staying safe while in Mexico.  In the event that you become the victim of a crime, you will receive immediate government assistance.  When using the internet to register with the United States Travel Registry, be sure to leave a detailed itinerary of your plans on your computer.

You should also make sure that you leave information regarding your travel plans with a close friend, family member, co-worker, or neighbor.  You are encouraged to make copies of your airline tickets, as well as your passport. You want to take a copy with you and leave another copy at home.  This will help verify your location if something should go awry.  You should also designate someone you know as your emergency contact.  

Use common sense in the hotels, on busses, or walking in the streets of Mexico.  Don’t take taxicabs that you have just waved down on the streets.  Many crimes are being reported of people who haven’t previously arranged for taxis.  You should also never carry large amounts of cash, flashy jewelry, or extra credit cards with you.  When you are a tourist, shady people will already notice you and single you out.  Be on the lookout for and avoid these individuals at all costs.  

If you think that you know all there is to Mexico you are most often wrong.  Public drinking is often shown in films as the norm, however this is a crime and you can be arrested for being intoxicated in public.  You should also use caution when drinking in nightclubs or bars during the evening hours.  People who wish to victimize tourists often drug them.  

You should always use caution, no matter where you are. Despite being cautionary at all times, you should also use caution when traveling by bus and other forms of public transportation.  You should always stay alert during nighttime travel and while traveling during busy bus hours.  It is becoming more common for tourists to be mugged while riding on the busses in Mexico.  The busses where these crimes are taking place are often the cheapest forms of travel.  You may want to ride first class and have someone that you know and trust with you.

If you need help while in Mexico you should contact the United States Embassy.  There is also a twenty-four hour hotline for the Mexican Ministry of Tourism.  There is also a Mexican version of 911; it is 060 for Mexico City, and 066 for other areas of Mexico.  This will put you in contact with Mexican officials immediately.  There is also a Mexican Red Cross that will help if you are injured and need medical help.  The Red Cross is free of charge and they will provide basic medical attention.  

The above mentioned precautionary measures and important phone number are just a few of the many that you should know.  Despite what you believe, staying safe while on vacation in Mexico shouldn’t begin as soon as you arrive.  You should start taking precautionary measures before you leave for your vacation.
