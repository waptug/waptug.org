Looking At High Def Cameras

If you've been looking for a high definition video
camera, there are many out there for you to choose
from.  In this article, we will take a look at
some of your options available in each of the 
different formats.

HDV
JVC, Sony, and Canon all produce HDV cameras of
various stripes and abilities.  The JVC HD100U 
shoots 720p, offers a true 24p frame rate, and 
provides a professional looking form factor, along
with sporting the ability to change out lenses.

The two popular HDV cameras from Sony include the
HDR-FX1 and the HVR-Z1U.  Both of them shoot only
1080i and provide 24p.  The XL h1 is Canon's 
entry to the HDV roundup.  It provides HD SDI
output and gives you the option of interchanging
lenses.  Like Sony, it shoots 1080i without true
24p capabilities.

All of these cameras are 3CCD models and all 
sport level professional XLR audio inputs, with
the exception of the HDR-FX1.  Sony also offers
single chip HDV cameras.  The consumer HC1, 
which is actually a miniature version of the FX1
is an excellent camera.

DVCPRO HD
on the budget end of the Panasonic spectrum is the
AG-HVX200.  This widely hyped camera does away with
tape based HD recording and will instead record
HD to either memory cards or even an attached hard
drive.  It also offers the ability to shoot all 
the above mentioned HD resolutions along with 50
and DV25.

Another popular camera for Panasonic is the Varicam
which shoots at 720p.  A great feature with this
camera is the ability to shoot at variable frame
rates, which range from 4 - 60fps at 1fps intervals.
These different frame rates will allow you to 
achieve a look similar to that of over cranking a
film camera.  

HDCAM
Sony couples their HDCAM cameras together under 
the name CineAlta.  They cover a broad range of 
prices and features, ranging from the XDCAM HD
models and the F350 to the widely used and widely
popular F950.  

The XDCAM HD cameras record directly to Sony's
professional disc media, which is physically 
similar to Blu-ray discs.  These cameras can also
record various quality levels of 1080i and 1080p,
along with regular SD DVCAM.  Unlike other HD 
cameras from Sony, the XDCAM HD supports i-Link 
for file access and DV output.  

Near the high end of the Sony HD solutions is the 
F900.  It captures both 1080p and 1080i at 
various frame rates, including 25p and 50i.  This
is also the most expensive camera from Sony, as 
it costs around 80,000$!
