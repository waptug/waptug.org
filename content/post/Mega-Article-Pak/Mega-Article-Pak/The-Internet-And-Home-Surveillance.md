The Internet And Home Surveillance

In the past, many have often wondered how they can keep check on things at home while they were on a trip or vacation – hundreds of thousands of miles away.  These days however, keeping tabs on your home while you’re away is quite possible.  With the Internet and today’s technology – you can keep watch on your home no matter how far away you may be.

Although the technology may sound a bit out there at first, this day and age it certainly isn’t out of reach.  The hardware used for surveillance is inexpensive these days, and ready to use all over the world.  All it takes is someone with a bit of common sense and the curiosity to try new and exciting technology.

To use these types of equipment, you’ll need a reliable connection the Internet.  The Internet is the heart and soul of distance surveillance equipment, enabling you to keep a check on your home from hundreds of thousands of miles away.  If you are planning to invest in an Internet powered surveillance system, you should first make sure that you can get a high speed Internet connection to your home.  Dial-up isn’t recommended, as the speeds are far to slow to broadcast video.

There are two solutions that you can choose from, each one varying in features and complexity.  The first solution utilizes a personal computer.  Several home surveillance cameras are connected together to a system that will survey their areas and record what they see at either a set rate per second, or going by movement they detect.  Depending on the system you get, you may or may not be able to adjust these settings.

The computer will play back the video via the monitor, and record the video to the HDD, or hard disk drive.  You’ll need to connect the computer to the Internet through an ISP (Internet Service Provider), in order to watch the video from a distance.  To watch the video while you are away from home you will need to log into the computer with a unique username and password.  You can log in at any time, and to operate the computer or watch the video images that the computer surveillance system has recorded.

The other solution you have available is much easier.  Normally, this solution is used to check on a home through a single surveillance camera.  Setting things up this way will allow you to use a single camera through your IP (Internet Protocol) address.  By setting it up through your IP, all you need to do is check on things is to link directly to your IP.  Once you have brought up your IP address, you can see live views through the camera.  This method works similar to a webcam, in the sense that it streams video around the clock.

No matter which solution you choose, both are somewhat easy to use.  Of course the second solution is much easier to use and setup, although it does have it’s downsides as well.  Both have great things to offer you as well, including the ability to log in at any time.  You can check video any time you wish, even chance your preferences based on what you need.

Anytime you need to monitor your home from far away, home surveillance and the Internet is all you need.  The Internet is a common commodity these days, capable of doing far more than anyone ever thought possible.  By investing in a surveillance system that utilizes the Internet – you’ll be able to keep a watchful eye on your home from wherever the road takes you.
