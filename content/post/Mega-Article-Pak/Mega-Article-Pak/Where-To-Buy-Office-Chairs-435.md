Where To Buy Office Chairs

There are numerous places that you can buy office
chairs from.  You can buy from a dealer, direct, 
or even from a superstore.  There are however, a
few things that you should know.

Buying from a dealer
Many companies that purchase mid to high end 
furniture will go through a dealer to furnish
their office.  Dealers will normally sell chairs
from one of the three largest vendors, then 
compliment with a number of smaller lines.

The advantages of buying from dealers include their
ability to obtain many designs.  Businesses that
plan to order many office chairs will be able to
bring a few models into the office for evaluation
purposes.

Buying chairs direct
Buying your chair direct is an option for companies
that are interested in purchasing budget or middle
ranged office chairs.  Because direct vendors don't
have the high costs of maintaining showrooms, you'll
find office chairs to be priced 20 - 40 percent 
lower than the actual retail price.  When you 
purchase multiple chairs, the price will get even
better.

Keep in mind that buying direct means you won't be
able to try the chairs out before you make the
purchase.  If you plan to purchase office chairs 
through a vendor direct, be sure that you try out
at least one chair before you purchase several.  

Buying from superstores
A superstore will offer many advantages for companies
that buy office chairs.  They buy in bulk, which
allows them to sell their chairs at extremely low
prices.  In addition to this, chair models are 
available right there on the floor, which allows you
to try before you buy.  A superstore will often times
provide free and immediate delivery.

Despite everything they offer, superstores tend to
be a poor choice for many companies.  The furniture
that's on display is normally designed for a home 
office, and therefore doesn't offer the comfort and
durability of the better designs and models.  In
addition to this, the selection often tends to be
limited.

If you happen to be looking for office chairs, any
of the above is great.  You can even look on auction
sites such as Ebay, or local trading newspapers as 
well.  Office chairs are popular these days, with 
some being more well known than others.  With new
chairs coming out all the time, the perfect chair 
for you is out there and waiting.

All you need to do is decide which method of buying
is best for you company and your needs.  There are 
many available methods, all you have to do is find
which one has the best quality office chairs for
the price.
