Snowmobiling is a winter activity that can be enjoyed by friends and families in both the United States and Canada. Alberta, Canada is one of the premier Canadian provinces where snowmobiling is a major pastime of resident and vacationers alike. The country’s consistently snowy weather and frigid conditions make for the landscape being almost constantly covered with ideal powder for snowmobiling and other winter activities for those who appreciate the winter season.
