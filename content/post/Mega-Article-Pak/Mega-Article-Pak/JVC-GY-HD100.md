JCV HY-HD100

At first look, the JVC HD100 looks like any other
high definition camera with a lot of switches, dials,
and places to plug in peripherals.  In operation, it
functions like an old regular video camera.  You 
don't really need to do anything special to make a
high definition recording, just press a button -
although there are differences.

One of the things that makes this camera so nice and
unique is the amount of control you have over pretty
much everything you record.  JVC really outdone 
themselves here, as you can record all of your settings
on a SD memory card and save them to move on to 
another JCV camera, which will save you a lot of time.

Another amazing feature enables the video camera to
automatically record to a hard disk while at the same
time recording to a tape. Recording directly to a 
hard drive will save you a lot of time in the editing
process, as you can immediately begin using your 
video without having to capture tape to your computer,
which can only be done in real time.

Surprisingly enough, the camera is very easy to use 
either mounted on a tripod or on your shoulder.  The
shoulder pad is a nice addition, being thickly padded.
To make things even better, the camera is very light.

When it comes to the quality, the GY-HD100 needs to
be seen to be believed.  HD video is intended to look
like real life.  There is an extended gray scale, a
heightened sense of color - and the resulting detail
is simply incredible.

HD at this incredible level has 720 X 1028 lines of
progressive video, which means that the video is shot
in one entire frame at a time.  Also, it can be
recorded at 24 or even 30 frames per second.

The 24 fps resembles film and if you plan to convert
to film, it's a great way to shoot - as you can 
quickly and easily go directly to film.  The 30 fps
has more data per second, although it is not
appropriate for making a film project.

If you want to experience HD without spending over 
70,000$, then the JCV GY-HD100 is more than worth
your time and money.  Even though it doesn't record
uncompressed HD video, it does record a picture 
that is far superior to the standard picture you get
with an average everyday camera.  HD is rapidly
becoming the future, and with the GY-HD100 - its here
and now.
