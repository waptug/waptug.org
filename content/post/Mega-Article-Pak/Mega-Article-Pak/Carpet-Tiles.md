Carpet Tiles

Anytime it involves your floors, you shouldn't limit
yourself to just carpet, but try the newer carpet
tiles instead.  Carpet tiles are available in an
array of designs and a great choice of materials
as well.  Bordered, geometric, contemporary, or
bamboo - will give your floors a complete makeover
and a great look as well.

When you go out to buy carpet tiles, you'll need 
to think about where you plan to install them.  
The tiles will vary in density as well as thickness.
Carpet tiles with more thickness have a cushion
so that it's soft on the surface, making them ideal
for homes.  They will also provide a degree of
thermal insulation as well.  The thinner types of
tiles are best for offices, gyms, and other high
traffic areas.  All carpet tiles are easy to 
maintain and will last you for a long time.

The tiles will come in a variety of materials and
patterns.  If you choose, you can make your home
a greenhouse by using bamboo carpet tiles, or you
can choose terracotta carpet tiles that will 
give your interior an earthly feel.

You may just want to liven things up a bit or
play down your floor, depending on the look you
are going for.  Carpet tiles that are made from
foam, rubber, linoleum, and vinyl are best for
children's rooms, office spaces, or other high
traffic areas.  The cost for the tiles will
depend on their thickness and density, which
means that the prices can range from 1$ per square
foot up to 40$ per square foot.

Tiles for carpet will offer you several advantages
when you compare them to wall to wall carpets.
They are easy to install and easy to transport,
as you can install them without having to move
any furniture!  They are very durable as well,
and will last longer than most types of carpet
even when they are used in high traffic areas.

You can also unleash your creative side as well
with carpet tiles.  You can mix and match
different tiles, or use a color for the border
and even create a distinctive look using 
various patterns.  Unlike wall to wall carpet,
you don't need any professional help in case
of tear, wear, or staining.  If they become
torn or stained, just replace that tile with a
new one.

There are carpet tiles available to fit each
and every taste, even budget and furnishings style
as well.  As they are less expensive, they will
offer you the chance to experiment with your
interior.  Pretty much the same with carpets, 
the installation of tiles is very important.

They must be installed on hard surfaces, such as
stone, cement, or ceramic tile.  The surface has
to be smooth and clean, so the adhesives will
last and your floor will have a well finished
look.  The carpet tiles will normally have cushion
or padding already installed, which will reduce
the cost and extend the life of the carpet.
