A Cabin Theme for Your Home Decorating Needs

When it comes to home decorating there is one thing that must be said-people seem to long for the simple life and cabin living. Of all the styles of decorating and décor this is one that seems to be repeated most often but in different ways. Seriously there are all kinds of 'cabin' décor websites, magazines, brochures, books, and how to videos all over the place than probably any other style of decorating.

One reason for the phenomenal popularity of this particular type of home decorating style probably has a little bit to do with the simplicity of it. There are no hard and fast rules, there aren't fancy faux finishes and textured painting that needs to be done in order to complete the look and there aren't overly complicated rules for what is and isn't acceptable. From the bear budget to the champagne and caviar crowd there is some sort of décor available that will suit not only the home decorating needs but also the need for quality as well. 

Another thing that many find appealing about a cabin themed home decorating plan is that it simply exudes warmth year round. From the dark colors to the flannel materials and the soft homespun simplicity of the design many find it simply irresistible. One thing that is obvious in this style of decorating is that it appeals to those who love home and hearth and warmth and good will far more than modern touches and design elements. This is not a hard plastic sort of design style and it shouldn't endeavor to become one as the two styles are almost systematically opposed to one another.

If you want the warmth of a Montana cabin in your home every day of the year this is one great way to do it. Bring the bears, the moose, and all the furry forest friends to frolic in your living room, on your light fixtures, and in your dreams as you fall into restful sleep each night. From the bedroom to the bathroom and the kitchen in between the cabin style of home decorating is one that is making great waves in the market place. 

You will find many stores online and locally that cater to the cabin loving audience for hardware, knick-knacks, and what knots galore. The thing to remember is that the design essence isn't the little touches you add along the way, it's the warmth of wood, fire, leather, and wrought iron. These are the materials that will establish the cabin appeal more quickly than any of the little touches you can add along the way. Drywall and plaster simply cannot carry the look. Knotty pine or some other rich style of wood is the best option for walls when pulling off a cabin home appeal. 

More importantly than anything though is the need to include a little bit of yourself in the design. Do not hesitate to carve your initials with a heart into the wood of your walls. It is one more thing that will be not only endearing but also appropriate to the home and the atmosphere. There is a type of innocence about a cabin style home and the little touches such as that will leave a lasting impression.
