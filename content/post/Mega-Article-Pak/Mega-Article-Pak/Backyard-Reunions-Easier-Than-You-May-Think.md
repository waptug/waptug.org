Backyard Reunions: Easier Than You May Think

Family reunions are the times when many families come together. In some cases, they are only time that everyone in a family gets to see each other.  Unfortunately, it seems as if family reunions are becoming a thing of the past.  While family reunions still exist, they are not as popular as they once were.  Due to having children, busy sports schedules, and long work hours, many families are unable to have a family reunion, but you may be able to change that.

As previously mentioned, family reunions are difficult because everyone has their own, unique schedule.  Busy schedules are not the only reason why family reunions are becoming a thing of the past.  Family reunions are also difficult because many families do not know where to have them. Many public parks and campgrounds are now changing their guests. For many, these fees are difficult to afford. If location is what is preventing your family from having a reunion, you may want to consider your own backyard.

Even if you feel that a backyard family reunion will not work, you are still advised to give it some thought. After closely examining the advantages of disadvantages of having a backyard family reunion, you should be able to make an informed decision. Making informed decision is better than making one on impulse.

This means that not everyone lives in or around the same area. Instead of you having to travel, the rest of your family will have to. This may not only help to eliminate unnecessary travel expenses, but it is also convenient, especially if you have children.

Another advantage to planning your own backyard family reunion is that you will be in complete charge of the planning. How many times have you been to a party and wondered why the host did or didn’t do something? Planning your own family reunion will ensure that everything is just the way that you want it to be.

That, alone, is enough to make many homeowners want to plan their family’s next reunion.

While a backyard family reunion does have its advantages, there are disadvantages as well. One of those disadvantages may include the size of your yard or the size of your family. If you have a large family, but a small backyard, it may be impossible for you to host your next family reunion. However, that does not mean that a backyard reunion isn’t a good idea, it just means that you cannot be the host. Instead, you may want to consider speaking to your other relatives.  With your assistance, someone else may be willing to host the next family reunion.  

The cost of hosting a family reunion may not only be expensive, but it may exceed what you are able to afford. When you consider all of the food, drinks, snacks, and decorations are that are needed, it costs quite a bit to host this type of party. Despite the large cost, you may be able to turn this disadvantage into an advantage.  You can do this by seeking assistance from your other relatives. Whether you ask for financial assistance or a dish to pass, the cost of hosting a family reunion may significantly decrease.  

As with any party, including a family reunion, it is your decision as to whether or not you want to host one. By keeping the above mentioned advantages and disadvantages in mind, you may be able to decide whether or not a backyard family reunion is possible. If it is, you may not only enjoy the experience of planning your family reunion, but you may also enjoy seeing those that you haven’t seen in a while.
