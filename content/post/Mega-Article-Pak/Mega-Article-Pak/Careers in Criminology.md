Examining Careers in Criminology

Criminology may sound, initially, like a very concentrated field; however, the truth is that there are a number of different elements that play into the genre of criminology.  As a result, there are a number of different careers that an individual will be able to consider when they investigate the life and options of one who works in the field of criminology.  For all the many job opportunities and career paths that exist for those who are interested in the field, the field can be slightly difficult to break into for a person.  This is due in part to the fact that the inquiring person needs to be well-rounded when it comes to education, but also because the person does typically need a good amount of schooling in order to be considered as a qualified candidate for these types of jobs.

One of the most obvious careers that will typically pop into the minds of people who are thinking about crimes would be the profession of a police officer.  This is a very well respected field and does not require as much training and schooling as some other fields might.  Applicants will need to be tested in a number of ways prior to being offered a position, and in some more urban and populated areas there is a more desperate need for qualified police officers.  As a result, there is slightly more competition than there may be in a small town that is looking to hire police officers.

A drug policy advisor needs to do many things depending on their field of concentration.  Some of these advisors need to be able to look at trends and crimes over a period of time, and then weigh this information against the rest of the information that the individual has needed to research.  In some cases, this can include the number of deaths as a result of the drug and the number of violent crimes that have taken place in an area involving the drug as an instigator in the crime.  By looking at this information, and also at how much annually is spent on the drug for different demographics, a drug policy advisor can make some suggestions regarding the medication or drug.  Sometimes there are no negative repercussions as a result of the drug, but in other cases policies need to be put in place in order to place restrictions for the good of the public and the welfare of citizens.  

Other productive careers also include crime intelligence analysts, advocates on behalf of the consumer, private crime prevention leaders, and individuals that are working corrections.  These many careers require different and specific levels of schooling before the individual candidate can be seen as qualified for the job.  Cost of education varies depending on where an individual attends school in order to receive their education and how long they are required to their university.

Careers in Criminology are not just open within the United States for individuals, but are actually located in different areas around the world.  Different laws are established by different governments, so not all individuals qualified to work in the field of Criminology within the United States could do so in other areas of the world.  Still, individuals that are qualified in different areas can broaden their search options and range by looking at careers outside their geographic location.
