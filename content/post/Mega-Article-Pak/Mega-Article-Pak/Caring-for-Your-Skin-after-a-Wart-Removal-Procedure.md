Caring for Your Skin after a Wart Removal Procedure

When it comes to wart removal, a large amount of focus is placed on the removal itself. While it is important to focus on the actual removal process, it is also important to keep in mind what will happen afterwards.  If you are planning on having one of your warts removed, you are advised to examine the care that is needed, after your wart or warts have been removed.  

Perhaps, the first step in caring for your wound, which was likely created after your wart or warts were removed, is to know what you need to do.  If you are having your wart professionally removed, by a dermatologist or by your family doctor, you should be provided with detailed information. In addition to detailed information, there is also a good chance that you would also be sent home with supplies. These supplies may include, but are not be limited to, bandages, pads, and antibiotic cream.

Although you can receive the best after removal care advice from a physician, you may not be able to get that information. If you are performing your own at home wart removal, you will need to familiarize yourself with the proper ways to care for your wounds.  This can easily be done with the internet.  Online, you should be able to find a number of different medical websites. These medical websites are likely to contain information, tips, and advice for those who just had a wart removed. Of course, you are advised to be cautious and consider where you are getting your information from, but if it is from a reliable place, you will want to follow the instructions given to you.

Whether you get information, on caring for your wart wound, from the doctor who performed the removal or the internet, it is likely that you will be provided with similar instructions.  Perhaps, the most important instructions to follow is keeping your wounds clean.  Depending on the type of wound you have, which will also depend on the wart removal method used, you may have a small wound or scab. If this part of your skin is not properly cleaned, on a regular basis, it may become infected. In most cases, simple soap and water should be enough.

In addition to keeping your wound or scab clean, you will also want to keep it covered.  This will help, not only to keep it clean, but it should also prevent an infection from forming.  When covering the area, it should be enough to use a regular bandage.  It may also be a good idea to apply antibiotic cream on the spot. However, it is important to remember that some wart removers, such as some freeze-off wart removal products, caution you against using any skin creams, at least for a certain period of time.  It is not exactly sure why this is, but you are advised to follow all direction, especially if you purchase an over-the-counter wart remover. 

Once your wound has started to heal, a scab may begin to form and new skin may start to grow. When this occurs, it is important that you leave everything alone.  In fact, that is why it is advised that you always keep the area covered.  Picking or even touching the area could not only create an infection, but it could also hurt the healing process. If the healing process is interrupted, you may end up developing a permanent scar.  With wart removal, there is always a chance that a scar could develop, but it all depends.  To lesser your chances of having a scar, you need to refrain from messing with the scab or new skin that begins to develop.

If you notice any complications, such as a wound that will not heal or one that is extremely painful, you may want to consider seeking medical advice.  Although the problem may only be temporary or minor, it is still nice to be on the safe side.  Not everyone thinks about the complications associated with wart removal.  If you do, there will be a better chance of nothing going wrong.
