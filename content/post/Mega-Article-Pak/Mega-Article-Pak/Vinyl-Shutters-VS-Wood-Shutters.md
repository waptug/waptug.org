Vinyl Shutters VS Wood Shutters

Interior shutters have always been one of the most
popular window treatments.  They maintain their
value a lot better than any other type of window
covering, and they aren't only attractive and
enhance your home's appeal but they also help to
regulate light, insulate, and fit in to almost any
decorating style to make your window appear amazing.

These days, indoor shutters are more popular than
ever before.  Therefore, it's really no wonder why
many new manufacturers are trying to get into 
the shutter industry.  The most notable addition
is the vinyl compound shutters.

Wooden shutters
There are many reasons as to why you should avoid
using vinyl shutters.  Many prefer to have real wood,
just as they prefer clothing that is made from
cotton or wool as opposed to synthetics.  For a 
warm, authentic, traditional look, wooden shutters
are a great choice.

There are however some limitations of vinyl type
shutters.  They are normally made only in white and
off white colors.  Therefore, you can not precisely
color match, making staining impossible.  Most
interior vinyl shutters are cheaply made with cheap
components and poor quality, and should be avoided
for that reason - despite the low cost.

Vinyl shutters
Vinyl shutters of quality are definitely worth a
consideration.  The best types of interior vinyl 
shutters cost less than custom window shutters.  The
most important features are those that are practical
in nature.  Vinyl shutters won't crack, peel, fade,
or deteriorate like wood will.

Vinyl shutters are also perfect for humid areas such
as showers and sinks.  Since they are moisture 
resistant, they are also a great choice near the
swimming pool.  

They are also flame retardant and insulate much better
than interior wood shutters.  They are easier to 
clean and won't show any dents or scratches, which
makes them ideal for children's rooms.  The time
it takes to manufacture them is also half the time
of a true custom wood shutter.

Making that final choice between vinyl and wood all
comes down to the type of home you have and your
personal preference.  Each type certainly offers 
good and bad points, although wood is the most 
popular style.  Vinyl is quickly gaining in 
popularity, as they are much easier to clean than 
wood.

Before you make your decision, always compare and
shop around.  The prices will be different, although
you shouldn't base everything on price.  Check the
quality of the manufacturer and compare with the
types of windows you have.  Once you carefully put
some research into it, you'll have the windows you
need in no time at all.
