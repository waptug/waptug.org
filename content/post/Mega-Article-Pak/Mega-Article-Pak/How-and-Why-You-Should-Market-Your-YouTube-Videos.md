How and Why You Should Market Your YouTube Videos

Do you enjoy uploading videos that you made to the YouTube website?  If so, you may be pleased with all of the traffic that you get.  YouTube is known to get thousands of visitors a day.  For you, this means that your YouTube videos may be watched by thousands of people or more!  As much traffic as YouTube brings you and your videos, you may be looking for more.  If you are, you will want to examine other ways to market your YouTube videos.  Just a few of the many marketing approaches that you can take are outlined below.  

Perhaps, the easiest way to market your YouTube videos is to let friends, family members, or coworkers know that you have videos available for viewing on YouTube.  For the best chance of success, you are advised to email the direct links for your YouTube videos to those that you know.  If you just happen to mention having your videos on YouTube to a friend in passing, let them know what your videos are about or what your YouTube screen name is.  YouTube allows site visitors to browse through all of their videos or search for something in particular, like one of your videos.  

Another one of the many ways that you can market your YouTube video is by having any of your videos appear on any websites or blogs that you have.  What is nice about YouTube is that you can easily get a few HTML codes.  Those codes will enable you or any other internet users to post a YouTube video online.  It is not uncommon for bloggers to insert a YouTube video in their blog, by using generated HTML codes.  It is advised that you post your own YouTube videos on your own websites, but if you know of anyone else who has a blog, you may want to think about giving them the needed HTML codes to have your YouTube video appear on their blog.  In most cases, you will find that even strangers are willing to do so, as long as your YouTube video is connected, in one way or another, to their blog or website.
 
You can also market your YouTube videos on online message boards.  Online message board marketing can be done two different ways.  For instance, there are a large number of online message boards that let you discuss of share anything, in general, with other board members. You may want to think about posting links to some of your YouTube videos, especially if you think the other members would enjoy watching them.  If you belong to an online message board or forum that allows you to have a signature, you will want to look into doing so.  Your signature will always appear at the end of each of your messages; therefore, the more active you are online, the more exposure your YouTube videos are likely to get.  
	
Now that you know a few ways that you can go about marketing your YouTube videos to other internet users, you may be wondering exactly why you should.  As it was mentioned above, YouTube, alone, is likely to generate thousands of viewers for your videos.  If you are looking for more views, whether just to increase your online popularity or to help you get new clients, if you connect your YouTube videos to your business somehow, you will want to take the time to market your YouTube videos.  What is nice is that you have a number of different methods available, including the three mentioned above, and most are free.  In fact, marketing your YouTube videos to other internet users isn’t only free, but it is easy to.  Many marketing tactics will only take up a few minutes of your time, if even that.
	
The decision as to whether or not you want further market your YouTube videos is yours to make. If you find yourself unsatisfied or unhappy with your current YouTube viewer ship, you may want to think about doing a little bit of your own marketing.
