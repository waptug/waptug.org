Selecting the Proper Dance Shoes

If you've ever been to a wedding or prom in uncomfortable shoes you know the importance of this process. You absolutely must select comfortable shoes if you plan to be dancing for a long period of time. Having those gorgeous knock me dead heels is all well and good for the picture portion of your evening but when you're dancing you will want to be wearing shoes that you can actually move around in without wanting to cry. Besides who really wants to risk a mascara river for the after prom party? 

If you want to be sure whether or not your prom shoes will be comfortable for the big dance event try dancing around the house in them at all hours of the day and night. Make sure that there is no pinching, rubbing, or blistering as a result or your will spend the vast majority of your prom night sitting on the sidelines rather than dancing with your date. The same holds true for weddings. Pictures are all well and good, so is making that stunning entrance. At the same time there is nothing quite like being the last one standing when it comes to the dance floor. 

I am a firm believer in cute shoes. I am also a firm believer in having comfortable feet. Recommendations for heel height are that 2 inches are actually the best for providing arch support and foot health in addition to comfort. Yes, this means that this height is actually recommended over wearing flats. You'll also want to make sure there is plenty of room in the toe area so that your foot has a little breathing space without allowing room to rub and potentially blister. In other words a snug (but not tight) fit is preferable to shoes that fit loosely. You should have your shoes for the big event properly sized. 

If you just can't seem to part with the gorgeous 4 inch stilettos you found on sale as the perfect companion for your prom or wedding dress, then you should at least consider a back up pair of shoes that will be much more comfortable once the entrance has been make, the pictures have been taken, and you lose all sense of feeling in your feet. It is quite difficult to make complicated dance step when the voice in your head is screaming "Ouch! Ouch!" with every single step you make. Your shoes will actually affect almost every once of enjoyment you experience for the evening there is no reason you should wear uncomfortable shoes and be miserable for an evening that is supposed to be fun. 

You might want to check out dance stores in an around your hometown and see what they have to offer. They make shoes that are first and foremost designed to be danced in. They also make some very sassy shoes that are completely appropriate for formals and would be quite suitable to wear to a wedding or prom. You can find these shoes online though I recommend against this as you just can't get them properly fitted online and it doesn't matter how great they are designed if the shoes do not fit properly, they are quite likely to hurt your feet. The important thing is that you take the time to find shoes that you feel will be comfortable for dancing without sacrificing the look you are attempting to put together.
