In-Flight Air Travel Rules

When it comes to air travel, a lot of focus is placed on airport security. While the majority of air travel rules are enforced in airports, there are other rules that are enforced in the air. To make the most out of your next business meeting or vacation, you are advised to familiarize yourself with those rules.  Doing so will not only allow you to have a pleasant experience, but it will also prevent you from being involved in an unnecessary, but serious incident.  

As you may have gathered from news reports, one of the biggest problems on airplanes today is uncooperative passengers.  An uncooperative passenger can simply be one who needs to go to the bathroom and refuses to wait until it is safe to leave their seat. However, that passenger, along with many others, is largely unaware of the dangers of violating these important, but simple air travel rules.  The first rule that you must follow is to follow all rules imposed by your airline. This means leaving your seatbelt on until it is safe to remove it or staying in your seat until it is safe to move around.

It is also important that you cooperate with all airline employees, namely flight attendants.  If they ask you to do something, such as remain in your seat, you are advised to listen to them.  Often times, if you do not the situation will get out of hand. A few insulting comments and you could be met at your next boarding gate by airport security or local authorities.  Even if you do not consider yourself a threat to other passengers or flight attendants, confrontation in the air is taken seriously; very seriously. 

It is also advised that you refrain from making any jokes, especially those that involve the use of a bomb or any other weapons. Although you may only be kidding, in today’s society, these jokes are taken seriously.  In fact, it is advised that you refrain from using the words bomb, gun, or hijacking aboard an airplane. In the event that those words were overheard, whether they were taken out of context or not, they could cause you and other passengers a large hassle.  This hassle often involves the de-boarding of the airplane and additional security checks.

As previously mentioned, there are serous consequences for violating these air travel rules.  Even if it is proven that you are not a threat to yourself, the flight crew, or other passengers, you may still face prosecution. This prosecution may include disrupting the peace or inciting panic aboard an aircraft. Just because you know that you are not a threat, does not necessarily mean that everyone else knows the same thing. That is why it advised that you choose your words and your confrontations carefully, especially when in the air. 

The above mentioned in-flight air travel rules are just a few of the many that you must abide by. You will find that most of these rules are not well-kept secrets, in fact, many are simply common sense.  If you would like to learn more about the rules enforced in-flight, you are advised to contact each airline directly or use the internet to your advantage. A simple internet search should provide you with the information that you were looking to obtain.
