Universal Studios Tours - Behind The Scenes 

If you will be near Universal Studios on your next 
business trip or vacation, you should definitely make 
time for a Universal Studios Tour. This will not only 
provide you with a day filled with fun and excitement 
but you will also get a behind the scenes look at 
what it really takes to produce the Movies that we 
all wait anxiously to see.

If you are really interested in the world of movie 
making, don’t miss the Universal Studios Tour. The 
tour takes about one hour, and you will visit the sets 
of many famous movies and television shows. You 
will see the stars dressing rooms, and you may even 
run into a star or two along the way, or get to see an 
outdoors filming session in progress. 

The Special Effects Stage, located inside the park, 
is another attraction you won’t want to miss. Here, 
you will learn how Hollywood creatures are made, 
how sound effects are produced, and how visual 
affects are designed and implemented. This is an 
interactive attraction, and it only takes about thirty 
minutes to go all the way through it. Even though it 
doesn’t last long, there is a lot of information to be 
learned here – quickly! The interaction with the 
visitors makes this one of the most popular 
attractions at the park.

For the most exclusive and personalized look behind 
the scenes, you should definitely consider purchasing 
a VIP Studios Pass. This pass costs under $150 for 
one person, and it is worth every penny! This will 
entitle you to a private tour of Universal Studios, and 
you will be allowed in areas that standard tour visitors 
won’t see. You will also have the right to move right to 
the front of the line for all rides and attractions with the 
VIP pass. VIP passes can be purchased online, by 
telephone, or at the park – but they are limited to a 
certain number of VIP passes that are issued per day, 
so get yours as soon as possible.

Universal Studios is more than an amusement park, 
it is an interesting and amazing learning experience 
that you will never forget – no matter what age you 
are. The next time you watch an action movie, you 
won’t think ‘how did they do that?’ You will already 
have some idea as to how those special effects 
were created! You may even get so much out of 
your Universal Studios Tour experience that you 
think of ways that you could have done it better!
