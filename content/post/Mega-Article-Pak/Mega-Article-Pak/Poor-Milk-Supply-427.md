Poor Milk Supply

Almost all women don't have a problem with producing
enough milk to breast feed.  The ideal way to make 
sure that your baby is getting enough milk is to be
sure that he's well positioned, attached to the 
breast, and feed him as often as he gets hungry.

Some mom's that are breast feeding will stop before
they want to, simply because they don't think they
have enough breast milk.  

There are signs that might make you believe your baby
isn't getting enough milk.  If your baby seems hungry
or unsettled after feeding, or if he wants to feed
often with short pauses between feedings, you may 
think he isn't getting enough milk - which are often
times not the case.

There are however, two reliable signs that let you
know your baby isn't getting enough milk.  If your
baby has poor or really slow weight gain, or is
passing small amounts of concentrated urine, he's
not getting enough milk.

All babies will lose weight within the first few
days after birth.  Babies are born with supplies of
fat and fluids, which will help them keep going for
the first several days.  

Once your baby regains birth weight, he should begin
putting on around 200g for the first four months or
so.  To get back to their birth weight, it normally
takes a few weeks.

If the weight gain for your baby seems to be slow,
don't hesitate to ask your doctor or nurse to observe
you breast feeding.  This way, they can make sure 
that your technique is right and if they think your
baby is breast feeding often enough.

To help you with your breast feeding, here are some
ways that you can increase your supply of milk:
	1.  Be sure that your baby is positioned 
correctly and attached to your breast.
	2.  Let your baby feed for as long and often
as he wants.
	3.  If you feel that your baby isn't breast
feeding enough, offer him more breast feeds.
	4.  During each breast feed, make sure you
feed from both breasts.
	5.  If your baby has been using a dummy,
make sure you stop him.
	6.  Some babies may be sleepy and reluctant
to feed, which may be the cause of problems with 
milk supply.

By following the above tips, you'll do your part in
making sure you have enough milk when it comes time
to breast feed.  If you are uncertain or have other
questions, be sure to ask your doctor, as he can
answer any type of question you may have.
