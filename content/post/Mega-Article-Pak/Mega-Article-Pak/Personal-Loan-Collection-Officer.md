Personal Loan Collection Officer

Personal loans are a great way to obtain the funds you need to pay for many different financial endeavors including vehicles, home repairs, vacation, and education. It is important to pay back such personal loans as outlined in the terms of your loan. If you fail to do so, you will likely be hearing from a personal loan collection officer.

The job of a personal loan collection officer is not an easy one. They are human, so they will feel bad for the position many borrowers are in. However, it is their job to work hard to ensure the lending institution is repaid the money that was borrowed. It is in a borrower’s best interest to work with a personal loan collection officer from the very beginning. They are willing to help you find a solution that will work for both parties. However, if you refuse to answer their questions or return calls to discuss the reason for non-payment, they can’t help you. 

If the personal loan officer and the borrower can work out the issues with the payments, then both will go their separate ways. This may include the borrower catching up on the payments or the loan being re-written with lower payment amounts. Some lending institutions will waive late fees if the borrow agrees to discuss their finances with a financial counselor. This is to help prevent the situation from appearing again down the road. Generally, the financial counseling involves taking a look at your budget and finding ways to reduce spending. These are classes held at no charge through the lending institution.

In situations where the personal loan office can’t negotiate acceptable terms with the borrower collateral on the account will be seized. There will only be collateral associated with the loan if the loan is secured. After the collateral is seized, it will be sold to repay towards the loan. If there is still an outstanding balance, then the personal loan office may move forward with turning the account over to a collection agency or take the borrower to court. 

In the event there is no collateral on the loan because it is an unsecured personal loan, the personal loan officer will follow the same procedures above. The account will either be turned over to collections or taken to a court of law. If the borrower had a co-signer on the account, they will be contacted prior to the account being processed further. If the co-signer does not accept the responsibility for the loan then they too will be turned over to collections or taken to court. 

Defaulting on a personal loan is a serious issue. It can have grave affects on your credit, affecting your ability to obtain loans in the future. A personal loan collection officer will try to work with those who loans are in default to come up with a logical solution. If one can not be found, further action will have to be taken. To prevent this from happening to you only borrow money when you have to. Budget your personal loan payment each month and stick to it. If you can’t make a payment, contact the lender immediately. They are more likely to work with you if they are kept aware of the situation as it unfolds.
