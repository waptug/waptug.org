Custom Closet Organizers for Children

Keeping ourselves is organized, but helping our children do it can be quite a chore. To make finding items in their closet much easier for them, consider a custom closet organizer. It will help them keep their room cleaner and also help them learn about organization at a very early age. To make the project fun for them, let them assist with picking out the closet organization system as well as installing it. 

For the best results, consider a custom closet organization system that you can change down the road as your child grows. This also gives you the option of helping them reorganize their closet in the future. You will want to consider your child’s ability to reach the top of their closet. If they can’t, then organize it to where the most common things they need to reach are at their level.

Placing a clothing rod lower than what is standard in an average closet allows them more independence to hang up and choose their own clothes. It will also give you one less chore to do. They also can’t use the excuse that there is no place in their closet to put anything! Even if your child can reach the top of the closet, adding a second clothing rod is a great way to have more space to hang up clothing. 

Adjustable shelves can be place at lower levels for children to store items easily. You can them higher them up as the child gets older. You can also resort to placing items that aren’t used often on the very top shelves where you can help the child access them when needed. Colored milk crates work great for this, and they are very inexpensive.

Adding hooks work well for hats, robes, and jackets too. To save even more space in the closet, consider hooking them on the inside of the door. A shoe rack is a necessity for any child’s closet. How many times have you had to help you child locate a shoe? You can also use a hanging shoe rack. If it is too tall for the child, hang it as low as possible. You can put the shoes that are for rare occasions in the high holders for the child. You can also cut one in half and have to shorter shoe holders. These fit well on the inside of a closet door as well. 

Keeping in mind that the idea behind a custom closet organization system for your child is to make it simpler for them, not for you. Each person has their own way of organizing, so let your child decide how items will be grouped. You can give them some pointers, but your child will be more willing to keep their closet organized if they get some say in how it is going to be done. A combination of hanging space, cubbies, drawers, shelves, and shoe organizers can help you and your child tackle this feat. 

Customizing the storage space in your child’s closet can turn it from a location of chaos to a well organized place to store their clothing and other personal items. Since the needs of a child are continually changing, you should consider adjustable closet organization products that can change with your child. You can find the right products to organize a closet for any age of child, from an infant to a teenager.
