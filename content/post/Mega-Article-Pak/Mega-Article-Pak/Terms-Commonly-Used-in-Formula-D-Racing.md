Terms Commonly Used in Formula D Racing

Are you a fan of racing? If you are, there is a good chance that you may enjoy the sport known as Formula D Racing, which is also commonly referred to as Formula Drifting.  If you haven’t already had the opportunity to enjoy a Formula D Racing event, live or on television, you are advised to do so. It is likely that you will enjoy what you see.

Although you may enjoy what you see, when it comes to watching a Formula D Racing event, there is a good chance that you may also be a little bit confused.  As with just about any other sport, there are certain terms that are used in Formula Drifting.  These terms can be difficult to understand, especially for those who are unfamiliar with the sport of drifting. For that reason, if you are interested in becoming a fan of Formula Drifting, you may want to take the time to familiarize yourself with some of the most commonly used terms.  

Perhaps, the most important term that you need to be aware of is drifting.  Drifting is what is known as intentionally causing a vehicle to loose traction. This is done by using certain drifting techniques. These techniques will not only cause the car tires to loose traction, but they will also cause the car to want to lose control and slide at a specific angle.  

A donut is another term that is regularly used in Formula D Racing.  Unlike many of the other terms, there is a good chance that you already know what a donut is.  Donuts are used in a number of different sports, as well as with everyday recreational car use.  A donut involves using the rear wheels of the car to rotate around to the front.  This also involves the use of a popular car term, otherwise known as burning rubber.

Over steer is another popular term used in Formula D Racing.  Over steering is also commonly known as over rotating.  This most commonly occurs when a car is going around a corner.  It is created when drifting is used or when a car begins to loose traction. With Formula Drifting, over steering, in a way, causes the car to loose control. The goal of professional drifting is to prevent this from happening.

The opposite of over steer is under steer.  Under steering is also used in Formula Drifting.  It involves the use of the front tires, instead of the rear tires. With under steering, a car looses traction in the front. This loss of traction, when at a high speed, causes the vehicle to make an outward sliding motion.  As with over steering, under steering also makes it difficult for a car to be controlled.  

As previously mentioned in a number of different descriptions, drifting techniques are used.  There are a number of drifting techniques that are used in Formula D Racing. These techniques may include, but are in no way limited to, a Kansei Drift, a Braking Drift, an E-Brake Drift, a Dirt Drop Drift, a Long Slide Drift, and an FF Drift. When further examining each drifting technique, you will find that many have a specific purpose. For instance, some drifting techniques will cause a car to move in a certain direction.  The type of drifting technique used is often taken into consideration, when it comes to judging a professional Formula Drifting event.  

The above mentioned terms, such as over steering and under steering, are just a few of the many used in Formula Drifting. If you would like more information on the sport of drifting, you are advised to further research the sport online. Online, you should be able to find a number of different websites that explain drifting, as well as other common drifting terms, in great detail. You may also be able to familiarize yourself with the sport by reading a few drifting books. These books can easily be ordered online or they can be found at most storefront book stores.
