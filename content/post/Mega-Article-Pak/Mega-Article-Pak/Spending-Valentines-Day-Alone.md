Spending Valentine’s Day Alone

Whether you are in a committed relationship and your partner is away for the holidays or you just do not have a date on Valentine’s Day, spending this day alone can be very sad for some people. Women especially are likely to dwell on the fact that they are alone this day but some men may wish they had someone special to spend the day with as well. However, spending Valentine’s Day alone does not have to be such as sad day. This article will offer a few tips for how to have fun on Valentine’s Day even if you are alone for the day. 

Those who are in long distance relationships often find themselves alone on days such as Valentine’s Day, anniversaries or birthdays. If you are in this situation you likely realize there will be times when you are spending Valentine’s Day apart from your loved one. For example if you and your partner live miles away from each other because of work and only see each other on the weekends, you will likely be alone on Valentine’s Day if it falls during the week. However, there are other ways you can make the day seem special. For example if you know you are going to be alone on Valentine’s Day, try to keep yourself busy throughout the day. Schedule appointments such as manicures or pedicures, run errands or make plans to meet a friend for lunch or dinner. This will help to keep you from dwelling on the fact that it is Valentine’s Day. You can also make plans for the following weekend ahead of time so you will have something to look forward to. You may still be alone on Valentine’s Day but if you know you will be celebrating on the weekend it will help to make the day feel less sad and will help to make you feel less lonely.

If you are alone on Valentine’s Day because you are not in a relationship, you can still have a great time on Valentine’s Day. One way to do this is to rent a few movies and order in diner from a really nice restaurant. Try ordering from a restaurant you have always wanted to try or from a place which you know is very popular with couples on Valentine’s Day. This will help to make the day more special for you and you will be less likely to feel as though you are left out from the day’s activities. Just because you are alone does not mean you can’t enjoy a great meal and have a fabulous night by yourself.

If you have other friends who are single, you might consider hosting a singles only party on Valentine’s Day. You can invite all of your single friend and ask them each to bring someone else who is single. You and your friends will enjoy spending time together away from all of the couples who can make Valentine’s Day seem so lonely for those who are not in a relationship. You might even wind up meeting someone great at your Valentine’s Day party and next year you will not be alone on Valentine’s Day. You can even try playing match making games at the party which encourage the guests to get to know each other. Even if you do not wind up meeting someone great, one of your friends might. Examples of games you might play are the dating game or scavenger hunts which encourage guests to find other participants who have certain interests or personality traits.

Finally, if you are alone on Valentine’s Day, it is important to remember it does not mean you will always be alone. One of the biggest mistakes singles often make on Valentine’s Day is spending too much time dwelling on the holiday. It is very important to remember that being alone on Valentine’s Day is not the end of the world. Try doing something for yourself like giving yourself a manicure, going for a run or taking a long bath. This will help you to focus more on yourself and your good qualities than the fact that you do not have a date on Valentine’s Day.
