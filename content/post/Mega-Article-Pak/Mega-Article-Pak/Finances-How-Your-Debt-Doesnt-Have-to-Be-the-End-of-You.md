Finances:  How Your Debt Doesn’t Have to Be the End of You

Are you a woman who is in debt?  Whether you have debt solely from attending college, from credit cards, old medical bills, or a combination of them all, you may be scared, unsure, and frustrated.  In today’s society, with regularly rude calls from debt collectors, you may be feeling as if your debt is causing you to become insane.  Yes, it may seem like the end of the world, especially at first, but it is important to remember that your debt doesn’t have to the be the end of you.

As previously stated, a large number of debt-ridden women in the United States have problems with debt collectors calling at just about all hours, as well as having rude attitudes. The last thing that you will want to do is allow a debt collector to get you all worked up, no matter how they act or treat you.  If you feel that you cannot take it anymore, you do not have to.  At any point in time, when speaking to a debt collector, you can simply hang up the telephone.  More drastic approaches have been used by women including screening all telephone calls with the use of caller id or an answering machine.

Although you may not be interested in speaking with a debt collector, you may want to think about doing so.  Often times, you will find that debt collectors stop calling or at least reduce the number of calls that they place to you once they are able to at least speak with you. So, if you are feeling up to it, go ahead and answer that phone. Just be sure not to make any payment arrangements that you cannot keep. Also, be sure to check the statue of limitations in your state.  In some states, such as New York, the statue of limitations on when debt can be collected is six years.

Another one of the many reasons why debt is so stressful and such an issue for many women is because they feel helpless and hopeless when they are unable to pay their debt.  What you need to remember though is that there are always ways that you can go about working to pay off your debt, even if it is just a little bit at a time. It may seem silly, but paying off your debt, even if it is only twenty dollars here and there, is likely lessen the burden and stress that you currently feel.

If you would like to get out of debt, but you don’t know how, you may want to consider making an appointment with a debt reduction specialist or an accountant. While this professional assistance will cost you a little bit of money, upfront, it is well worth it for many women; women just like you.  That is because the professional assistance of debt reduction specialists and accountants may be able to help you get your life back on track.

Although the cost of seeking professional assistance is more than worth it, you may not necessarily have the money to spend. If that is the case, you can still work to get yourself out of debt and settle this stressful issue once and for all. What you are urged to do is examine your spending habits.  You may even want to record all of the purchases that you make during one weeks time. How many of those purchases can you live without, even just temporarily? As previously stated, paying off your debt, even in little increments, may be able to help reduce the stress often associated with unpaid debts.  So, even if you are only able to save two dollars on a soda each day, that should provide you with twenty dollars a week to put towards your debt.

In short, debt is an issue that many women must face and deal with each day. Although it may seem like it, debt doesn’t have to be the end of you, as outlined above.
