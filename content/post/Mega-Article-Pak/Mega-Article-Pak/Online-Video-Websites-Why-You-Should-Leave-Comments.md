Online Video Websites, Why You Should Leave Video Comments

Are an individual who loves getting your entertainment online?  If so, there is a good chance that you know what online video sites are. In fact, there is also a good chance that you have visited, at least, one before.  If you have, what did you think of the videos that you saw?  If you liked them, did you rate them or leave any comments?  If not, you should have.

As previously mentioned, online video websites are a source of entertainment for many internet users.  This is because many online video websites allow you to view their videos free of charge.  Of course, there are some video sites that will charge you to become a member or charge you a fee for watching certain videos, but most are free to use.  This is why online video websites offer the best possible source of online entertainment, because they are free to use or at least reasonably priced.

When it comes to finding a video online, you will find that it all depends on the online video website that you are visiting.  Videos that you should be able to find online may include, but should not be limited to music videos, homemade videos, celebrity interviews, sports recaps, and television shows.  Most online video sites have a large collection of homemade videos.  These videos are made by individuals, just like you.  Many individuals go through a lot of trouble to make their own video and upload it to share with you. That is why it is advised that you rate all of the videos that you see and leave comments, if they are allowed.  

Perhaps, the most important reason why you should leave comments on a video website is to make your opinions known.  Many internet users leave positive comments when they have viewed a video that they thought was well put together.  In addition to positive comments, there are also internet users who leave negative comments, as well. If you were offended or left unsatisfied by watching a video, you can leave a negative comment.  When leaving a negative comment, it is advised you be as tasteful as can be. You will not just want to say that the video stunk, but you may also want to offer helpful suggestions.  

Video makers love getting comments, especially those that focus on the positive points of their video, but that is not the only reason why you should leave a comment. There are a number of different online video websites that rank their member’s videos in a number of different ways.  Many online video websites rank videos by their user ratings, but others rank their videos by the number of comments that their videos have.  YouTube is one of those websites.  So, not only could you be making your opinions known, but you could also help to increase the ranking of the video that you just watched and enjoyed.

As you can easily see, there are a number of different reasons why you should leave a comment on a video that you watched online.  Although a fairly large number of online video websites allow you to post video comments, not all will.  In the event that comments are not allowed, you will, at least, want to rate the video. Almost all video websites will allow you to do this.
