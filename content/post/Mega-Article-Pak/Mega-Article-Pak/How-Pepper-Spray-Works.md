How Pepper Spray Works

Also referred to as an OC or capsicum spray, pepper spray is a very effective inflammatory agent that can easily irritate the eyes and result in pain, temporary blindness, and tears.  Pepper spray is an organic based agent that comes from cayenne peppers.  The spray will normally come in canister form, which his often times small enough to be carried in your pocket or in a woman’s purse.

Once the spray is used it will immediately result in dilating of the capillaries in the eyes, resulting in temporary blindness, chocking, coughing, and tearing of the eyes.  The spray will also cause an extremely intense burning on the skin and result in nausea.  The mucous membranes will also begin to swell, making breathing very difficult.  The spray is very painful, often resulting in the individual who was sprayed to double over and fall to the ground.  It causes temporary incapacitation, due to the fact that the individual won’t be able to breathe or see properly.

Although the spray is very effective with most, it may not have as much of an effect on individuals who are on drugs, drunk, or already hysterical.  With these types of people, you may need to give them a couple of quick sprays to the face to get the right effect.  The overall effect on the length of the spray will all depend on the strength of the pepper spray.  Most pepper spray effects will last anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour.

Often times the spray is used with controlling riots or in self defense situations.  Pepper spray is very handy to have in violent assault situations, as a violent assault occurs every few seconds in the United States alone.  Pepper spray is safer to use than guns or knives.  It is also non lethal, although there have been rare cases where pepper spray has lead to death.  In these cases however, there were medical conditions present that the spray aggravated – leading to death.

Pepper spray is great to have around your home, or to carry with you at all times.  If a burglar breaks into your home while you are there, you obviously want something to protect yourself with.  A can of pepper spray is very effective, and can easily stop someone from attacking you.  All it takes is a direct spray to the eyes.

Although it is very effective to have with you, pepper spray is illegal to have in some countries, such as the United Kingdom.  In the United States however, there are some areas that require you to have a license before you can legally carry pepper spray.  Before you buy some pepper spray, you should always make sure that you can legally carry it in the area you live in.
