Musicians And CD Duplication

These days, technology is always available for any
inspiring musician to record, create, and even
duplicate CDs.  The duplication of CDs will involve
CD-R media.  CD-R media prices have dropped a lot
over the last several years, making them affordable
for anyone who wants to use them.

If your band is ready to start selling CDs, your 
best option may be to have your CDs replicated.  
Replicated CDs are the same CDs that you'll find
in music stores by major label artists.  They all
have excellent artwork printed on the CD inserts,
nice tray card inserts, screened art on the CD, 
and they are even shrink wrapped.

The retail CDs that you buy aren't duplicated, they
are replicated.  This means that an exact replica
of your master CD has been stamped out on all of
the other CDs.  If you are serious about selling
your music for profit, replication is the way to
go.

The fact is, most stores simply won't sell duplicated
CDs.  Duplicated CDs can be against the law, 
which is the main reason retail stores simply 
won't carry them.  Replicated CDs let the stores
know that the CD is legit, and they will almost
always carry those CDs.

For musicians and inspiring bands, CD duplication
can tend to be a bit more expensive than that
of replication.  To duplicate CDs, you need a 
computer with a CD burner, your CD-R media, cases,
and a lot of man hours.

With CD replication, you can get many more copies,
professional artwork, a barcode for inventory, and
cases included.  Replication is obviously to 
expensive for those looking to simply back up 
pictures and data on a personal computer, although
the prices are just right for musicians looking
to make profit off of their CDs.
