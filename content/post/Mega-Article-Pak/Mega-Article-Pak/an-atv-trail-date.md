An ATV Trail Date

The ATV trail is a place for dirt, mud, gravel and romance?

Today’s ladies are hardly the proper models of the Victorian Era; in fact, there are plenty of gals out there just itching to ride their four-wheelers with as much gusto as their male counterparts.  So if you’re a dude who’s scratching his head for the perfect place to woo your next girlfriend, why not choose an ATV trail excursion?

Of course, in order to ensure that your adventure is on the amorous side, you’ll need to incorporate a little bit of heartfelt and sincere sweetness into the occasion.  Start off by sending your “special friend” an invite for an ATV cruise to watch the sunset from a trail nearby.  The invitation should be handwritten and sent via the mail, or, if you’re cyber-savvy, emailed.

Plan your date as you would any other.  First, map out the perfect ATV trail based on your companion’s four-wheeling level.  If she’s just starting out (or hasn’t ridden before), choose a smooth path that will leave her breathless and smiling, but definitely not terrified.  On the other hand, if she’s a veteran ATV operator, you can up the ante by picking out a more technically difficult trail filled with twists and turns.  Regardless, make certain you know the mileage so you’re at the appropriate spot come nightfall (a sunset always makes a lovely date backdrop.)

Because this is a date, you’ll want to look your best.  Though ATV riding can be a dirty proposition, a suit and tie is wildly inappropriate; however, that doesn’t mean you have to show up looking like a slob.  At least comb your hair and trim your fingernails. Remember to brush your teeth, too, as most people like fresh breath.

When you pick up or meet your sweet thing, show her how much you care by holding up a bag packed with plenty of goodies for the two of you to enjoy during your adventure.  These could include some non-alcoholic beverages, yummy snacks, a radio or CD player for music options and a camera so you can capture your moments together.  

During the ride, you’ll no doubt have a plethora of opportunities to wow your significant other by pointing out exceptional scenery or by picking her a handful of wildflowers.  Since this is a date, don’t be in a hurry to get from point A to point B; allow yourselves to linger when feasible.  And, of course, if the mood strikes, “stealing” kisses is always appropriate if mutually desired.

Should something go wrong along the way, keep yourself calm, cool and collected.  Remember, this ATV trail date is about the journey, not about the destination and she’ll recall fondly how you handled an unexpected situation if you keep a level head.

Though an ATV trail date of this sort isn’t guaranteed to produce a relationship that will last the test of time, it’s still likely to be a terrific experience for you both.  You just have to put a little planning into the excursion and be open to possibilities.
