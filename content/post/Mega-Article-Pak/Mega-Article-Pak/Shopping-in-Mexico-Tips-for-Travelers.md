Shopping in Mexico: Tips for Travelers  

Mexico is a wonderful place to visit and is known for its wonderful resorts, beaches, and rich history.  It is also known for great bargains and exquisite boutiques.  When visiting Mexico, many tourists are excited to browse through the various shopping centers.  

When shopping in Mexico, it is important to understand that there are strict rules that are enforced regarding the purchases that can be made in Mexico, as well as what can be brought back in to the United States.  Before you leave, it may be wise to review the United States Customs and Border Protection rules. These rules will let you know what you can purchase in Mexico and bring home with you. 

Endangered species are not allowed to be purchased and brought back into the United States.  Since Mexico has such a wide range of wildlife, there are many products that are available for sale there. Many of these products are considered illegal and will be taken by United States Customs and Border Patrol.  You may be given a fine if you purchase these items and try to bring them over the border; however, additional action may be taken.  When it doubt you are encouraged to stay away from wild animals that are for sale. In addition to the animals themselves, you should be wary of goods that may have been made by these animals.    

Crocodiles are on the endangered species list.  Though it may seem enticing to have a new pair of Crocodile boots or a purse, you should avoid these items at all costs.  You will find that the government takes these violations seriously.  They will make routine checks at inspection points looking for any items that are deemed endangered.  Stuffed wildlife is also forbidden, so if you see any of these and they look appealing, resist the urge to purchase them and leave them be.  

Mexican birds are colorful and exotic.  For those who deal with live trade, it may seem that purchasing exotic parrots from Mexico is a wonderful idea, but you need to think again.  Purchasing birds from Mexico is also considered violation.  To remain on the safe side, you should avoid purchasing any wildlife or wildlife products.  Even stuffed birds are against the law.  Even you may see these in abundance at shops and street markets, do your homework, and pass them up.  There are many other wonderful souvenirs that you can purchase that are legal and will pass through the border.

Antiquities and glazed ceramics are beautiful and appealing to many tourists.  Yet, Mexico considers their antiques to be property of the government.  This means that if you uncover any artifacts and try to bring them back to the United States, you will be prosecuted for theft and maybe even face additional charges.  It is best to leave any authentic looking artifacts in Mexico where they belong.

Glazed ceramics look beautiful and may be a wonderful addition to your home décor.  However, many of the ceramics made and found in Mexico are made with lead.  It is for this reason that you should avoid purchasing glazed ceramics from Mexico.  If you do make the purchase, you need to make sure that everyone in your household is aware of the potential dangers.

While it may seem as if you are prohibited from purchasing many items sold in Mexican shops, there are additional items that you can purchase.
