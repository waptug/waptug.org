Hiking Clubs:  Should You Join One?

Have you ever heard of a hiking club before?  While hiking clubs do have different meanings, a hiking club is often used to describe a group of individuals who regularly enjoy hiking, often together in groups.  If you are an avid hiker or if you just enjoy going hiking, you may want to think about joining a hiking club.

As it was previously mentioned, hiking clubs are often used to describe groups of individuals who have a love for hiking.  The majority of the time, you will find that hiking club members hike together. This is ideal for a number of different reasons. For one, hiking with someone that loves hiking just as much as you do can be fun and exciting.  It is also important to mention safety.  When you hike with multiple individuals, especially experienced hikers, you are less likely to have an accident or find yourself in a dangerous situation.

In addition to going on traditional hikes with each other, there are many hiking club members who travel to hiking trails or hiking parks that are not considered local.  Many times, these types of trips require camping or staying at a hotel.  One of the many reasons why these types of long distance hiking trips are done by hiking clubs is because the group members can split the cost of doing so. What does this mean for you?  It means that if you would like to take long distance hiking adventures, but you don’t have any friends or family members who would like to go with you, you may want to think about joining a hiking club.

When examining all of the benefits of joining a hiking club, it is important to remember that not all hiking clubs are the same. There are some hiking clubs where members only meet up for hiking adventures, but then there are hiking clubs that do much more.  For instance, there are hiking clubs that have monthly or even weekly meetings. These meetings are often used to plan hiking trips, discuss the latest in hiking gear trends, and so forth. There are also hiking clubs that use fundraisers, like car washes or chicken barbeques, to pay for their hiking adventures. In all honesty, you will find that the benefits you are presented with will all depend on the hiking club that you choose to join.

Speaking of choosing a hiking club, when it comes to choosing a hiking club, there are a number of important factors that you should take into consideration. For example, you will find that many hiking clubs charge their members small monthly or yearly fees. You will want to find a hiking club that is easy to afford. You may also want to take your schedule into consideration as well.  Do you have time to attend all monthly or even the weekly meetings?  If your hiking club has scheduled meetings, you will want to attend them, not just attend the scheduled hiking adventures. This will help you grow comfortable with those that you will hike with and visa versa.

If you would like to join a hiking club, you may want to first try and see if there are any local hiking clubs in your area.  Depending on where you live or if there is a hiking trail or a hiking park nearby, there is a good chance that you may have a local hiking club or even a number of them to choose from. You can usually find information on local hiking clubs by using the internet or by asking those that you know for recommendations.  If you are still coming up empty handed, you may want to think about asking the staff at a local hiking park if they know of any local hiking clubs.  

As you can see, hiking clubs are fun ways to share your love for hiking with others who feel the same way about it as you do.  Although there is a good chance that you will be able to find a hiking club to join, you can also always start your own, if you wish to do so.
