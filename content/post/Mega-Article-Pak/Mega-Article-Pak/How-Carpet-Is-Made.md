How Carpet Is Made

The carpet that is made today is a mix of old world
craftsmanship and a touch of 21st century innovation.
By combining the two, carpet is able to become the
household feature that we all know and love - and
get tired of cleaning.

Carpet can be manufactured in one of two ways; 
weaving or tufting.  Carpets that are woven are
primarily wool and are very durable, and very 
expensive as well.  The woven carpet types can be
hand produced, as it has been for centuries, or by
machine.  No matter what method is chosen, the same
procedures are followed.

The yarn for the carpet is woven through or around
vertical fibers known as warps, and then locked 
into place with horizontal strands known as wefts.
The woven carpets can utilize a variety of colors
as well to create intricate patterns in the 
highest quality of carpets.

Tufting machines can also be utilized as well, as
they use computers to determine the patterns, styles,
construction, and density.  No longer does someone
have to do everything by hand or mentally, as the
tufting machines will take all of the guesswork out
and make things easy on the operator.

Once the fibers have been locked into place, the
carpet is dyed using a variety of methods that 
will create patterns or effects.  For cut pile
carpets, the final stage is stretched, 
cutting the pile loops.  This is an important
stage, as it will determine the softness and
feel of the carpet.

The carpet will also receive a secondary stretch
backing as well to give it stability and allow
it to be stretched during the installation 
process.  Most of the carpets of this day and 
age will receive stain protection as well, which
happens during the manufacturing phase.

The way that a carpet is made will greatly affect
how the carpet is installed.  In the past, the
creation of carpet was a very complicated 
process, as there were no computers or technology
to do most of the work.  Back then, it was all
done by hand.  The carpets were great, although
there wasn't any colors or textures that we
have to choose from today.

The carpet manufacturers of today have a lot of
technology at their disposal, which makes life
at the plants easy.  Operators can watch and
operate machines to do a lot of the work, which
makes their job a lot easier.  

The continuous fibers found with carpet are heat
set and twisted at the mill to give a tightly
twisted product that is commonly found with 
frieze carpets.  This type of yarn is less
bulky although it will hold its shape for a long
period of time, which is great for those who
don't like to replace their carpet every couple
of years.
