Reviews about iPod video

	
The new iPod video has stirred a lot of reactions, a lot of reviews, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of its utility, quality and features. These reviews are important especially because of the fact that the new iPod video was launched without a serious study of the market, of the customer’s tastes and wishes. From this point of view this is a daring initiative and a great step in the video development.
	
The reviews usually point out the amazement and the great success concerning the new iPod video, but also highlight some aspects that may contribute to its improvement. For example, the great advantage of connecting the iPod video to the TV set and playing the videos on it is well-received. But on the other hand, the fact that the iPod video cannot be connected to the computer is seen as a disadvantage. The transfer from iPod to computer is not possible and this fact may be a suggestion for the designers and creators of the iPod video. 
      
Some customers are in love with this device because of the possibility of watching the favorite TV shows and ABC hits like “Lost” and “Desperate Housewives” even in the road. The stress of loosing the relaxing TV show or film may be very unpleasant especially in the case of difficult days at work. Therefore, the possibility of watching them on an iPod video is an excellent idea. Besides, the iPod video matches the crazy contemporary lifestyle, giving the opportunity of checking the e-mail, of finding out the time in other cities very useful especially in the case of people that travel a lot. 
      
Satisfaction and pleasant remarks are the main notes for the new iPod video, as it is really a great product. The fact that it has more features, more quality, longer battery life and smaller dimensions, thinner display is enjoyed a lot. A small disadvantage, compared to the great new benefits, is the fact that the images, photos from the iPod video transferred to the TV set are too bright, although very clear and nice. 
      
Another great advantage is the fact that the customers may listen to the music over 14 hours (it depends on the model). But the reviews point out a disadvantage – the fact that the video playback time is only 2 hours. Another disadvantage is the fact that the iTunes from the iTunes Music Store are too expensive, but taking into account the great quality of the sound this may not be such a great disadvantage. Besides, the equalizer may be set for a better quality sound.
      
Some other reviews highlight the fact that the screen quality is clear and maybe clearer than of the most TV sets. This aspect may be put together with the fact that the screen is better and bigger although the display is smaller and thinner. 
      
A special attention may be paid to the fact that, as in other cases, some defect items may be in sale, but it may be exchanged within 14 days. Another disadvantage that completes the fact that the iPod video cannot be connected to the computer is that it doesn’t work well with wireless FM transmitters. This problem may be also managed with a cassette adapter for the iPod so that it would work great. 
      
Unresponsiveness and freezing video images are other problems mentioned in the user reviews. Hardware problems and the low quality of some songs may be other possible problems according to the reviews of the customers. These aspects seem to point out the fact that this technology is not mature enough and the new iPod video is from some point of view an experiment and a way of testing the market. 
      
Anyway, the fact that the new iPod video has reduced dimensions and may fit any pocket. Besides, the high resolution and the great quality of the songs are exclusive advantages and are mentioned by the customers with joy and satisfaction.
