All About Data Recovery

At some point in time, everyone who owns a computer will experience the trials and tribulations of hard drive failure.  The reasons behind it vary, and could include everything from a human error to damages resulting from flood or water.  Viruses can play a role as well, along with many other factors.  For many years, the need to recover data that has been lost or destroyed has made data recovery such a very valuable asset.

Almost all hard drives can be recovered.  Normally, if the drive is making a ticking or a scratching noise, you can use certain software programs to recover the data.  Sometimes, due to age or bad parts, the aperture arm in the hard drive can fail, or the platters can become damaged and lose the data that they hold.  If you can’t recover the information with software, you’ll need to send the hard drive off and have it either rebuilt or have technicians recover your data.

Data recovery is always an option, from hard drives that are 2 GB in size to the largest of over 300    GB or more of data.  No matter what size hard drive you have, the data can generally be recovered.  Keep in mind that if you’ve had a computer crash, you’ll need to send the hard drive off to have the data recovered by technicians.

One of the key benefits of data recovery is the fact that information can also be retrieved from the recycle bin as well.  Partition recovery, and even information that has been lost somewhere on the disk can be retrieved as well.  Even though it may seem like your data is gone forever - the technicians that specialize in data recovery can retrieve it.

From Windows to Mac, everything can be recovered.  There are different filing structures and formats, including NTFS and FAT32.  These are common Windows filing structures, and hold all of the information for your hard. 

Those of you who have multiple hard drives in your computer, can rest assured that RAID configurations can also be recovered.  If a single hard drive on the RAID configuration fails, the RAID setup will absorb the blow and there won’t be a loss of data.  On the other hand, if the entire RAID configuration crashes, it will crash big time.  Whenever this happens, you’ll need to send it off and have technicians restore both the RAID hardware and software.

Anytime your hard drive happens to crash or malfunction, data recovery is there to help you get back your files.  Whether they are personally files or very important files that are need for business - you can put your trust in data recovery and know that you’ll get everything the back the way it was.
