Ball Chair

If you are tired of the average office chair and
find yourself experiencing chronic back pain, an
exercise ball chair may be the chair you've been
looking for.  The standard office chair can be 
very cramped and hard on the back; which is where
ball chairs can really help you out.

Ball chairs are the new and alternative solutions
to traditional office chairs.  A ball chair is 
exciting, different, and also provides your back
with plenty of support while you sit, almost making
you free from any of your back problems.  Using an
exercise ball as a ball chair is an excellent way 
to maintain the correct posture when sitting.  

When choosing the right ball chair for your needs, 
here are some tips to help you:
	- The size of the chair should keep your
feet on the floor while you sit, with your arms 
resting comfortably on the desk.  When you sit on 
the ball chair, you should keep your legs forming
a 90 degree angle at the knees.  Any more or any 
less will mean that the ball chair isn't right for
you.
	- Your weight is a very important factor 
when choosing a ball chair.  If your weight compresses
the chair and flattens it, you need to get a bigger
ball chair.  If you happen to be very light in 
weight, you can under-inflate the ball chair.

Ball chairs will keep your back and abdominal muscles
active because of the slight bouncing it provides.  
Therefore, you can maintain proper posture, which 
helps to prevent back problems.  Even though a ball
chair can be a great alternative to a standard office
chair, you should consult a doctor before you purchase
one.  If you've had any back problems or surgeries, you 
want to get a doctor's advice before you make that
final purchase.
