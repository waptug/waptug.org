Carpet Cleaning Machines

With the creation of the carpet, the invention of the
carpet cleaning machine wasn't far away.  The very
first hand held carpet cleaner was designed and
tested in Chicago in 1860, while the first power
operated vacuum cleaner was invented in the 1900s 
by Cecil Booth.

Around the same time Cecil Booth finished his
invention, a man by the name of James Spangler came
up with his own invention - a vacuum cleaner that
he later sold to his cousin Hoover.  As everyone
knows, Hoover has since became one of the most
dominant names in the world of vacuum cleaners and
is certainly one of the most popular household
names in the world.

For many housewives, the vacuum cleaner was deemed
a blessing, as it helped to keep the house clean
in a fraction of the time.  From the beginning,
vacuum cleaners were only able to suck up dust and
dirt, although with modern technology these days,
inventors are able to design wet cleanes that can
steam carpets and kill germs at the same time.

Carpet is capable of covering the floor of a 
house, flat, or bungalow and keeping people's feet
warm in the winter.  Years ago, people needed to
sweep their floors or carpets, but with the
invention of the vacuum cleaner, people could 
easily detract the dust and dirt from their
carpets with less effort.  It was also determined
that businesses, corporations, and apartments
would need someone to clean their carpets as
well, so the invention of the commercial carpet
cleaner wasn't far away.

Vacuum cleaners operate by using a pump system.
The pumping system will suck up the air from a 
hose, which will in turn suck up the dirt and
dust from anything that stands in front of the
house opening.  On the inside, the vacuum cleaner
is a filtering system that will collect the dust
and dirt that can later be placed outside in the
garbage.

Right now, there are seven main types of vacuum
cleaners - the upright, canister, back pack style,
built in, robotic, hand held, and the wet/dry
vacuum cleaners.  These different types of vacuum
cleaners are available in a variety of different
styles, sizes, and offer various voltage and
power sizes as well.

One of the most significant developments in 
vacuums has been the invention of the very popular
cyclone carpet cleaner.  Unlike the previous
vacuum cleaners, the cyclone collects dirt and
dust in a large cylinder.  The cyclone operates
using a central air force and number of filters.
The filter will filter the dust and dirt into
stages, so that the air being sucked up into the
cylinder can be cleaned then released back into
the air through a central outlet.
