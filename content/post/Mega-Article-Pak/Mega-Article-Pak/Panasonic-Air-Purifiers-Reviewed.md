When you think of Panasonic, what comes to mind?  If you are like many other individuals, you would think of batteries, televisions, radios, or DVD players.  Panasonic is a popular company that is often viewed as a media or an electronic company. While Panasonic does place a lot of focus on entertainment, it is not their only focus. In addition to some of the previously mentioned products, you will also find that Panasonic makes and sells a number of different air purifiers.

Panasonic air purifier comes in a number of different models. These models currently include the Panasonic HEPA Air Purifier, the Panasonic F-P10HU1 Air Purifier and the Panasonic F-P10HU2 Air Purifier.  The cost of these air purifiers, as well as their replacement filters, will all depend on which model you purchase. On average, Panasonic air purifiers can be purchased for around $200 to $300.  The cost of replacement features, as mentioned above, will vary.

Despite the fact that Panasonic has a number of different air purifiers available for sale, you will find that most of their air purifiers have the same features; features that you can likely benefit from. One of those features is HEPA filters. As you saw above, one of the Panasonic air purifiers specifically mentioned HEPA in its name.  Even though the other Panasonic air purifiers are not outright labeled as being HEPA products, they are.  All Panasonic air purifiers should come equipped with the popular and well performing HEPA filters.
 
Panasonic air purifiers come equipped with the latest technology. In addition to HEPA filters, you will find that many Panasonic air purifiers have modernized controls and sensors. One of those sensors is a micro dirt sensor.  A micro dirt sensor allows the air purifier and its fans to adjust to the indoor air.  Essentially this means, that the air purifier may reduce its strength or increase it, depending on the air quality in the room it is being used.  This also works in conjunction with a twenty-four hour air control monitor, which most Panasonic air purifiers come equipped with.  You will also find that most air purifiers also have control timers.

If you are a cigarette smoker, or if someone inside your house is, you will also be able to benefit from a Panasonic air purifier. This is because most Panasonic air purifiers not only work to clean up the air, but they also work to clean up the smell of the room which they are in. This is done with a special deodorizing filter. The deodorizing filter will remove a number of smells, which includes the smells associated with cigarette smoke.

As mentioned above, you will need to purchase replacement filters for your Panasonic air purifier, should you choose to buy one. What is nice about most Panasonic air purifiers is that they only need to have their filters changed every couple of years. In fact, according to Panasonic, in normal conditions, each air purifier filter should last around three years.  This is amazing, especially when compared to most of the other air purifier replacement filters. It is not uncommon for other air purifiers to need replacement filters every couple of months or once a year.  Essentially, this means that you may be saving yourself a decent amount of money, in the long run.

If you are interested in purchasing a Panasonic air purifier, you will find that you have a number of different options. You can buy an air purifier directly from Panasonic; you should be able to do this online or over the phone. In addition to buying directly from Panasonic, you should also be able to shop online at a number of different online retail stores. If online shopping is not your style, you should also able to find Panasonic air purifiers at a number of storefront retail locations. These locations may include traditional department stores, electronic stores, as well as home improvement stores.
