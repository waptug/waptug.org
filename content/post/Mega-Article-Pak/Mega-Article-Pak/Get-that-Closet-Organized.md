Get that Closet Organized

Most of us have a fairly large closet, but lots of worthless space in its original design. It is no wonder things end up piled up and lost in there. To get organized you are going to need to transform that space into areas you can work with. Once you have decided on the items that will go back into your closet you are going to have to decide how you want it in there. Do you want to hang it? Put it on the floor? Have a few shelves? Or store some items on the floor? This information will help you take the proper steps to get your closet organized.

Multi tier hanging clothes rods are very useful. You can install half rods in various locations as well. This is an excellent choice if you need a full length rod area for dresses and want a shorter hanging space for shirts. Most of us have a standard closet with one hanging clothes rod all the way across. Even simply adding a second one down below will double your storage space! 

Use bins, dividers, small shelves, or baskets to separate and organize your smaller closet items. You can even put your sweaters in a basket or on a shelf since hangers can cause them to lose their shape. Cubbies are great for shoes, belts, scarfs, and other similar items. Carousals are wonderful for hats, ties, and purses. If you are creative you may want to use a particular closet organization product for an entirely different purpose. Do it! This is your project so make it work for you. 

This is your chance to customize your closet storage space. Make it accessible and convenient for what you need. Some of us have tons of clothes and only a few pairs of shoes. Some of us have a pair of shoes to go with each outfit. Therefore no custom closet organization design is perfect for everyone. For the best results, take a complete inventory of the items you plan on to return to your closet and devise a plan that will give the right amount of space for the items you need it for. 

Do you plan to live in your current residence for a long time? If so, a permanent closet organization system is something you will be interested in. For those of you who move often or who rent, consider using removable closet organization products that install and remove easily. Otherwise you will find yourself in the same predicament each time you have to move. You will also want to consider the cost of each type of closet organization system before making any decisions. 

Many people don’t realize the amount of space they have on the inside of their closet doors. You can hang a bag for hats, purses, belts, umbrellas, gloves, etc. here. It is also a perfect location for hanging a shoe organizer. Make sure you take this area into consideration while devising your custom closet organization layout. 

Don’t spend money on items to design your closet until you are absolutely sure that they are going to fit well in your closet area. Most closet organizing products can’t be returned or exchanged if you have already started putting them together unless they are defective. It is a good ideal to take your measurements twice in the closet as well as when you are looking for products to purchase.
