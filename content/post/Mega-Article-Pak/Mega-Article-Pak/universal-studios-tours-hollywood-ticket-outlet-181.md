Universal Studios Tours Hollywood Ticket Outlet

While visiting Universal Studios Tours, you should 
pay a visit to the Hollywood Ticket Outlet booth. You 
can do more than purchase tickets to great shows; 
you can also request free tickets for many of the 
shows that are currently being filmed. Note that the 
shows are limited to the ones that allow studio 
audiences.

There are other services available at the Hollywood 
Ticket Outlet booth as well. These include upgraded 
park tickets, visitor information, and foreign currency 
exchange. The Hollywood Ticket Outlet is located by 
the Blues Brothers stage inside the park, and it is 
open during the same days and hours that the park 
is open.

Depending on when you visit Universal Studios, and 
what is going on at that time, you may be pleasantly
surprised to find some really great deals – or to find 
yourself sitting in the audience of your favorite 
television show! Talk about sneak previews! Even if 
you don’t plan to purchase any tickets, make sure 
that you stop by the Universal Studios Tours 
Hollywood Outlet booth to see what is being offered 
that day.
