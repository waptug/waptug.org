Mobility Scooters Ready To Go And Available In The UK

Mobility scooters, as a form of short distance transportation and assistance to those who have difficulty walking, have grown in popularity in recent years. This is in large part due to the reduction in prices by many major manufacturers and distributors of mobility scooters in the UK and worldwide. The increased interest is also the result of the mobility scooter itself being a more flexible and viable alternative option to a motorized wheel chair, manual chair or walker. 

Even with its less cumbersome appearance and shape, a mobility scooter does accommodate the needs of many people who may previously had thought a wheelchair was their only option. A mobility scooter is much less expensive than a motorized wheelchair and has a more visually appealing design. However, the rider must have adequate upper body strength and dexterity to operate and manage the movement of the scooter. The movement of a mobility scooter is managed with hand operated controls which are located on the steering column and the steering wheel. If the rider is able to walk a few steps and has sufficient upper body physical abilities, a mobility scooter might just be a welcome solution to overcoming some physical limitations. 

A few of the well respected manufacturers of mobility scooters that have distribution centers in the U.K. as well as other areas include Shoprider, Pride and Electric Mobility. All three of these manufacturers offer 3 and 4 wheel models with various features to accommodate different needs including lightweight, midrange and large models. The larger models can go up to 8mph, as opposed to the midrange models which top out at 4 mph. 

Some of the accessories that are available for use with a mobility scooter include baskets designed to attach to either the front or the rear of the scooter, crutch holders and crutch holder and walking stick bags and canopies. A canopy is especially useful outdoors and provides shade from the hot sun as well as shelter from rain and wind. Another accessory to consider would be a ramp. Ramps allow for a smooth transition from one surface area to another of a different height easy and are available in many sizes. There are even ramps that fold up to coyly imitate the appearance of a briefcase complete with user friendly fasteners and carry handle.

Mobility scooters range in price from £700 to over £3000. The higher priced models typically include two onboard batteries to provide power to a more powerful motor and are built to accommodate more weight. They may also include convenient accessory features such as baskets, crutch or walking stick holders and cup holders. 

London Mobility is a family owned business in the U.K. that distributes a variety of mobility scooters. They are committed to providing those who are less physically able the opportunity to own a high quality mobility scooter at an affordable price. London Mobility also offers reliable pre and post sale customer service and maintenance, as well as free delivery to anywhere within the U.K. mainland.
