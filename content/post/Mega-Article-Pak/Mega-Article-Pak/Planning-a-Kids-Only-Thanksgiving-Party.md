Planning a Kids’ Only Thanksgiving Party

Have you decided that you would like to host a Thanksgiving party this year?  If so, what type of Thanksgiving party do you plan on having?  If you are a parent, there is a good chance that your Thanksgiving party may be designed for children and children alone. These types of Thanksgiving parties are often referred to as kids’ only Thanksgiving parties. 

Although you might assume that it is relatively easy to host a kids’ only Thanksgiving party, you may soon realize that it isn’t as easy as you may think. The reason for that, most of the time, is that kids are often more difficult to please, when compared to adults. For that reason, there is a fairly large amount of planning and preparation that may need to go into your next Thanksgiving party.

Perhaps, the first thing that you should do, when planning a kids’ only Thanksgiving party, is invite the guests. Depending on the age of your own child or children, this may be a little bit difficult.  Some young children and teenagers may be able to invite their own party guests, but others may be unable to. Whether your child is a toddler or a little bit older, if may be a good idea if you create a Thanksgiving party guest list all on your own.  When doing so, it is advised that you invite children that are around the same age as your own. It may be a good idea to invite other children that are in your child’s class, attend the same daycare, live in the same neighborhood, or are related to your child.

Once you have taken care of the party invites, you may want to change your focus a little bit.  You will want to start focusing on the actual party.  One of the many things that you may want to plan out is the food, snacks, and drinks that you will have available.  In most cases, you will find that you do not need to go all out and cook a Thanksgiving dinner for a kids’ only party; snacks would be more than enough.  However, as a parent, you likely already know that kids can be picky when it comes to their food. That is why you are advised to have a wide array of snacks and drinks on hand.  You will not only want to make sure that, at least, some of your foods are healthy, but also that they are kid friendly.

Whether it is a Thanksgiving party, a Christmas party, or a birthday party, kids’ parties are nothing without games. That is why you will want to pick out party games for everyone to play.  Since you will be hosting a Thanksgiving party for kids, you may want to choose holiday games to play; however, it is not necessary. You can easily find a number of holiday party game ideas online, with a standard internet search. In addition to the internet, you should also be able to purchase a number of fun, kid friendly party games online or from your local department store.  While it is fun to have your party games all planned out and ready to go, be sure to leave room for suggestions. Depending on the age of your party guests, there is a good chance that they may want to play other games or offer their own suggestions.

When planning a kids’ only Thanksgiving party, it is important to remember one thing; kids may not be your only guests. As a parent, you likely know how some parents, maybe even you, just don’t want to part with their children, even for a few hours.  That is why there is a good chance that some of your party guests’ parents may wish to stay.  If this is the case, you should let them.  In addition to receiving assistance with your kids’ only Thanksgiving party, there is a good chance that you may enjoy the extra company. If other parents will be staying with their kids, it is advised that you also have a few adult snacks on hand.
