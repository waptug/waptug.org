Mountain Biking Vacation

Taking a mountain biking vacation is an excellent 
way to unwind and explore America.  There are several
companies that offer mountain biking tours that go
through scenic routes, and they often arrange any
accomodations for travelers as well.  For athletic
couples, these types of vacations offer the perfect
way to relax and enjoy some exercise together.

Each and every region in the United States has some
truly awesome mountain biking trails.  It's not just 
the major mountain ranges that offer these trails, as
any hilly, scenic, rough trail can provide riders with
the adventure they seek.  Some of the best areas to 
mountain bike ride in the United States are the Pacific
Northwest, Southwest, and Southeast states such as 
North Carolina.

Even though the entire American West area is great for a 
mountain biking vacation, the Southwest area is rapidly
becoming a popular area for the sport as well.  In the
Southwest, some of the best trails include Pinery
Canyon Road in Arizona, South Boundary Trail in New
Mexico, and Flume Trail in Nevada.

Each and every trail deserves it's reputation as a 
tough ride.  Each one of these trails is over 20 miles
in length, with Pinery Canyon being the longest, at 
over 50 miles!  Keep in mind though, just because you 
go to a trail it doesn't mean you have to ride the entire
length.

The Pacific Northwest is also a great place for a 
mountain biking vacation.  The three best trails in 
the entire region are Surveyor's Ridge in Oregon, Mount
Tamalpais in California, and the Methow Trial System in
Washington.

A mountain biking vacation is perfect for athletic people
who have the desire to explore regions at their own 
pace.  These trips are much less expensive than other
trips, yet they can easily be the adventure of a 
lifetime.
