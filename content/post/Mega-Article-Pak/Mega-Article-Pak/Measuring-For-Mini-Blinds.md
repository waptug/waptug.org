Measuring For Mini Blinds

The first thing to do when measuring for your mini
blinds is to determine if you need inside mount or
outside mount.  Inside mount will fit the blinds
within the window frame, while outside mount will 
fit the overlap of the window opening.

Inside mount
To find the width, measure the exact distance between
the inside surfaces of the window frame at the top,
middle, and also the bottom then use the narrowest
width you receive with your measurements.

To find the length, measure the exact distance
from the inside surface at the top of the window
to the bottom sill at the left, middle, and the
right then use the longest length.  If you prefer
for the blinds not to touch the windowsill, you
should deduct 1/4".  If there isn't a sill, then
you should measure the length to the point where
the blinds are to reach.

Outside mount 
To find the width, measure the exact distance 
between the outermost points where the blinds are
to be placed.  For the best of light control, the
measurement should extend 3/4" beyond the window
opening on each side.

To find the length, measure the exact distance 
from where the top of the blinds are to be placed
to the top of the windowsill.  If there isn't a
sill on your window, then measure the length to
the point where the blinds are to reach.

Measuring for your blinds is very important, as
you'll need the measurements to order the blinds.
Most companies will deduct for the brackets at
the factory, then all you'll need to do once
you receive your blinds is to install them - 
which is easy to do as well.
