Formula D Racing On G4

Are you a Formula D Racing fan?  If you aren’t already, are you thinking about becoming one?  Whether you are already a fan of this popular sport or you are looking to become a new one, there is a good chance that you would like to watch Formula D Racing events, as well as others programs focused on this popular sport. If that is the case, you are in luck.  Formula D Racing, also commonly referred to as Formula Drifting, has partnered with G4.

G4, also commonly known as G4TV, is a popular television network. This network is mostly focused on gaming; however, it does have additional programming.  Despite the additional programming, Formula D Racing can, in a way, be connected to gaming. Formula Drifting is sponsored by the popular drifting game Need for Speed. This Need for Speed game was what helped to skyrocket a relatively unknown sport, Formula D Racing, into popularity.  

The first step in watching Formula Drifting coverage, on G4TV, is to determine whether or not you have access to the channel.  According to their online website, G4 is available to customers with Direct TV, Dish Network, Time Warner Cable, Charter Communications, MediaCom, Cablevision, Bresnan Communications, RCN, Cox Communications, Comcast, Insight Communications, as well as Adelphia. Even if you have television access through one of these providers, you need to make sure that G4 is included in your programming package. In the event that it is not, you should easily be able to upgrade your package, so that it will include G4TV.

The programming found on G4TV tends to focus on Formula D events. For instance, one of those events takes place in Seattle, Washington. G4TV has an episode that is titled “Seattle Drift.”  In addition to coverage of the Seattle events, you can also find episodes that focus on past racing events.  Many of these episodes are re-aired for a specific period of time. In addition to coverage of events, you may also be treated to behind the scenes information. This information often includes driver interviews, as well as information on the cars being used in the events.

Although it would be nice to watch this programming directly on television, as previously mentioned, not everyone has access to the G4 network. If this is the case, you may be able to obtain similar programming from iTunes.  G4 has partnered with iTunes to offer Formula D podcasts. These podcasts are typically two minutes each.  Essentially, they are shortened versions of the programs that can be found on G4TV. As long as you have a computer and internet access, you should be able to view these podcasts. Each podcast, as well as the iTunes program, is free to download. Whether you do not have access to G4TV or they are not airing any programs when you want to watch, the iTunes podcasts are a great way to get your Formula D fix. 

To determine when the next Formula Drifting event airs on G4TV, you are advised to check your local listings.  You can also do this online, by visiting the online website of G4TV. That online website can be found at www.g4tv.com.  In addition to viewing the programming schedule, you can also learn more about drifting. Interactive features, as well as behind the scenes looks, and informational articles, all on Formula Drifting, can be found by visiting G4’s online website.
