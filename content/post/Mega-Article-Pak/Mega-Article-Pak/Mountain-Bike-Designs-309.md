Mountain Bike Designs

The designs for mountain bikes can be classified in
three categories based on suspension:

1.  Hardtail - A frame with no rear suspension, 
often containing a front suspension fork.
2.  Fully rigid - This is a sub type of hardtail, 
with a rigid fork.
3.  Dual or full suspension - These bikes offer a
front suspension fork and a rear suspension that
are integrated into the frame.
4.  Soft tail - Offers a frame with a small amount
of rear suspension, normally less than a full
suspension frame.

The different designs of bikes in mountain biking
will offer you what you need for your unique style
of riding.  You'll want a different bike for 
different terrain, such as cross country or 
downhill.  As the terrain changes, you'll want to
make sure you have the right bike for the job.

Mountain biking is different than any other sport, 
offering you plenty of excitement and thrills.  
If you are new to mountain biking, you'll find the
different designs to be very enticing yet very
challenging at the same time.  Each design serves
a purpose with mountain biking, even some that
excel on the trails.

There are also several other designs which reflect
on the manny challenging disciplines in the sport
of mountain biking.  No matter what type of 
mountain biking you like to do, there are bikes
for that specific discipline.

If you are new to mountain biking, you'll want
to check out the many designs and types of biking
before you purchase a bike.  Mountain biking can
be a lot of fun and excitement, although it can
also be very dangerous if you don't have the 
right bike for the terrain.  Before you decide to
buy a bike and hit the trails, make sure you 
have the right design of mountain bike for the
riding you are planning on doing.
