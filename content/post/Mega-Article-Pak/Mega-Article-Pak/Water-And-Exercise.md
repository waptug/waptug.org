Water And Exercise

The human body is made up of over 75% of water, and
as we all know, we cannot live without water.  The
fact is, we can only survive for a total of 3 days
without water.  Water has however, been replaced in
most diets by soft drinks and other sugar sweetened
refreshments.  Keep in mind that water is a healthier
and necessary for leading yourself towards a better
health and longevity.

Your own personal need for water can vary greatly
due to exercise, weight, and temperature.  Research
has proven that over 2/3 of adults don't get the 
water they need on a daily basis.  By drinking water
on a regular basis you can replenish your body and
keep it well hydrated and functioning as it should be.

A majority of us wait until we are thirsty before
we drink water.  Keep in mind, this way isn't a 
reliable gauge of the water needs for the body.  By
the time you are thirsty you have already lost two
of more cups of the body's water supply.  Therefore,
drinking water regularly is much better than simply
waiting until you are thirsty.

It is very important that you don't substitute 
beverages with alcohol and caffeine for water.  The
reason behind this is that those types of beverages
act as a diuretic and can cause you to lose more
weight through increased urination.  You may think
and feel as if you are getting more water through
these beverages, although the fact is that you 
are letting it go almost as fast as you consume it.

Anytime you exercise, you need more water. Due to
perspiration, your body will lose quite a bit of
water.  For each pound lost due to exercise, you need
to drink 2 cups of water.  Even when you lay down
to sleep, your body loses water.  By drinking a 
glass or more of water before you go to sleep, you
can wake up with your body functioning as it should
be.

It should become more obvious that when you are sick
you'll need more water than any other tine.  When 
you get a cold or the flu, your body can become
dehydrated quite quickly.  You can help to prevent
this by drinking more water at times when you become
sick.

There are several mixed opinions as to whether 
purified water will actually provide benefit.  This
is a subject you should explore yourself as you 
determine the best type of water for yourself.  

Always make it a habit to drink water on a daily 
basis.  You should keep a bottle of water with you
at all times and drink it throughout the day.  You
should also teach yourself to drink water instead
of other beverages that don't replenish the nutrients
your body needs.
