Internet Marketing with an E Newsletter

One very popular Internet marketing strategy is to publish and distribute an e-newsletter on a regular basis. E-newsletters are essentially emails which may contain content, graphics, links and subtle forms of advertising. In general e-newsletters should be informative in nature and useful to the recipient but should also serve some type of marketing purpose as well. This article will examine e-newsletters and explain how they can be used effectively as a marketing strategy.

The first item to consider when attempting using an e-newsletter as a marketing strategy is the distribution list for the e-newsletter. This is very important because you want to ensure you are distributing your e-newsletter to recipients who will be interested in your products and services and will likely view the e-newsletter as worthwhile instead of viewing it as spam. Using deceptive tactics to harvest email addresses and sending out your e-newsletters blindly to a large audience is not a good marketing strategy. This strategy is not worthwhile for a couple of reasons. Most importantly this type of strategy does not help you to reach your target audience. You may reach some members of your target audience by accident but are not likely to reach a large population of this intended audience. 

Additionally, sending your e-newsletter unsolicited to a large audience with no interest in your products and services will likely result in your e-newsletter being viewed as spam. This can have more serious consequences than simply being a wasted effort. Specifically, recipients of your e-newsletter may block your email address or even report you to their Internet service provider as a spammer. This can have damaging consequences such as loss of business or even harsher penalties.

A better way to establish a distribution list for your e-newsletter is to set up a forum for interested potential customers to register to receive additional information from you. This could include registering with your website online and requesting to be added to your email distribution list or providing an email address and requesting additional information in some other manner. Sending your e-newsletter to recipients who have specifically requested more information is a good idea because these Internet users are already interested in your products and are likely to appreciate the e-newsletter instead of viewing it as spam.

The content of your e-newsletter should be considered next. This may include the actual copy contained within the e-newsletter as well as graphics, links and advertisements. Keeping direct advertising to a minimum is ideal but it is acceptable to use soft advertising techniques to promote your products or services. The copy in your e-newsletter should insightful information which will be useful to your readers. You may wish to include objective articles, product reviews or shorter articles containing useful tips. Links to your own website or to other websites which might be of use to your target audience can also be included. These links may come in the form of direct advertisements or the links may be embedded in the copy of the e-newsletter when appropriate. 

If you plan to utilize an e-newsletter to promote your products or services, you should consider hiring an experienced writer to create the content for your website. This will help to ensure you are providing your readers with top quality content. Likewise if you intend to include graphics you should have a graphic designer assist you to ensure your e-newsletter looks professionally put together.
