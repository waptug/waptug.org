Universal Studios Tours Height Requirements

Universal Studios is a great deal of fun – for most 
people. However there are some who simply will 
not enjoy a day at Universal Studios Tours – 
young children specifically. If you are planning a 
vacation to Universal Studios, you should take 
the height requirements into consideration – or 
you could end up having a miserable time.

First, you must be forty-eight inches tall to ride 
Revenge of the Mummy. You must be forty six 
inches tall to ride Jurassic Park, and you must be 
at least forty inches tall to ride Back to the Future. 
If you or your child do not meet these height 
requirements, you will not be allowed on the ride. 
There is a measuring stick that is used in the 
queue for each of these attractions. 

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that you can get 
by if you are just a half inch below the requirements 
– you can’t. These height requirements are in place 
to ensure your safety, and park staff members are 
trained to adhere strictly to these rules. Just a tip – 
high heel shoes won’t get you in either. At Universal 
Studios, they’ve seen it all!
