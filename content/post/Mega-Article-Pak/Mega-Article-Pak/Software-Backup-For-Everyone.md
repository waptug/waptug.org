Software Backup For Everyone

Backing up your data with almost any electrical device is crucial to keep things intact.  No computer or other electronic device is crash proof, problems can occur at any time.  All computers can crash at any given time, which normally results in the loss of all data that was stored on the hard drive.

The potential for less is the ideal reason to create a backup of your software and data.  How often or how much you need to backup things however, all depends on how you use your computer.  If your data is very important or if you use your computer for work, you may need to create a backup of your software on a daily basis, possibly even hourly for some people.

	3.  Disk image - This will give you the choice of backing up your entire hard drive or just the files that you select.
	4.  Unattended backup - Using this method, you can set the software that will create the backup to do all of the work, even if you aren’t around.
	5.  Snapshot backup - A snapshot backup will mirror your hard drive, backing up the images of your files.
