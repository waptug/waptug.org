What is a Hypoallergenic Giant Schoodle?

A hypoallergenic giant schoodle is a mix between a giant schnauzer and a standard poodle. This means that the dogs are medium size and have short hair, which is why they are considered good for those who suffer from allergies. Since they are a new breed of dog, there aren’t many breeders that currently have them. When looking for this breed, you should look on the internet to find a breeder that is certified to breed these dogs. 

Giant schoodles have an even temperament and are easy going. They are friendly to most people and have some of the same traits as the Giant Schnauzer and Standard Poodle. Like its relatives, the Giant Schoodle will have to be groomed often in order to protect it from skin problems and matting. Since the coat is springy and short, there are some cuts that will look better than others. Grooming every other month will keep your dog happy and healthy.

Most Giant Schoodles have a black coat. They enjoy getting exercise and will need to go outside at least twice a day. If you have a backyard or a park nearby, then you should consider buying one of these breeds. The Giant Schoodle is one of the first hypoallergenic dogs that is not a purebred. While its parents are both purebred dogs, the Giant Schoodle is considered a hybrid of the two breeds. This means that you may see other breeds being created soon since the demand for hypoallergenic dogs is on the rise. 

When looking for a hypoallergenic dog, you should take the breed into consideration. Some breeds need constant exercise, while others such as the greyhound are content to lie on the couch and run around once a day. You should have an understanding of what it will take to keep your new dog healthy and happy before bringing it home. If you are interested in a hybrid like the Giant Schoodle, you should ask breeders what the dog will need in terms of discipline, affection, exercise, and food. 

A Giant Schoodle can live to be at least twelve years old, which is another consideration you will need to think about. As the Schoodle ages, it may have health problems including arthritis, tumors, and cataracts. You will need to be prepared to take care of the animal for its entire life. This is a long term commitment that should not be taken lightly. Unlike other breeds, the Giant Schoodle bonds with its family quickly and is resistant to bonding with other people. 

You should also keep in mind that just because a dog is considered hypoallergenic, you may still suffer from allergies. While you may notice a reduction in allergy attacks, they may still occur. Keeping your home clean, making sure the dog is groomed often enough, and by buying an air filtration system, you will be able to breathe and enjoy your pet’s company more often. Having an allergy to dogs is very common and can be from hair, dander, saliva, urine, or dust that the dog tracks in from the outside.
