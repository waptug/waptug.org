Insurance Coverage When Chartering a Private Yacht

Have you recently decided that you would like to charter a private yacht? If you have, would you like to do so for an extended period of time, like a few days or a few weeks? While a large number of individuals choose to only charter private yachts for a few hours or a day, there are many more that make the decision to make a voyage out of it.  While is this great to do, there are a few factors that you will have to take into consideration.  One of those factors includes insurance.

When it comes to chartering a private yacht, there are a large number of individuals who do not even realize that they need to have insurance for themselves.  While insurance is always recommended, there are some instances where it is more important than others. For example, if you were interested in chartering a private yacht for a weeklong trip, insurance would be more important for you than it would be if you were only looking to charter a private yacht for a few hours. 

As it was stated above, there are a number of individuals who do not even realize that they should purchase insurance for themselves.  This is because many mistakenly believe that they are covered by the private yacht chartering company’s insurance.  The reality is that their insurance does not protect you or your belongings.  In the event of an emergency, a private yacht chartering company’s insurance would only likely cover their employees and their vessel.  Your belongings will not be covered.  Although there is a good chance that your yacht chartering adventure will be accident free, it is something that cannot be guaranteed. That is why it is at least advised that you look into purchasing insurance for yourself.

Speaking of purchasing insurance for yourself, the type of insurance that you will want to be looking for is known as travel insurance. Travel insurance, if you are unfamiliar with it, comes in a number of different formats. There are some extensive travel insurance packages. These extensive packages tend include reimbursement for trips that need to be cut short due to injuries or medical illnesses. While it is nice to have these types of travel insurance packages, there are certain types of coverage that you will want to have.  These coverage types are outlined below.

Accidental death is something that you will want as part of a travel insurance package.  As it was mentioned above, almost all private yacht charters result in successful, safe trips, but there is always a chance that an accident could occur.  Unfortunately, the chartering of a private yacht often means that you are out at the mercy of the waters.  This means that should an accident occur, the chances for grave results are high.  That is why it is advised that you have a travel insurance plan that includes accidental death coverage, just in case.

In addition to protecting yourself, you will also want to protect your belongings that you take with you.  Although it is advised that you leave many of your valuables safe at home, you may want to bring some items with you. If that is the case, you will want to make sure that your travel insurance covers all baggage that gets lost, stolen, or damaged. When examining this type of coverage, it is important that you thoroughly examine the fine print.  There are many insurance providers that limit the amount of money you are able to be reimbursed in the event that your baggage gets lost, stolen, or damaged.  

As you can see, travel insurance is important to any trip, but particularly the chartering of a private yacht.  The good news is that it can be acquired for a reasonable price.
