Getting a Good Deal on Children’s Clothing

Children grow at unbelievable rates, and sometimes it seems like their clothes no longer fit just overnight. Clothing isn’t cheap so having to budget for a new wardrobe isn’t easy. If you have several children then you know all too well the burden of coming up with money to buy all of the clothes they need before school starts and again in the summer time. Sure, you can save some money by passing clothing from one child to another but there are plenty of other ways to save money on children’s clothing.

Many stores offer buy one get one free offers throughout the year on jeans, shirts, and even shoes. While you may not think your child needs so many right then consider buying them the next size up. This way when you need bigger clothes for them you already have some stored away at home without having to rush out and spend whatever the going price is at that time for such items. 

Pay attention to the sales that take place throughout the year on children’s clothing. You will be amazed at the savings. In fact, the first place I look when I enter a retail store is the discount and sale racks that are generally placed at the back of the store. I have purchased swimsuits and swim trunks for my children as school time approaches for just a dollar or two instead of $10 or $20 a piece.

Winter jackets can cost from $50 to $200 dollars depending on where you purchase them from. I always buy extras for my children at the end of winter and never pay more than $20 for them. The same with summer clothing such as sandals and shorts. They go on sale as school approaches and I buy larger sizes to store until next summer. I use tight sealing storage containers for the clothing so it won’t get damaged. 

Sweaters for both boys and girls are a common item in the colder months, but it can be expensive for good quality ones. Buy them on sale and pack them away for next year. Try to avoid ones that offer seasonal colors or themes so that they can be used whenever the child needs one. Even paying $5 for a sweater that is regularly $30 is a very good deal in my book. 

My children and I make it a day of fun and games when it is time to change from one season to the next. We go through the containers of clothing and try on things to see what is a good fit. We also clean out clothes that don’t fit from their closets. This way we know exactly what items each child still needs to be ready for the season. 

To get good deals like these on clothing for children you need to be well organized and plan ahead. You may think it isn’t worth while to pay for items now that won’t get used for a year, but think about the overall savings. I have three children to buy winter jackets for so $20 each in about the cost of one when the next winter rolls around. This is the best way I know to keep my children dressed nicely but also to make it fit well into the budget I have to work with. 

Don’t forget to look at the sale pages for children’s clothing that are often found in the major newspapers on Wednesdays and Sundays. You may be able to pick up some great deals at these one day sales, but make sure it really is a sale and not just a promotion of their regularly advertised prices. To get the most out of the clothing you purchase, try to avoid trendy themes that may not be in style when your child is able to wear them next year. Stick to basic styles and colors.
