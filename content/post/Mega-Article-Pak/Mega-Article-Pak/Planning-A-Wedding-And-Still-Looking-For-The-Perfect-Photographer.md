Planning A Wedding And Still Looking For The Perfect Photographer

Wedding photography is perhaps the most important field because these are the special moments in life we want to capture.  Portraits are important and often play a major roll in wedding photography, but there are more to the wedding and finding the perfect photographer.  Below are several tips to finding the right photographer for you.

Equipment is one of the most important aspects.  There are new photographers who will start out not being able to afford a lot of camera equipment, lights, tripods and so on.  This doesn’t make them a bad photographer, but it can mean they will miss important wedding moments when they are reloading the film on one camera.  In today’s world a wedding photographer should have at least one digital camera at the professional grade and two film cameras.  A successful photographer will have enough cameras to put appropriate lenses on and be able to switch memory cards in the digital camera with ease.  They should also have a video camera run by another person to capture the entire wedding.

Experience will determine the cost of the photographer.  Most photographers who have been on the circuit longer will charge between $3000 and $10,000 for wedding photographs.  It all depends on the type of package you will want and how many assistants they will need to cover the entire affair.  Other photographers typically charge between $300- $3000 depending upon the package and their experience.  A well-known wedding photographer is going to cost more, just for the name.  These packages often denote their experience as well as the equipment they can use.  A digital camera does not cost film, but purchasing one can be expensive so most new photographers may charge a little more to replace the cost of the equipment.

Price of a wedding photographer should only be a moderate issue.  The top important aspect of a professional wedding photographer lies in their photography skills.  They will instantly walk into the places your wedding and reception will take place and have ideas of the placement of equipment and lighting.  They will also be able to show you a portfolio of past weddings.  Wedding photography is about the moments that pass between your family and yourselves.  The moment where you are looking at your betrothed with love written on your face when you think no one else is looking will make the best photographs.  A wedding photographer needs to see these moments and capture them as well as obtain the portraits.

Wedding photography is often seen around the home with the portraits.  The portraits of the bride holding her flowers, the wedding party posing, and the groom and bride together.  The traditional wedding photography will include the hands with the shinning wedding bands placed on a pillow or wrapped around the bride’s waist.  The arrangement of the wedding couple is as important as the photograph.  The wedding photographer should be able to pose you while capturing the light and background.

Photography is an intricate profession and when you have an important day such as a wedding you will want the best.  You may have ideas of the photographs you want and the wedding photograph will be glad to help bring those ideas to fruition.  Photography is about lighting, catching those unguarded moments, and creating memories that will last forever.
