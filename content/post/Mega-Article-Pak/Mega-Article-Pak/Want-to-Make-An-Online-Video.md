As previously mentioned, comedy skits are also a great theme to try for your first online video.  With comedy skits, you can do something as simple as traditional jokes or you could even make your own.  When doing a comedy skit, it is important to keep your jokes in mind.  If you are planning on telling obscene jokes or ones that may be considered offensive, you may want to post a warning with your video. This warning, often included in the video title, should be used to warn internet users to view your video with caution. When it comes to making a comedy skit, even just a short one, you should not only be able to get experience making online videos, but you will also be giving most internet users a good laugh.

In the event that you are a musician, you and your band could record your own music video and share it with the rest of the world. In addition to working on a rehearsed video, you could also just randomly record.  By carrying your camcorder around with you, you never know what shots you could get.  Many of the most popular videos found online aren’t really of anything in particular.  In most cases, it seemed if someone just happened to be in the right time, at the right place, with a camcorder.
