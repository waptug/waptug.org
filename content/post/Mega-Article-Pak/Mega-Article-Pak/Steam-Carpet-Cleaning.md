Steam Carpet Cleaning

The process of steam cleaning your carpet involves 
hot water being fed to a spray extraction tool or
wand, coupled to a pump vacuum power unit.  The 
cleaning solution is injected under pressure deep 
into the carpet through water jet nozzles.  

The water will then penetrate the fiber all the way
down to the backing.  This action will loosen any
embedded soil, remove oil and grease deposits, and
get your carpet cleaner than it has ever been.

There are many types and makes of steam carpet 
cleaners available on the market, ranging from small
portables to the large and very powerful truck 
mounted units.  The principle is the same no matter
what model you pick.

The models that are truck mounted are designed so
that only the hose and the wand are taken into the
area being cleaned.  These units are very powerful,
delivering hot water and generating a high vacuum
recovery that can be powered by diesel fuel, gas,
propane, or even by the motor of the truck.

Most carpet manufacturers, fiber producers, and
professional cleaners endorse this process for 
achieving soil removal efficiency.  With the present
state of art equipment and technology, we are more
than capable of high production and cleaning of 
carpet.

The real disadvantage to steam carpet cleaning are
the problems that are associated with over wetting
and longer drying times.  These can be eliminated
however, by a skilled operator who uses equipment
that is well maintained and in good overall 
operating condition.

Currently, there are two methods being used with
steam carpet cleaning.
	1.  This method involves a traffic
lane cleaner being sprayed onto the traffic lanes
and then agitated into the fibers.  The entire
area is then cleaned by using a hot water extractor
that has a cleaning solution being injected into
the fibers through the wand.
	2.  The second method involves a free 
rinse emulsifying pre-spray being sprayed onto the
entire carpet, then agitated into the fibers.  

Steam cleaning procedures
	1.  Prepare the equipment and supplies.  In
a pump or power sprayer you should mix the free
rinsing pre-spray.  In the solution tank of the
extractor, mix the rinsing agent.
	2.  If you have a lot of furniture to move,
make yourself a floor plan.
	3.  If the area being cleaned has furniture,
you should remove as much as possible.
	4.  Thoroughly vacuum the carpet.  If the
pile is crushed or matted, use a pile brush to
loosen the soils which will make vacuuming more 
effective.
	5.  Pre-spray a good amount of the pre-spray.
	6.  Using a grooming tool, agitate the pre
spray deep into the fibers then let it sit for 10 - 
15 minutes, making sure that it doesn't dry out.
	7.  Extract the area using a portable, truck
mounted, or automatic carpet cleaner.
	8.  Repeat steps 5 through 7 until the
entire area has been cleaned.
	9.  Groom the cleaned area, replace all
furniture that was removed, then clean all equipment
that you used.
