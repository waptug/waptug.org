How to Best Operate Your Indoor Remote Control Helicopters

This article is meant to educate the reader about indoor remote control helicopters, including the pleasure of owning them, but also the danger of flying indoor remote control helicopters in homes with lots of glass windows.  I must say that although these helicopters is a pleasure to own, I personally have broken quite a few windows with helicopters that claimed to be indoor remote control helicopters, but ultimately turned out to be typical outdoor helicopters that were not meant to be flown indoors.

You see, the indoor remote control helicopters are usually made of a foam rubber or other soft, cushiony substance that allows them to bump into furniture, walls, or windows without harming the home or the helicopter.  In contrast, helicopters that are meant for the outdoors are usually made of plastic or metal and are used to fly at fast speeds in large, open areas where the worst thing they could do is bump into a tree (and in this case, one also must be careful that they don’t fly their helicopter near a power line).

I personally have had more fun with outdoor helicopters, but the main benefit of an indoor helicopter is that you can play with them even if you live in an area with frequent inclement weather, or with snowstorms.  Of course, if your home has lots of knick knacks and breakables, you need to be careful even with indoor remote control helicopters because even though they may not break items outright, they can knock them down so that they break when they hit the floor.  But in any case, it’s always best to purchase a helicopter that you feel comfortable working with and that you feel adept at flying.  Don’t purchase indoor remote control helicopters because you think you can just fly them into anything and not have to worry about the consequences.  This is not the case with any model of helicopter you buy.  You even need to consider the fact that some helicopters generate lots of wind energy when they fly, and you might knock papers around and create quite a mess.

Just make sure that wherever you fly indoor remote control helicopters—and the same is true for the outdoor versions—that you check with the owner of the home and make sure that they know the potential consequences of bumping your helicopter into one of their items.  That said, indoor remote control helicopters are often the safest, and unless you are a real daredevil, you can usually have a good time with them and not break anything.  Plus, they are often cheaper than the classic plastic or metal outdoor helicopters because they are made of cheaper materials and do not really require the manufacturer to be adept at creating them—lots of the fabrics of indoor remote control helicopters can be stretched and manipulated without the possibility of them breaking.  There are all things to consider.

But certainly, if you are thinking about purchasing a helicopter, know that you are in good company.
