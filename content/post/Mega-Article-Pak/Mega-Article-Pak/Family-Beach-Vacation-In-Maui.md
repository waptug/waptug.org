Family Beach Vacation In Maui

Located on the southwest side of Maui, the Fairmont
Kea Lani Maui overlooks the amazing waters off of
Polo Beach.  The beach here is the center of all
water activities such as snorkeling, sailing,
kayaking, and even windsurfing.

Visitors here can play on any of the Wailea Golf
Club's three championship golf courses or enjoy
a game of tennis at any of the 14 courts the tennis
center offers.  Parents that are tired can get some
much deserved personal time with a massage at the
Spa Kea Lani.

The resort accommodations are either suites or 
villas, so there is no need to squeeze your entire
family into a tiny room.  There suites here are a
minumum of 840 square feet and offer a separate
living room and marble bathroom with a separate
tub for soaking.

The private two levels villas here are minutes 
away from the beach and are between 1,800 - 2,200
square feet as well.  The villas are ideal for 
larger families as they offer a full service
kitchen and a private courtyard with a plunge pool
and barbeque for grilling out.

Keiki Lani is also the hotel's activity center 
for kids as well.  It's a state licensed facility
for children between the ages of 5 and 13, giving 
parents a break from watching their kids.  Here,
children can enjoy painting coconuts, building 
sand castles, exploring the tide pools, learning
how to dance hula, and even making real flower
leis.  The activity center can accommodate up to
19 children, so be sure to call ahead and reserve
a space for your children.

Rates
The rates for stay start at $325 per night for a 
suite.  One of the benefits of a family vacation
here is the special deals that are almost always
available.  The Fairmont Kea Lani Maui has several
packages available for family vacations.  

If you are planning to explore the island with
the kids, you'll save a lot of money by taking a
package that includes a free rental car.  This way,
you can explore the island at your will without
having to worry about paying any extra money.

For a family vacation, Maui is truly a one of a
kind destination.  There are many different things
to do here for everyone in your family, even if they
are indeed hard to please.

Once your family experiences Maui and everything
there is to offer, you'll never look at beach 
vacations the same way again.  Maui has that kind
of power - especially when it comes to warm weather
and pleasing people from all over the world.
