Home Security Advice

When the topic of home security springs to mind, most people seem to think of burglar alarms and little to nothing else.  Alarms can be a great way to protect your home, although they are only a small part of what makes up an effective home security system.  Burglar alarms are a key to protecting your home – although there are other things you’ll need as well.

Believe it or not, the windows are actually the key to home security.  Homes that have poor constructed windows tend to get broken into a lot more than homes with secure and sturdy windows.  When you are dealing with your windows, you should make sure that you have tough glass and locks that fit to the windows.  When you are away from home, you should always make sure that your windows are locked.  Even though some windows may be hard to reach, you should always lock them.  Burglars make a living out of stealing – and they will normally find a way in if they see the opening.

Along with the windows, doors are also known to be a weakness of security around the home.  Doors should always be strong and sturdy, complete with tough locks that aren’t easy to force open.  If you have a spare key, you should be careful where you leave it.  Losing your keys can also make you a target, especially if you have anything on your key ring that reveals your home address.

To better protect their homes, most people choose to invest in a home surveillance system.  These systems are great for monitoring the home, as they can record video and keep it stored for you to view later.  If you travel a lot, a home surveillance system can be an ideal way to keep a check on your home while you’re away.

Guard dogs are also common with home security as well.  A guard dog can protect your home from burglars, thieves, and other types of trouble.  Guard dogs can be very handy to have around, as most dogs are more than capable of scaring away trouble with their bark.  The only downside to guard dogs is the fact that you’ll need to train them and ensure that they always have food and water.

Last, but certainly not least are burglar alarms.  Burglar alarms can be effective to an extent, although they are primarily good for scaring thieves away.  If you put an alarm in a visible location from the outside of the home, most burglars won’t even attempt to enter your home.  Even though burglar alarms are great for scaring off thieves – you’ll still need to have other areas of your home safe and secure as well to get the most of your home security.
