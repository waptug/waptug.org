Hamoa Beach Vacation Paradise

The black sand of Hamoa Beach is one of the best
beaches on Maui.  The water isn't too rough, there
are no rocks in the surf, the crowds are minimal,
and the nearby scenery is amazing.  For a beach
vacation, Hamoa Beach is tough to beat.

Hamoa Beach is about a five to ten minute drive
from the town of Hana.  The drive is easy to make,
with lots of great scenery along the way.  There 
isn't a parking lot, so you'll need to park on
the side of the road and walk down the steps to 
the beach.  Parking isn't normally a problem 
because the beach is never crowded.

There is a beach hut on Hamoa Beach that rents
body boards, snorkeling equipment, and even gives
out towels to guests of the Hotel Hana Maui.
There are also beach chairs and umbrellas that
are for guests only.

Unless you are a guest and want a chair, the best
spot on Hamoa Beach is on a big towel right in
the center of the black sand.  There's plenty 
of shade on the beach, so you won't have any 
trouble getting out of the sun when you have had
your fill of it.

The water at the beach isn't rough and there are 
no rocks to cut you as you swim.  The waves here
can get quite large, although they are easier
to swim in than other beaches on the island.  

Hamoa Beach is an excellent beach vacation spot,
offering something for the entire family.  There
is always something going on here, no matter
what time of year you visit.  For a beach vacation
that never lets up - Hamoa Beach is where you
need to be.
