that move horizontally between the lower and
the upper track.

are made from aluminum and make up a wall of
protection in the shutter.  If you have a 
large area to cover, it can half a center 
opening with half of the shutter moving to the
right and the other half to the left.

flying debris, forced entry, and even the 
dreaded hurricane.  Storm shutters will also
give you more privacy and help to reduce noise.
