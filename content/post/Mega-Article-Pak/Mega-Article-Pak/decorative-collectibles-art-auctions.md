Decorative Collectibles at Art Auctions

I have found many decorative collectibles at art auctions over the years.  I have a display cabinet filled with all of my finds.  My favorite of all of the decorative collectibles are Pendelfin rabbits.

Pendelfin rabbits captivated my interest when I was a young girl.  My dad was stationed in England and my mother bought me my first of many decorative collectibles at an art auction.  The bookends that she bought for me are extremely rare and I recently had them appraised at more than fifteen hundred dollars.

I’ve been searching at art auctions in my area every time that decorative collectibles are advertised as being up for sale.  My greatest hope is that I can find a Pendelfin item named The Shoe.  I’ve been looking for this particular piece for about five years.

The larger pieces of decorative collectibles seem to get really expensive really fast at an art auction.  I’ve seen three people at once bidding up the Pendelfin rabbits to a point where the price is just out of my reach.  I love these rabbits, but I have to stay on budget when I attend an art auction.

There is one Pendelfin item that I found at an art auction early in my collection that I spend a lot more money than I wanted to.  I just had no idea how much a love of decorative collectibles could end up costing.  The item I bought was a three inch by four inch little plaque with Robert the rabbit depicted.

I sell decorative collectibles with online art auctions.  I find the items at art auctions and sales that I attend in person.  I have never resold a piece of Pendelfin.  I keep them in my own private collection.  My husband bought me a Pendelfin figurine named Auctioneer.  I love it.

Almost all of the rabbits produced by Pendelfin are small.  These decorative collectibles have retained their value for a long time.  Art auctions are a great place to hunt for really cool pieces that are larger and rare.  I’ve been looking for one named Aunt Ruby for a couple of years, now.

Aunt Ruby is one of the large size rabbits.  I already have Uncle Soames and Mother.  These were actually some of the first pieces of decorative collectibles.  I found them at an art auction I attended with my husband before we married.

There was an anniversary piece put out by Pendelfin.  I don’t think that it is worth what I keep seeing it for new and in stores that sell decorative collectibles.  I’ll just keep looking for it at a reasonable price at the art auctions I attend.

I was so excited when I found two big pieces of Pendelfin decorative collectibles at the last art auction I attended.  I bought both the one named Toy Shop and the one named The Castle Tavern.  They look great with all of the others that I’ve bought and won at auctions over the years.

My sister called me from an art auction last year to tell me that she had found a treasure trove of decorative collectibles.  She said that there was one lot that contained nine Pendelfin pieces.  I authorized her to pay up to four hundred dollars for the lot because some of the pieces were chipped.  I was shocked when the lot went for eighty dollars, the opening bid.
