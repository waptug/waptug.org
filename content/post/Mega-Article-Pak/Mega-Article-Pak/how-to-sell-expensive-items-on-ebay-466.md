How to Sell Expensive Items on eBay

Selling expensive items on eBay is really no different 
than selling low cost items. Essentially, no matter 
what you are selling, it all comes down to how you 
market the item. This doesn’t mean you have to 
surf around the Internet placing ads here and there – 
when it comes to eBay auctions, the marketing is 
all done at the eBay website. Basically, when you 
set up your auction, you are setting up an 
automated marketing campaign.

First, you must determine what the value of your 
item is, in three different ways. This will help you 
determine what your reserve price is. On eBay, the 
reserve price is the lowest price that you are willing 
to accept for your item. First, have your high priced 
item evaluated to determine what the actual market 
value is. Next, research similar items from past 
auctions at eBay to see what price those items sold 
for. Finally, determine what the value of the item is to
you. With this information, you should be able to 
determine the lowest amount you are willing to sell 
the item for.

Set your reserve price, and then set your opening bid 
price lower than $50 – no matter how high your 
reserve price is. This is a marketing tactic. It will be 
hard to attract potential buyers to an auction for an 
item selling for hundreds or thousands of dollars – 
but getting them to an auction where the opening 
bid is only $50 is quite simple. Remember, you don’t 
have to sell the item to anyone who bids less than 
your reserve price – unless you choose to do so at 
the close of the auction. This method of price setting 
resembles marketing gimmicks used by offline 
businesses that are simply designed to ‘get customers 
in the door.’

Work hard on the description for your listing. Use 
words that really describe your item well. Provide as 
many details as possible, including details that prove 
the authenticity of collectible items. Include pictures 
of the item as well. Do not try to deceive potential 
buyers! If the item has marks or scratches, simply 
be honest about it, and make sure that the pictures 
convey this as well. State how the item will be 
packed and shipped. Also let potential buyers know
 that shipping insurance must be purchased as well
 – in case the item is damaged once it leaves your 
possession.

For higher priced items, most eBay buyers feel more 
comfortable using an escrow service. Offer this as 
an option in your auction, with the understanding that 
the buyer must pay for the service. This protects both 
parties from fraud, and it makes many buyers more 
open to spending the money to obtain the item. 
eBay has partnered with an escrow service that is 
commonly used for high ticket items.
