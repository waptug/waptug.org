Carpet Cleaning

Although vacuum cleaning can remove a majority of the
dry soil, it is also necessary to clean your carpet
on a frequent basis to remove the oily, sticky soil
that builds up in the pile as a result of odors and
dirt that is tracked in from outside.  

If you can clean the carpet before it becomes too
bad, the cleaning chore will be easier to do and a
lot more successful.  There is a myth that is totally
false, which states that cleaning the carpet before
it is necessary will get it dirtier faster.  The
carpet with the typical household should be cleaned
every 12 - 18 months depending on the number of
people living there and the amount of traffic that
walks on the carpet.

The choice of the right vacuum is important as 
well.  There are some vacuums that will leave 
residues behind, which will promote re-soiling and
basically defeat the whole purpose of household
cleaning.  

Professional carpet cleaners
It is in your best interest to use professional
cleaners simply because their experience will enable
them to do a much better job than you can do yourself.
The equipment they use has more extraction power 
than the units available to you, and the carpet
will dry faster as well.  They know the cleaning
agents to use, and they know the differences in
carpet construction and fibers.

Doing it yourself
If you have made the decision to rent a steam
cleaning machine and do the job yourself, you 
should check on several systems before you make a
selection.  Most of the units available for rent 
don't clean well enough and may end up damaging
your carpet.  Therefore, you should always consider
the following:
	-  Several rental companies offer cleaning
equipment that is similar to what the professionals
use.  The equipment should have enough vacuum
power to allow the carpet to dry within 12 hours
of cleaning.  You should always avoid rental units
found in retail and grocery stores that don't 
have the power to extract the cleaning solution
from the carpet fast enough, as it can actually
damage the carpet due to over wetting.
	-  Make sure you avoid over wetting the
carpet.  Any prolonged dampness can lead to mildew
growth and bacteria in the carpet, or cause a
seperation of the backing.  A wet carpet that stays
this way for longer than 24 hours can develop
problems.  You can control this by using proper
equipment and the right training.
	-  Carpets that have stain resistant 
treatments have to be cleaned with products that
are formulated for this very purpose, or the stain
resistance will be impaired and the warranty will 
be voided.  Never use cleaning or spotting solutions
that contain bleaches as they can mess up the color
of the carpet.
	-  Never use any silicone based treatments
on the carpet.  
	-  You can help to reduce the drying time
by using several fans to move the air around the
carpet.  You can use a dehumidifier as well, as
it will pull moisture from the air.  

Hot water extraction
The hot water extraction system is highly recommended,
as it considered to be one of the best methods 
for carpet cleaning.  Also known as steam cleaning,
the process consists of spraying a mixture of water
and detergent into the pile and recovering the 
water and soil with a powerful vacuum that puts it
into a holding tank.  You can use a truck mounted
unit or a portable self contained unit as well.  This
method is easily one of the best, and is ideal for
soiled carpets or pet stains that you have yet to
get out of the fibers.
