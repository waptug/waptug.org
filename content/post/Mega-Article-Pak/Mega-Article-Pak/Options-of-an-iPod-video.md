Options of an iPod video

	
The new iPod video, which is of a convenient shirt or pocket size, has many options and some of them are absolutely surprising. Apart from the usual options of the iPod – music player, photo viewer, and voice recorder – the new iPod video has several options that may seem revolutionary for some people or useless for others. These options make an iPod video first of all a video playback device, photo and music device. For example, it plays music videos, even TV shows or, a remarkable initiative – ABC hits like “Lost” and “Desperate Housewives”. Even Pixar shorts and popular Disney are available for the new iPod video.  
      
The new iPod video is a refined device with refined features for the interested customers. The new video features are very well thought out and displayed on a thinner iPod. Besides, the resolution is up to 320x240, fact that may represent an advantage in an era of other handheld video options. On the other hand, the new iPod video has better volume with no static or clipping when turned up to the maximum volume. You may also connect you iPod to the home or car stereo without worrying about the quality of the sound. 
      
Another option concerns the fact that the new iPod video has a large color screen. Besides, the display is refined, as you may see the images even in bright indoor light or in the sunlight. Another aspect regards the battery life that may last 14 hours or even 20 – it depends on the model you choose.  
      
The specialists suggest that the main use of the iPod video will be the short videos, funny elements taken from life. The argument for this fact is that the iPod videos are too small for being watched by too many people at the same time and require more attention than the audio programs. A possible disadvantage is the fact that many iPod videos may be used by teenagers for porn videos, fact that may help the porn industry to develop its programs and success.
	
Some other options may come immediately after the complete success of the presented ones. The great success may be ensured for the company and especially for this daring project without even having clear and certain proofs from the consumer market. Besides, the options on the new iPod video may be tempting for those who prefer not to mix the mobile with video options. This aspect may represent the next step in the video evolution although there are lots of skeptic opinions about these new trends in the television industry.
	
Another important aspect of the new options of the iPod video is the fact that you may encode video from a DVD. You may also connect the iPod video to a TV and for this operation you may need some items – an iPod compatible video, a video capable iPod and an A/V cable. The next operations concern your skills in selecting the right options on your video iPod: you should choose video setting from the menu, then you have to adjust the video playback style you need. Another step concerns the TV signal specific for your country. Special information regards the way you plug the red, yellow and white RCA plugs: the red one into TV yellow RCA jack, the yellow into the white one and the white into the red RCA jack.
