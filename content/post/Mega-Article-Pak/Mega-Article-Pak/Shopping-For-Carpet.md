Shopping For Carpet

Shopping for carpet is something that has never been
an easy task.  To most people, it is more of a chore
than fun.  For most people, shopping for carpet is
a dreaded experience that should be avoided at all
possible costs - although they aren't in this alone.

Once you realize that others feel the same way, its
time to go shopping.  Frieze is an excellent choice
of carpet, one of the most popular types that you 
can purchase even today.  Frieze offers you a lot
of benefits without having to compromise anything.

The following are points that you'll want to consider
when you evaluate the durability of the carpet:
	1.  75% twist
	2.  15% fiber type
	3.  10% density

Twist 
The twist type of carpet has a spiral shape.  It
is used via heat method that twists the yarn into
its permanent shape.  The fibers can have up to 
seven twists per yarn, as the more twists you have
the better.  The result in the end is a rustic
knotted look that is very appealing.

Fiber type
Frieze carpets are normally made with high quality
nylon yarn.  Nylon is one of the most popular 
and most widely used fiber types for wall to wall
carpets.  

Density
It is very interesting that several people use the
density of carpet as their primary factor in 
judging quality.  

As you may know, carpet can be too dense.  The
denser a carpet is, the harder it will feel, as
the fibers are compacted.  The fibers were meant
to wear on their sides rather than on the tops, 
as they need their room to move. 

To help you get a better idea of carpets and the
types that stand out, we'll take a look at several
of them below.

Gulistan
Gulistan is actually one of the top manufacturing
companies of frieze carpets.  The company was a
trendsetter early on with innovate styles and a
very impressive selection of colors and easy 
care.  Even though the company is one of the 
smallest in the world, it has proven it has what
it takes to compete, with it's high quality nylon
frieze that is popular even today.

Laura Ashley
The Laura Ashley company is a name that sports an
elegant English country look that continues to
grow and inspire.  The company brings a lot to
the table, from impressive carpets to bed linens,
paint, and upholstery fabrics.

Beaulieu industries
This company licensed the Laura Ashley name and
premiered close to two dozen products, which 
included a cool frieze carpet.  The company has
been very successful with their carpets, managing
to compete for several years.

The bottom line
Anytime you shop for carpet, no matter what the
style may be, you should always know what you want
and how it will fit in with your home.  Along with
frieze carpet, there are many other types such as 
Berber, loops, high pile, and others that will add
quite a bit to your home.  Your carpet is very
important, and therefore you shouldn't rush buying
it.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to get
assistance from a professional, friend, or a member
of your family.  Those that have experience with
carpet can be a great help when you purchase your
own, especially if you don't have a lot of 
experience.

By getting help when you need it, researching, and
just taking your time, you'll have no problems at
all shopping for a carpet.  Carpets can make or
break a home, which is why it is very important that
you know what you are buying before you make that
critical purchase.
