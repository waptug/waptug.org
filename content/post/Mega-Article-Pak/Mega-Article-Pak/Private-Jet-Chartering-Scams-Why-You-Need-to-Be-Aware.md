Private Jet Chartering Scams:  Why You Need to Be Aware

Are you interested in chartering a private jet in the near future?  If you are, have you already made your reservations or your travel arrangements yet?  If you have yet to do so, you will want to do so with caution. In today’s society, scams are at an all time high.  Although it is relatively uncommon to hear of a scam that involves the chartering of a private jet, these types of scams do exist. One of the best ways to avoid a private jet chartering scam is to be aware.

When it comes to the chartering of a private jet, you will need to find a private jet chartering company to do business with.  This is where the tricky part comes in.  There are some individuals who know just how profitable running a private jet chartering company is.  Unfortunately, some of these individuals claim to run a private jet chartering company or else they claim that they are a jet owner who is looking to make extra money, by allowing their jet to be chartered by individuals just like you.  The only problem is that some of these individuals do not actually own a jet.  Instead, they will claim that they do, accept your reservations, take your money, and leave you high and dry.  This is the main scam that you need to be on the lookout for. 

When it comes to determining whether or not an individual who claims to own a jet really has one or if the private jet chartering company that you want to do business with really does exist, you will have to do a little bit of research.  Unfortunately, there are many individuals who mistakenly believe that this only involves visiting the online website of the individual or private jet chartering company in question. While online websites are nice, they are relatively easy to make. In fact, just about anyone can make one.  That is why you will want to be cautious when examining the online website of an individual who claims to have a private jet available for charter or a private jet chartering company.  Of course, you will want to visit the online website, but you will also want to look elsewhere for additional information.

Online, there are a large number of online websites that are often referred to as scam websites or consumer reporting websites.  It is advised that you examine a few of these websites.  Their goal is to provide information to consumers, just like you, on individuals or companies that have a history of scamming other consumers.  If you were scammed, there is a good chance that you wouldn’t go down without a fight and many other consumers are the exact same way. That is why if you are looking to learn about a private jet chartering company or even just an individual who has a jet available for charter, you are advised to use these online resources.  A simple search with the name of the individual or private jet chartering company in question and you may be altered to any negative reports, should they exist. 

While claiming to have a private jet available for charter when there is actually no jet is the most common type of jet chartering scam, there are more.  Another one of these scams has to do with the service available.  One of the reasons why private jet charters are so popular is because they are luxurious; at least the jets being chartered are, in most cases.  These are some individuals and companies who claim to have a certain jet make and model.  There are also others who claim to have a jet that is in top-notch condition.  Unfortunately, some of these individuals are lying.  If you are chartering a private jet for your honeymoon or for your clients, there is a good chance that the overall condition or appearance of the jet being chartered is important.  By using the above mentioned method, of checking scam websites, you can determine whether or not an individual or a private jet chartering company has reputation for lying to customers or exaggerating the truth.  It is also advised that you ask for pictures, current pictures, of the jet in question.

As it was mentioned, private jet chartering scams are relatively uncommon; however, that doesn’t mean that they do not exist. That is why it is extremely important that you stay aware and know who you are doing business with.
