The Drifting Pretty Programs: Designed for Female Drifters

Are you a female is who interested in drifting?  Drifting is a popular sport that is centered on cars. Although drifting existed before 2003, it was relatively unheard of in the United States. In fact, only a limited number of areas, mainly in California, had events that were focused on drifting. It really wasn’t until 2003, when professional Formula Drifting was developed that the sport sparked in popularity.

You were previously asked whether or not you were a female who is interested in the sport of drifting. If you are like many other Americans, you may be wondering what your gender has anything to do with it.  Honestly, it shouldn’t, but, in some cases it does.  Unfortunately, Formula Drifting, both on a professional and amateur level has typically been perceived as a male dominated sport. Despite this perception, there are a fairly large number of women who also enjoy the sport and would like to participate in it.  Thanks to the development of a number of different programs, you can, if you choose to do so.

As previously mentioned, the development of a number of programs has made it easier for women to not only learn about the sport of drifting, but participate in it as well. Those programs are in a way, instructional programs, but many also work like social networks. These programs tend to create a group of women who are interested in learning as much as they can about drifting.  Since these programs, are almost always, just designed for women, many find that it is easier to learn and concentrate on the sport.

Although Formula Drifting has increased in popularity, as well as the training courses, you may have a difficult time finding a drifting program or course that is designed solely with women in mind.  Not all areas in the United States have them, but in the future, there is a good chance that they will.  In fact, in 2007, it is planned that the Drifting Pretty Program will expand on a national level. Drifting Pretty is one of the most well known drifting programs for women.  

When further examining the drifting programs offered by Drifting Pretty, you will find that you do not need to have any drifting or racing experience to join. This is important because many women are too afraid to enter a drifting program, especially if they have never participated in the sport before.  If this was what was preventing you from joining one of these educational programs, you are advised to eliminate it as a factor. In fact, you may even be better off than those who do have experience drifting. Not only may you find it easier to learn, but many have been taught the wrong or improper driving techniques.  With the right training, you will not have to worry about your past experiences negatively impacting your learning experience.

With Drifting Pretty, it is encouraged that you have a car, which should be a rear wheel drive, but it is not necessary right away.  However, to participate in the course, you will have to agree to purchase one, in at least three months.  In addition to taking part in Drifting Pretty’s training program, you may even be able to become a part of their team.  This team is the team that is used in competition. Only qualified individuals are able to become a part of this team, but with membership, hard work, and determination, there is a good chance that you may make it.
