Benefits of Registering With YouTube

Do you enjoy watching videos on YouTube?  Even if you have never visited YouTube before, you are urged to do so, as you will likely find it fun, exciting, and entertaining.  YouTube is a video sharing website which allows internet users, just like you, to upload and share videos that they have made.  Perhaps, the greatest thing about YouTube is that it is free.

When visiting the YouTube website to watch videos, you can do so without having to create a YouTube account.  Despite not being required to create a YouTube account, you may want to look into doing so, as there are a number of benefits to being a YouTube member.  Just a few of those benefits are outlined below.

One of the many benefits to registering for a free YouTube account is that it is relatively easy to do. When you signup for a free YouTube account, you need to provide a little bit of information about yourself.  This information includes your name, the country that you live in, your zip code, your date of birth, as well as your gender.  You will also need to create a YouTube user name for yourself, as well as a password.  Your password and user name will be used to log into your account.  Signing up for a YouTube account should take only a few minutes of your time, at the most.

Once you have created a free YouTube account for yourself, you can then begin to enjoy the many other benefits of having a YouTube account.  One of those benefits is the ability to rate videos that you watch, as well as leave comments.  As it was previously mentioned, you can watch videos on YouTube without having a YouTube account, but you cannot rate videos or leave comments for the video owner.  Rating YouTube videos gives other YouTube users an idea as to which videos are high in demand, which, in turn, can lead to more of your favorite videos being found on the YouTube site.  That is just one of the many reasons why you should not only signup for a free YouTube account, but also rate YouTube that you watch or leave comments.

In addition to being able to rate or review videos, registering for a free YouTube account also gives you the option of sharing your videos with other internet users.  Non-registered YouTube members are unable to upload and share any videos that they may have made.  If you have never shared videos online, you may want to think about doing so, as they are fun to make.  Many of the videos currently found on YouTube are comedy skits, video blogs, and candid videos.  All you really need to have is a video recording device, such as a cell phone, webcam, or camcorder, and a movie editing software program, which now comes standard on most computers.

As it was previously stated, creating a membership account with YouTube is free and it should only take a few minutes of your time.  If you enjoy using the internet as a source of entertainment, you will not only want to visit YouTube, but you will also want to take the few minutes needed to register for a free account.  In the end, you will likely be pleased with your decision to do so.
