Types Of Mountain Biking

As a sport or a hobby, mountain biking can be split
into 9 different categories.  These categories are
very versed in what they offer.  They are:

1.  BMX
BMX is a style where the bikes offer 20 inch wheels.
These bikes are commonly used at skate parks or
with dirt jumps.  Because of their smaller wheels
and shorter wheel bases, BMX bikes are much easier
to perform tricks and stunts with.

2.  Cross country
This type of mountain biking involves riding your
bike up and down hills.  Although it's the least
extreme form of mountain biking, most cross country
riders are very fit and go on long rides.  

3.  Cyclo cross
This is a cross between road and mountain biking.
These riders have to go over obstacles, cross through
rivers, and race on and off the course.

4.  Dirt jumping
Dirt jumping involves jumping the bike over large
man made dirt jumps then doing tricks while they
are in the air.  These jumps are normally close
together so riders can go over six or more jumps
in one run, gaining a flow to give them more 
speed for bigger jumps.

5.  Downhill
Downhill mountain biking involves racing downhill
as fast as possible.  This type of riding is very
intense and extreme, offering riders the chance 
for ultimate thrills and excitement.

6.  Freeride
Free riding involves finding the perfect line down
the mountain using all of the terrain to express
yourself.  These competitions are very popular, 
as riders can express themselves any way they see
fit.

7.  Single speed
No to be confused with fixed gears, this is a form
of cross country biking that's done using a bike
with only one gear and fewer components.  The idea
with single speed is simplicity.  The straight
chain line will provide efficient pedaling, and
the lack of components mean less mechanical 
problems and a lighter bike.

8.  Street and urban
This type of riding involves riding in urban areas,
ledges, and other types of man made obstacles.  
Riders of street and urban biking will do tricks
as well, such as stalls and grinds.

9.  Trails 
Trials are considered an aspect of mountain biking, 
although the bikes used look nothing like mountain
bikes.  They use 20 or 26 inch wheels and sport 
small, low frames.  Trail riders will hop and 
jump their bikes over obstacles, which requires
an extreme amount of balance and concentration.
