Pros and Cons of Selling on eBay

Are you interested in becoming an eBay seller? If you are, you are definitely not alone, as eBay has become a relatively quick and easy way to make money online. Each day, a large number of individuals use eBay to make extra money from home and a few lucky ones are even able to make enough money to support themselves or their families. Before you jump on the eBay selling bandwagon, you are advised to take a few minutes and examine the pros and cons of selling on eBay.

One of the many pros, or plus sides, to selling on eBay is the fact that is it is relatively easy to do.  Once you create an eBay account, you can start listing items that you have in your possession for sale right away.  When doing so, it is also easy to do.  eBay has a step-by-step process for listing items for sale, in traditional auction formats or buy it now formats.  In fact, eBay also has a program that lets you compile your auctions, with pictures and descriptions, when you aren’t even connected to the internet.  As soon as you connect to the internet, you can begin to upload your listings and have them start right away.  

Another one of the many pros to selling on eBay is that just about anyone can do it.  You don’t have to have big fancy, expensive items to sell on eBay.  In fact, a large number of those selling on eBay are just selling items that are taking up space in their homes; items they don’t want anymore.  If you are interesting in becoming an eBay seller, but you aren’t sure as to how much you can depend on eBay for income, you may want to think about testing the waters.  You can do this by listing the items have you have around your home for sale.  Items that tend to sell relatively well are lots, or groups, of toys and infant clothing.  

While there are a number of pros, or plus sides, to selling on eBay, there are also a number of cons, or downsides, to doing so as well.  One of the biggest cons or downsides to selling on eBay is the competition.  As it was previously mentioned, a large number of internet users have started using eBay to make extra money or even make a living. This is what leads to multiple auction listings for the exact same items.  While this is nice for the eBay buyers, it can hurt you as a seller.  When the supplier is higher than the demand, you may not make as much money off of your items as you had originally hoped to, if they even sell at all.

Another downside to selling on eBay is the fees associated with doing so.  In recent years, eBay has redone their fee structure, often to raise their fees.  Although these fees are still considered relatively low, they could put a damper on your profits, which alone are sometimes hard to come by.  Of course, there are ways that you can the most out of eBay fees.  For instance, if you have a “hot seller,” you could start your auction out at a low price, as the fees are less for doing so; however, you are taking a gamble, as you never have any guarantees as for how much your items will sell for.  Perhaps, the unknown is one of the biggest downsides to selling on eBay; you never really know if you are going to make money or even if you will end up losing money.

As you likely already know, the decision as to whether or not you want to become an eBay seller is yours to make, but, when making your decision, you are advised to keep the above mentioned points in mind. With a relatively equal amount of pros and cons, you may be wondering what your best option is.  For more accurate information, you may want to think about testing the eBay seller waters, as you are able to sell whenever you want, with no minimum auction requirements.
