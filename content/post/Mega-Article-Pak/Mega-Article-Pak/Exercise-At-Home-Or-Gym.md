Exercise At Home Or Gym

Making the decision of where you will go to exercise
is a very important step in reaching your goals of
fitness.  A lot of factors will go into this 
decision, and each one should be evaluated well
before you start exercising.  Once you have made 
a decision on where you will go to exercise, you
can move on to deciding how you plan to work out.

As you probably know, exercising at home has many
advantages.  The finance department is one of the
best advantages.  With the gas prices being what
they are today, it is quite obvious that you'll
save money on fuel as well as wear and tear on
your vehicle by choosing to exercise at home.

Memberships to a gym can often be quite expensive
and may include other things that you don't need
such as child care or swimming pools.  You also
won't need to be concerned about the latest 
trends of exercise gear as you most likely will
be exercising by yourself at home.

Keep in mind that working out at home does 
require a bit of financial obligation.  Even 
though you may plan to run, it is very important
that you have high quality running shoes.  This
statment applies to any type of equipment that 
you may purchase to use at home.  If you go
out and buy cheap equipment, you'll probably
end up getting hurt or getting frustrated because
you aren't making any progress.

Along with the financial gains, exercising at 
home may also help those who don't like to work
out in public.  If you are worried about how you
look in gym clothes, it is very comforting to
know that the only person who has to be with you
when you exercise at home is you.  Also, when
you exercise at home, you don't need to worry
about time at all.

Those of you who are motivated by being with
people you know or come to know while working
out away from home, a gym may be a better idea
than working out at home.  At the gym, you'll 
also more of a selection of equipment as well,
far more than you'll have at home.

If you need other services than just weights and
equipment, the gym may have just what you need.
If you plan to swim a triathlon, you'll find the
swimming pool at the gym to be just what you need
to prepare yourself.  Swimming is also a great 
exercise for your body and cardio, as it will work
muscles in your body that you probably didn't
even know you had.

Gyms will also offer you classes that you may find
very motivating.  If you attend class on a regular
basis, you may be motivated enough to continue
so you don't have to defend yourself when asked
where you've been or what you have been doing.
You can also meet new people in class, or just
help others along if you choose.

All in all, making the choice of exercising at 
home or at the gym is a choice you should make
based on your goals and personal preference.  The
most important decision you'll need to make is
to determine what type of environment you want
to be in and how you want to accomplish the
fitness goals in your life.

Once you have given it some thought and weighed
out the pros and cons, you'll have no problem
making the choice.  Always keep in mind that
once you've made your choice, you can always switch
if you aren't happy with the choice you made.
