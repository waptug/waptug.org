Valentine’s Day with a Friend

Valentine’s Day is traditionally a day for loved ones to celebrate their love for each other. However, not everyone is in a relationship each year when Valentine’s Day rolls around. This does not mean these people have to spend the day alone at home. Just because you don’t have a significant other on Valentine’s Day does not mean you can’t have a great Valentine’s Day. Spending Valentine’s Day with a friend can be a wonderful way to spend the day. You and your friend can do all sorts of things to celebrate Valentine’s Day and keep both of you from feeling left out on this holiday. This article will focus on some ideas for spending Valentine’s Day with a friend.

Going out to the movies can be a great way for friends to spend Valentine’s Day. Going to movies is not one of the most popular activities on Valentine’s Day so you will likely not have to worry about long lines or shows being sold out. If couples do choose to go to the movies, they are likely to flock to romantic movies so you and your friend can avoid the crowds by choosing a comedy or a science fiction movie you have been wanting to see.

Another fun way to spend Valentine’s Day with a friend is to get dressed up and go bowling. Bowling can be a lot of fun and it is not normally an activity couples tend to favor for Valentine’s Day. Try getting dressed up in your old prom attire and head to the local bowling alley. You will not only be having a lot of fun but you will also be making the activity seem more special. You can also try dressing for a specific theme such as the 50s or the 80s for your bowling outing.

You might be spending Valentine’s Day with a friend instead of a boyfriend or girlfriend but you still have to eat dinner on Valentine’s Day. Just because Valentine’s Day is traditionally for couples, doesn’t mean you and your friend can go out for a great dinner together on Valentine’s Day. If there is a new restaurant in town you want to try or a place you have always wanted to try, why not try it on Valentine’s Day. You will likely have to make reservations well in advance as going out to dinner is a very popular idea on Valentine’s Day but if you make your reservations in advance; you can enjoy your dinner in a fabulous restaurant on Valentine’s Day. 

If you and your friend are looking for something to do on Valentine’s Day, try volunteering to serve dinner in a homeless shelter that night. Holidays can be difficult times at shelters because there may be fewer volunteers than usual. While there are some who make an effort to volunteer on days such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, many people tend to overlook volunteer opportunities on Valentine’s Day because they are focused on enjoying a special evening with their loved one. You and a friend can spend the evening dishing out dinner to those in need. You will likely leave feeling as though you have made a difference in the lives of others which is a great way to spend Valentine’s Day.

Finally, if you and your friend are looking for a great way to spend Valentine’s Day, you might consider renting a bunch of movies and ordering a pizza. This can be a great way to spend time with a friend on Valentine’s Day. You won’t have to worry about getting all dressed up to go somewhere fancy. Instead you can just relax, be yourself and enjoy a great evening with an old friend. You can even rent a bunch of romantic movies, open a bottle of wine and toast all those who are out celebrating with a loved one this evening.
