Swimming Laps At Home

Swimming, as we all know, is one of the best exercises you can do for your body.  Swimming laps provides you with a great cardiovascular workout, and helps to keep your muscles toned.  Swimming works every muscle in your body, which can also help you to burn calories.  For many people throughout the United States, swimming is simply the best way to stay in shape and have fun doing it.

Although swimming is a lot of fun and a great way to exercise, it can be quite a chore going down to the local pool. The hours will vary from pool to pool, meaning that there are only certain times of the day and the week that you can go.  To make matters worse, the lanes are normally crowded, making it hard to get a proper workout.  Crowded lanes can make swimming a chore, especially if there are a lot of people around who are doing nothing but standing in the water.

If you like swimming laps but hate going to your local pool, you should look into getting a lap pool for your home.  Lap pools are a great addition to your home, with the only difference in a lap pool and residential pool being the size and shape.  Instead of the traditional kidney shape that home pools are known for, lap pools are long and narrow, giving you plenty of room to swim laps.  

With the shape being long and narrow, you can easily keep track of just how many laps you have swam.  Lap pools are normally just a few feet deep, meaning that divers shouldn’t invest in them.  They are intended for those who love to swim laps, lacking toys such as diving boards and slides, as the water isn’t deep enough.  Even though they are intended for hardcore lap swimmers, they are still ideal to jump in on a hot day and just cool off.

Lap pools are below ground pools, as you may already know.  They require a lot of digging for installation, and can cost quite a few bucks as well.  The prices will vary from area to area, although most top out around $30,000.  This is very expensive to say the least, although if you swim every day, you can easily make your money back if you count how much you spend going to the local pool.

If you simply don’t have the money but want to swim laps at home, you should look into a swim spa.  These spas resemble a hot tub of sorts, although you won’t have to dig up any of your yard to install them.  They work almost like a treadmill, using an adjustable current that pushes you back, so you keep swimming in virtually the same place.  You can get quite a bit of exercise using a swim spa, and it doesn’t take up a lot of room either.

Swim spas may be cheaper than lap pools, although they aren’t cheaper than traditional below ground pools.  They are still relatively new, and can be somewhat hard to find. More and more pool companies are including them though, so it may be just a matter of time before they come to your area.  You should contact your local company if you are interested, as they can be nearly impossible to maintain yourself.

With a lap pool or swim spa, you can swim as many laps as you like at home.  These types of pools are ideal for swimmers everywhere, and they can keep you as healthy as you like.  If you are interested in a lap pool or swim spa, simply contact your local pool company and get the ball rolling - you’ll be glad you did when you are swimming at home and not the local swimming hole.
