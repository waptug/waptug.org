Panasonic High Definition

With the growing popularity of the variable frame rate
VariCam HD Cinema cameras, HD production is on the
verge of changing HD video cameras as we know it.  The
low cost 24p editing and finishing on the desktop, is
what Panasonic likes to call a VariDigm shift.

It all starts inside of the camera.  The AJ-HDC27 from
Panasonic replicates several of the key features of
film based acquisition, which includes 24 frame 
progressive scan images, time lapsed recording, and a
wide range of film rates for amazing camera effects.
The VariCam also comes with CineGamma software that
permits Panasonic's HD Cinema camera systems to 
match the latitude of film stocks and effects.

Even though it all starts inside of the camera, it
doesn't stop there.  HD has been showing up in many
more places besides HDTV.  Panasonic is leading the
way with compact and affordable HD products.  All
across the world, you'll see Panasonic launching
HD products that are among the best and very affordable.

Broadcast
If your digital plans call for a transition to DTV
first then HDTV later on down the road, or if you plan
to take your station HD now, Panasonic has you 
covered by making HD both flexible and affordable.

Commercials
Whether your next commercial is a 30 second spot for
TV or a two minute commercial, shoot it on DVCPRO HD
without having to sacrifice quality.  The 24P at 720
progressive resolution from Panasonic makes this 
very possible.  

Corporate needs
The coporate level presentations demand the highest
level of image quality.  Professional presentations
begin with 720p and 1080i cameras from Panasonic.
By starting with the highest image quality available,
Panasonic ensures that you'll have everything you 
need to exceed your corporate needs and demands.
