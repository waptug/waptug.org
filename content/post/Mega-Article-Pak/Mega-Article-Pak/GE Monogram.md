GE Monogram

The GE Monogram collection has dozens of luxury appliances for the home. This line is more than the basic stove and refrigerator combo. The GE Monogram line includes everything from dishwashers to custom professional ranges. This collection of home appliances has the modern professional kitchen look which is very popular right now. All of the appliances are featured in stainless steel for a sleek look. 

GE Monogram items can be purchased at several retailers, though it may take a little work to find these stores. Most small upscale kitchen and bath stores have the line available for special order or for display in their showrooms. The GE website itself does have information and facts about the entire collection, but does not directly sell the appliances. There is a page, however, to find out where the closest retailer for the line is to you. Other online shopping comparison stores feature many of the models and at very good prices. One of the downsides of ordering online though is the unavailability to see the items in person. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to buy from a reputable retailer specializing in kitchen design. Big Box retailers such as Home Depot and Lowe's do not sell the GE Monogram line. 

The appliances come in wrapped in stainless steel and come with a fully seamless exterior for a sleek and elegant look. The stainless steel requires minimal cleaning and is much better than white or bisque appliances for surface durability and cleanliness. Because all of the appliances in the GE Monogram line come in only stainless steel it is easy to make sure all the appliances purchased match and are the exact same shade. 

Since the appliances are top of the line, and basically borderline professional grade the items in the GE Monogram line are on the high end of the price scale for household appliances. The basic refrigerator in the collection starts at about $3,000.00 depending on the retailer it is purchased from and the shipping fee's. Each item in the GE Monogram collection come with a warranty ranging from 1 to 12 years depending on the item and the part warranted. Extra warranties are readily available from the retailer for an extra fee. 

The GE Monogram collection is truly for the serious cook. A brand new home or an older home getting a face life would be perfect with a few of the updated appliances or the entire collection. Whatever is desired can be found with the GE Monogram collection.
