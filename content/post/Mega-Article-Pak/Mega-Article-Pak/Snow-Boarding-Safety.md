Snow Boarding Safety

When it comes to snow boarding I always tell people that the most important thing that you have to consider is safety. Not just your own safety, but also the safety of others, please read through my tips whether you are an expert snow boarder that has never crashed, or if you are about to hit the slopes for the first time in your life. Whatever level you are at, snow boarding safety is important to everyone.

Tip Number 1

Snow Boarding Equipment Safety

Before you jump on a board you need to check that it is working properly and that there is nothing wrong with the board itself. You also need to check that it is the correct size, and that it is holding your snow boarding shoes properly. The fact is that when you are snow boarding, you rely on the safety of the board just as much as you do on your own skill.

Snow Boarding Clothing

If you are hitting the slopes you have to understand that looking great and being safe are two different things altogether. If you are considering what kind of glasses to wear then do not think that your average sun glasses will do the trick. When you are snow boarding it is possible to be blinded by the snow, or least get sore eyes, so make sure that you have proper UV protection for a start. The next step is to think about how you are going to keep warm. This is very serious as if you are not warm then it can do more than just ruin a days snow boarding. What you should do is wear warm clothing underneath your snow boarding gear, and you also have to 100% make sure that everything that you are wearing is water proof. Everyone has had a snow ball fight wearing gloves that aren’t water proof. Were your hands cold? Of course they were. That is why your clothing must be waterproof. The next step when it comes to clothing is thinking about your safety, and by safety I mean padding. Yes folks, looking like a football player when you hit the slopes is the best thing to do, you can be sure to have a lot less pain when you fall. 

Snow Boarding – Food and Water

When you are snow boarding it is important that you eat and drink enough to get by. When you are going to the slopes it is not recommended that you eat too much before you start, but make sure that you have a healthy snack and be sure to drink plenty of water. People always think that because it may be cold, that they are not thirsty, however this a reason why many people get dehydrated on the slope. Did you know that more people suffer dehydration from skiing than from long jump, table tennis and dancing put together. Why is that? Because people need to think about what they need, rather than the usual signs that they may be thirsty. However, when people do go snow boarding accidents can happen and that is why you must be prepared. When you go on a long run you should take emergency food and drink. What I mean by this is around 1 litre of water and maybe cereal bars or something. What we are talking about is calories, fat and protein. This means that if anything bad was ever to happen then you could surely get something to eat and drink, and that will make you last longer in a bad situation.

When you are snow boarding safety is of paramount importance. Everyone can still enjoy themselves, but they should take precautions when they do. What I recommend is that people should take a mobile phone with them when they go snow boarding, and also bring a replacement SIM card. Why is that? Because if you do not get a signal out on the slopes then you will double your chances of getting one, if you have a phone that uses a different operator. A replacement battery is also a great idea, but only for emergencies!
