Organize Your Walk in Closet

Do you remember the day you moved into your new home, very excited about the walk in closet and all of the space it offered? Has it become a messy location now with so much stuff in it that you can’t find where anything is? It is an unwritten rule that they more space we have, the more stuff we will accumulate to fill it! 

Is your walk in closet full of items you really use or has it become a catch-all for those items you haven’t found a place for yet? It is very likely you don’t have any idea what all is residing in your walk in closet if it isn’t organized. Since a walk in closet is so much bigger than regular sized closets, you have many more options for customizing it to your liking while getting it organized. 

Start by removing everything from your walk in closet and sorting through it. This is going to be quite a chore, but very necessary if you are ever going to get that space in order. Get rid of anything that doesn’t belong in there. This includes clothing you don’t wear anymore and items that don’t belong in there. Next organize everything in piles according to how you will be dividing it up your closet. Take an inventory of the amount of space you need for each pile. This will help you determine the types of custom closet equipment to install for all of it. 

The possibilities are endless when it comes to customizing your walk in closet. Choose to add shelves, clothing rods, shoe racks, cubbies for your accessories, carousals for ties and belts, and hooks for hats and jackets. You have the option of adding a dresser or even building shelves to go into the walk in closet area. 

If you have the room in your walk in closet, you may want to add a bench or a chair for you to get dressed on. Some people put an island in the middle of their walk in closet. They use the top as a place to iron and to lay out their clothing for the next day. A full length mirror makes a very nice touch too. 

Since a walk in closet is so spacious, you may not know the best way to use the space you have. You can meet with a closet organizer consultant, look at magazines, and even use closet organization software to come up with a solution that you are happy with. The cost of such a project is going to vary based on several factors. The factors to consider include who will be doing the work, the quality of the materials you plan to use, and how much closet organization materials will be needed to complete the project. 

For those of you who have a walk in closet, use the maximum space you can get from it. This will take some hard work, planning, and investing. Make sure you use quality materials that are sturdy and durable. You want your custom walk in closet to remain organized for years to come. The time you will invest in getting this area of your home organized will be well spent. You will save time every day when you walk into that closet to get dressed or to find other items stored there.
