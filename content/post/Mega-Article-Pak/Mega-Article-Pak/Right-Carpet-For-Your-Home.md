Right Carpet For Your Home

If you walk into any carpeting store, you'll find
yourself amazed at all of the choices that are there
for you to pick from.  You'll find textured plush
carpets, saxony carpets, berber carpets, and even
commercial grade carpets.  There are carpets that
can be installed wall to wall, and carpets that can
be cut to size with bound edges and carpet squares.

Your first consideration when purchasing a new carpet
should not be color, even though it is important.  
Your first consideration should be how much traffic
you are going to have on the carpet.  If you plan
to put carpet in the bedroom, then it won't have as
much traffic as carpet in the living room.

Stain resistance will also be important.  This is
something to think about with any carpet, especially
carpet that is going to be used in a dining room
or play room area where there will be a stready
stream of food or possibilities for spills.

You'll also want to inquire about the rating of the
carpet as well.  Indoor carpeting is normally rated
on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest 
rating.  Carpets with a 5 rating are considered the
best for heavy traffic areas.  Rating of 4 are 
considered outstanding and recommended for heavy 
traffic areas of your home.

Ratings of 2.5 to 4 would provide normal durability
for your home.  Carpets that rate 2.5 or lower 
should only be used with light traffic areas, such
as bedrooms.  Choosing carpet based on the type of
traffic it will receive can help you save a lot
of money down the road, although you should buy
carpet suited to your needs and requirements.

The highest quality of carpet you can buy is carpet
made of wool.  Wool carpets are very expensive,
although you'll reap the benefits over years of
use as wool will easily out perform any man
made carpet.  Two of the best benefits of wool
carpet include its natural soil resistance and
it's ability to retain appearance, meaning it
won't crush or wear down like other carpets.

The downside to wool carpet, is the fact that it
is out of reach for most of us.  If you can't 
afford to have woold carpet installed throughout
your entire house, then you should instead have
it installed in the room that receives the highest
amount of traffic.

There are several different man made carpets that
you can choose from as well.  If you have a high
traffic area, then nylon would be an ideal choice
due to the durability.  Nylon is stain resistant
as well, and repels mildew.  

Carpets made of olefin is also a great choice for
high traffic areas as it is very strong and easy
to clean.  Polyester is another good carpet as 
it is easy to clean and repels water based stains.
Polyester is known for the look and feel of wool,
although it is much less expensive.

The color consideration is also important.  Light
colored carpets create an effect of a larger
space, although they do tend to show stains more
easily.  Dark carpets on the other hand tend to
absorb light, giving a room what many know as 
the "cozy feeling".  

When you find a carpet that appeals to you, you
should ask to take a piece of it home.  Look at
it during natural daylight and at night under
an artificial light to see if the color changes 
at all.
