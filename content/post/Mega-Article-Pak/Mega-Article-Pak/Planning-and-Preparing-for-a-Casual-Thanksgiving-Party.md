Planning and Preparing for a Casual Thanksgiving Party

Have you recently made the decision to throw a Thanksgiving party?  If so, have you decided which type of party you would like to host?  If you are looking to host a Thanksgiving party, without having to give up a large amount of your time or money, there is a good chance that you may be interested in hosting a causal Thanksgiving party. Although a causal Thanksgiving party can save you time and money, it is still advised that you start planning and preparing for your party early.  

When it comes to planning and preparing for a causal Thanksgiving party, there are a number of important tasks that you must complete. One of those tasks, perhaps, the most important one is inviting your guests. Your Thanksgiving party will not be a party if you don’t have any guests. That is why it is important that you extend an invite to whoever you wish to have at your party.  Since your Thanksgiving party will be casual in nature, you may prefer to give casual invites.  In addition to traditional party invitations, you may prefer calling your guests directly or sending them a quick email.

When inviting guests to your Thanksgiving party, it may be a good idea to ask them to either confirm or deny their reservations. Having an exact number of intended party guests, or at least an estimated number, will help make your party planning easier.  It will enable you to make sure that you have enough food or party favors to go around.  An estimated number of guests may also help you save, even more, money.  Of course, you will still want to be prepared for unexpected arrivals, just in case.  

As previously mentioned, having an accurate guest count will help make it easier for you to purchase food for your party. Since you will be having only a causal Thanksgiving party, you may not want to cook a large Thanksgiving dinner.  If that is the case, a small number of snacks and drinks may do.  Before your party is set to take place or you begin shopping for it, it may be a good idea to develop yourself a food and snack list.  You should list all of the foods or drinks that you would like to have at your party. Making a list will help to ensure that you get everything that you needed or wanted to have.  

It is also advised that you consider what forms of entertainment, if any, you plan on having at your causal Thanksgiving party. The thing about casual parties is that most guests arrive expecting to have a good time.  While this may put more pressure on you to plan an amazing, fun filled party, there are a number of advantages to this. One of those advantages is the fact that you have a wide variety of different entertainment forms to choose from. Popular entertainment, for casual parties, tends to include music, dancing, as well as party games. 

Even when attending a casual party, such as a casual Thanksgiving party, guests expect to arrive at a clean house.  For that reason, you will want to make sure that your home is as clean as it could possibly be.  You may want to leave vacuuming and other similar task to the last minute, but there are other cleaning tasks that you may want to take care of ahead of time.  One of those tasks may include cleaning up the outside of your home. You will want to make sure that entranceway to your home, both inside and out, is free of clutter or unwanted debris.  The first step in pleasing your party guests to welcome them into a clean and inviting home.  

Although it is much easier, in most cases, to plan a causal Thanksgiving party, it is still necessary to plan and prepare for your party ahead of time. By keeping the above mentioned planning and preparation tips in mind, your next Thanksgiving party should go off without a hitch.
