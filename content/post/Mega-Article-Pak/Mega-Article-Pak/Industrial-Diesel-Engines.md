Industrial Diesel Engines

Industrial diesel engines are any engines that are used
for industrial purposes that run on diesel.  Industrial
diesel engines are used to power a major portion of 
industrial machinery, from motorbikes to bulldozers, 
generators, and even forklifts and trucks.  They range
in size from a few pounds to a few tons, with a various
amount of power.  

The use of diesel engines is mandated by several large
organizations. All NATO machinery for example, runs on
either diesel or aviation grade kerosene.  At the 
current level of technology, fossil fuels, and especially
diesel are the most economical and convenient means
of supplying power to a variety of equipment and 
even backup generators.

All industrial diesel engines can be either air cooled
or water cooled.  The smallest engines for residential
purposes will typically provide about 10kW and cost
a few thousand USD.  These smaller scale engines power
much of the mobile machinery we see around us on a 
daily basis, such as trucks, farm equipment, small
boats, stationary process machinery, earth movers,
and so on. 

The medium scale industrial diesel engines can provide
levels between a few hundred kW and a few thousand
kW and are sold for prices in usually the thousands 
of dollars.  These types are used in larger machinery
such as larger mining equipment, oil rigs, trains,
large boats, military equipment, and much more.

The largest of industrial diesel engines provide 10,000
to 80,000 kW, sold in the millions of dollars, and
are used for ultra heavy equipment, electric power
generation, and the largest of ships.  Large industrial
engines can be up to 49 feet side and run on low
grade diesels.  In places such as China, where there 
is a high demand for de-centralized power sources,
these types of engines are often utilized.

Industral engines are classified in terms of their
speed, or RPM (Rotations Per Minute).  High RPM 
engines are normally used for the lighter, more common
applications, such as trucks and other types of land
equipment.

Medium RPM engines are generally used for power
generation.  Low RPM ranges, and high torque engines
are used for the biggest type of equipment, such as
marine equipment and applications.  

For the most part, industrial diesel engines can
vary in terms of size and performance.  Chances are,
you've either seen or used industrial equipment at
some point in time.  Although they cost a lot of
money, they are the way to go with bigger equipment
for getting the job done right the first time.
