Yoga for Women: Before you Start 

The following yoga poses can be done anytime, anywhere, or as part of another workout. Always warm up for a few minutes with some walking, marching or similar activity until your body and muscles feel loose and warm. 

Breathe deeply and fully while holding the poses, breathing from your lower belly and diaphragm rather than holding your breath in your chest. In yoga a breath cycle is one inhale and one exhale. 

Do the poses in a tranquil environment. Music, if used, should be tranquil and peaceful. Move to your own limits.
