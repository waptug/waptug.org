Upcoming Trip to Sotheby’s

I am planning a trip to an auction at Sotheby’s in June.  I have a real interest in 20th century British art and they have an art auction scheduled.  I have spent a great deal of time planning this trip.

While I was browsing the Sotheby’s online catalog, I found a signed Sickert named South Façade of St. Jacques.  I saw this painting once in London in 1971.  It has been in Canada since its purchase around that same time.

The painting is thought to be painted around 1900 after the artist had been in the town of Dieppe for two years.  He found a great deal of beauty in this medieval place.  He loved the architecture and it was the subject of a lot of his work.  Sotheby’s has several pieces of his work up for auction at this event.

I also noted in the catalog that Sotheby’s will be auctioning off a watercolor of a cat by the artist Gwen John.  She painted a lot of cats and also portraits of seated women.  She was known to paint the same picture over and over again like Monet did.

There was another lot listed in the Sotheby’s catalog that interested me.  I really am partial to Sickert and there was a painting that he completed in Venice while he was there with his wife.  There are stories of marital troubles between them and the trip to Venice is thought to have been taken to repair their marriage.

I can’t wait to see the painting Thunder in the Mountains by James Dickson Innes.  His watercolors are really splendid.  The painting is thought to have been painted in 1910 in the mountains of North Wales.  Sotheby’s has such an extensive catalogue for this auction.

I’m anxiously awaiting my trip to London.  I love Sotheby’s art auctions and going out to expensive restaurants at night.  I plan to go to the Mango Tree while I’m there.  It is the best Thai food, hands down, that I’ve ever eaten.

My business partner was really taken with the Landscape Near Lyons painted by Sir Matthew Smith.  I liked this oil painting as well.  The Sotheby’s catalogue reported that the painting was done in 1922 and that there is a still life of flowers on the reverse.  My partner will be unable to make this trip and has asked me to bid on it for him.

I have a small private collection of pencil drawings.  I liked the Flower in a Glass Vase that was penned by Christopher Wood in 1925.  I think that it would display nicely with other still lifes that I have.  I think that this pencil art may well go for twelve thousand dollars.  My favorite pencil drawings have all been found at Sotheby’s auctions

I have a patron that is very interested in a lot at the Sotheby’s auction that contains Poppies by Ivon Hithchens.  She has authorized me to bid up to sixty five thousand dollars for her.  I hope that I am successful in acquiring it for her.  I know that this Sotheby’s auction will be well attended because they all are.  It is too much to hope for that no one will notice this fantastic painting.

After looking forward to this trip for so long and poring over the Sotheby’s catalogue so intently, I must say that I have my heart set on Broomswade by John Piper.  I absolutely must have this watercolor.  The person that is selling it has been the only owner.  He bought it directly from John Piper in 1966.  If I win nothing else, I will win this painting.

The only other painting that I plan to bid on at the Sotheby’s auction is one by William Turnbull.  There is a collector that I know that desperately wants this painting.  He owns several of this artist sculptures and has now started to collect his paintings.
