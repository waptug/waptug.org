Are Air Travel Rules Different Between Airports

Are you a frequent flyer?  If so, there is a good chance that you know all of the air travel rules.  Do you?  If so, do you know that air travel rules can vary between airports?  Most travelers, especially those that tend to fly out of the same airports, are unaware that the rules are different.  

When understanding air travel, it is important to remember that there are two main sets of rules.  One set of rules are often imposed by the federal government.  These restrictions, such as the bans on sharp objects or certain liquids, must be upheld in all airports in the United States.  Despite these types of bans and air travel rules, you may also find that specific airports have implemented their own rules and restrictions. Although it is not required, a number of them have.  

Whether you are a first time flyer or a frequent flyer, who is flying out of a new airport, you are advised to famialrize yourself with the air travel rules that are implemented in all airports, as well as the ones that are implemented individually, by each airport.  The rules that can be found in each airport are just as important as the rules that are widespread. For this reason, it is important that you famialrize yourself with them. This can be done a number of different ways.

Perhaps, the best way to learn airport rules is by visiting the website of the airport in which you will be flying out of. If you do not already know the address of that website, you can easily find it out by performing a standard internet search. You should perform your search with the name of the airport in question.  Once at the website’s main page, you should be able to find information on air travel rules.  You are encouraged to fully read those rules and take note of what you see; it may come in useful later on.    

As nice as it is to get information online, you are advised to be careful with what you find.  Most airports update their online websites on a regular basis, but not all do.  You will want to be on the lookout for outdated information. In addition to outdated information, there is a good chance that you will not find anything at all.  If your airport’s online website does not have any information on air travel safety and rules, it does not necessarily mean these rules do not exist.  However, it does mean that you may have to obtain the information elsewhere, such as directly from the airport. 

When trying to contact an airport, you will have a number of different options.  If you are flying out of a local airport, it is likely that you can get the airport’s contact information for your local phone book. If not, you should be able to obtain it online.  Regardless of where you get your information from, you should find that each airport has a number of different telephone numbers listed.  In the event that there is not a phone number listed specifically for information on air travel rules, you will want to contact the customer service department.  Most airline representatives would be more than willing to answer all of your questions, including those on airport rules and restrictions.

In addition to familiarizing yourself with the airport that you will be flying in and out of, it is also a good idea to examine your airline.  Like many airports, many airlines have implemented their own air travel rules, guidelines, and restrictions.  For instance, there are some airlines that have specific rules on the flying with pets and others that are more flexible.  Before leaving for the airport, it is important that you determine whether or not these additional air travel rules exist.

When flying out of a new airport or on a new airline, the “but the other airline allowed it,” excuse will not work. That is why, to prevent confusion or confrontation, you are advised to know what rules and restrictions each airport and airline has, if any.
