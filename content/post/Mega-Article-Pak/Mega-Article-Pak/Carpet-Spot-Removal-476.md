Carpet Spot Removal

Anyone who has experience with carpet knows the types
of accidents that can happen.  Carpet is very common
with most houses these days, making the risk for
accidents and spills higher than ever.  No matter 
what the spill may be, mud, blood, or milk - there
are ways to clean everything.

At your local department store or grocery store, 
there are several products that you can pick up that
will work great.  The only problem with these products
is the fact that they are normally very vague with
how you should use them.

The first thing you should know is that if you 
have a red stain on your carpet, you shouldn't try
to get this out yourself, but instead leave it to
a pro.  There are certain procedures and very 
effective methods that your local carpet cleaning
company can do to save you from ruining your carpet.

Keep in mind that red is the toughest stain to get
out.  A professional carpet cleaner is the way to
go, as he is properly trained and equipped to 
handle them.

For everything else, there is always an effective
and cheap way to clean spots on both your carpet
and the upholstery.  If you are only buying the
products that work for you, then you aren't paying
much attention to the label or the technique in
getting the stains out.

The first thing to do is go to your local Auto 
Zone or auto parts store and pick up the auto
upholstery and carpet cleaner in the can.  Tuff
Stuff is one of the best you can get.  Almost
all cleaners that come in a can are foaming
cleaners, which will make your work a lot easier.

The foam in these canned cleaners will penetrate
the fibers upon contact and as it foams, it will
release and suspend the stains and soils.  You
may need to lightly scrub the areas with a 
towel or soft bristled brush.

To help you clean the spots, the tips below may
come in handy:
	1.  You should only use white rags or
towels when you clean carpet and upholstery to 
reduce the risk of ruining colors or color 
transfer.
	2.  You should use foaming cleaners to
clean your entire upholstery, even though it may
state to dry clean only.
	3.  You should always test your product
of choice first on a hidden area to save yourself
heartache and embarrassment in case things don't
turn out the way you hope.  
	4.  If you need the help of a professional,
you shouldn't hesitate to contact one.

As long as you don't have a red stain in the
carpet, you shouldn't have any problems getting 
it out.  Stains and spots are a carpet's worst
enemy, which is why you should always get them
out as soon as you can - to prevent things from
getting any worse.
