The Benefits of Owning an Automatic Pool Cleaner

In the United States, it is estimated that over millions of homes have a pool in their backyard.  In fact, so many homeowners have pools that there is a good chance that you have one in your own backyard.  If you do, how do you clean it?  Many pool owners, maybe even yourself included, clean their pools by hand, but did you know that there is a better way?  That way involves the use of an automatic pool cleaner.

There are literally an unlimited number of benefits to owning an automatic pool cleaner.  However, to understand those benefits, you must first learn about automatic pool cleaners and how they operate.  As with many other pool products, including pool accessories, you will find that automatic pool cleaners come in a wide variety of different makes and models.  Despite the different styles, all automatic pool cleaners accomplish the same goal. That goal is to keep your pool clean and free of debris.

When it comes to automatic pool cleaners, you will see that there are two main types of automatic cleaners. These cleaners are often referred to as a vacuum cleaner or a pressure cleaner. While both types of these automatic pool cleaners will help to keep your pool clean, they work in different ways.  Before making a decision as to which type of automatic pool cleaner you would like to purchase, you are advised to quickly familiarize yourself with each.

Automatic pressure cleaners often work in a way that is similar to a pressure washer. With these cleaners, high pressure water is used to stir, mix, and bring dirt and debris up from the bottom of the pool floor. Once this debris has been brought up to the surface of the water, it then can be removed through the pool’s filter.  

Automatic vacuum cleaners work in a way that is similar to a traditional vacuum cleaner. Special hoses create suction that is used to lift dirt and debris up from the bottom of the pool. These hoses may then be connected to the pool’s filtration system or a special bag can be used to collect the debris. The pool vacuums that tend to have their own filter bags are often known as robotic cleaning systems.  This is due to the fact that they can operate without the assistance of a pool’s filtration system.

Regardless of which type of automatic pool cleaner you purchase, you will like be pleased with the results.  This is because there are a number of benefits to using an automatic pool cleaner versus doing it yourself.  Just one of the many benefits includes the amount of time you will save.

If you are currently a pool owner and you manually clean your own pool, it is likely that you know that it can be a long and difficult process. In the amount of time that it may take you to manually clean your pool, there are probably a million other things that you can be doing. This means that you may be able to spend more time working, with your family, or better yet, you could spend more time swimming.  

In addition to saving yourself time, you may also be able to save yourself money by using an automatic pool cleaner. Many pool owners do not have enough time to manually clean their own pools. If you are one of those individuals then there is a chance that you may hire outside help. While having someone else clean your pool is a great way to avoid doing it yourself, the cost can quickly add up. For a reasonable price, an automatic pool cleaner can do the same job.  In fact, you may find that, overtime, an automatic pool cleaner ends up paying for itself.

Whether you are manually cleaning your own pool or hiring a professional, you are advised to at least consider purchasing an automatic pool cleaner.  After you take the time to examine the pool cleaners that are available for purchase, you may start wondering why you waited so long to get one.
