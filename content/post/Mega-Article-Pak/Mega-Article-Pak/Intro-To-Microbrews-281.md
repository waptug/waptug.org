Intro To Microbrews

With their varying flavor intensities and alcohol
contents, microbrews are here because beer 
distributors noticed a market demand and took a 
gamble on imports like Corona in the 70s.  This
type of flavorful beer sold to a limited yet very
enthusiastic crowd.

Beer manufacturers create what sells, therefore
they didn't believe there would be a significant 
maket with those types of beers.  Consumer studies
and sales showed that the biggest part of the
American audiences enjoyed watery brew.

Then, out of nowhere, microbrews popped up after 
the first successful brew, Samuel Adams, fought 
with import distributors to try and convince them
that a flavorful American beer would sell.  Now,
we have more microbrews than ever before with more
coming out each and every day.

Microbrews really hit when distributors really 
believed that at least some people would buy them.
On the other hand, home brewers and brewpubs had
legal wars.  In 1968, home brewing was legalized 
and home brewers now had the support and assistance
of supply and advice stores.

Until 1983, brewpubs were illegal in all states.  
Late in 1983, California first began to allow
brewpubs to brew and distribute their brands of
beer on site.  These charming, yet small batch
breweries experienced high sales, especially in
restaurants.

Around a century ago, the United States had more 
than 2,000 breweries making many different styles
and variations.  By the 80's, there were only 40
brewing companies that offered a brand of American
Pilsner.  

Today, there are over 500 microbreweries and brewpubs
in the United States.  Over the past few years, 
brewpubs have been popping up all over th e place, 
even in bars that used to only carry the top beers.
