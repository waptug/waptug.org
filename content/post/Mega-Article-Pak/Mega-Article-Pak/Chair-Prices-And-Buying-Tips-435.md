Cheap Prices and Buying Tips

Being in the office business, you should expect to
pay around 250 - 350 for a good office chair.  Even
though top of the line office chairs can cost 
thousands of dollars, they usually aren't more
comfortable than a 300 dollar chair.  Instead of
paying thousands for the chair, you're normally 
paying thousands for the brand name instead.

For those on a budget who don't want to spend a 
lot of money on office chairs, less expensive chairs
are available for around 100 dollars per model.  
Global and Wallace are among the best in low 
budget office chairs.

Ask about repairs
Whenever repairs are required for your ofice chairs,
you should ask if parts can be replaced.  If the
parts have to be shipped to your office, you should
find out who is responsible for shipping charges, 
as they can tend be quite expensive.  If shipping
isn't required, you should find out about delivery.

Discounts
Discounting is very rampant in the channel of 
dealers.  Even if you are only buying one office 
chair, you can still get up to a 30 percent discount
off the suggested price of retail.  As you buy 
more and more office chairs, the discount will keep
getting bigger and bigger.  

Therefore, it's always a smart decision to buy your
office chairs in bulk.  If you have a lot of employees, 
you'll save hundreds and maybe even thousands of 
dollars.  Saving money is something everyone likes to
do, especially when it comes to your office.

Trials
If you plan to buy a lot of chairs at a time, you 
should ask for a few trial chairs to be brought to 
your office.  Then, you can let your employees vote
for the chairs they like best.  Even though a standard
chair will be sufficient for most people, it may be
necessary to purchase other chairs as well.

For example, taller people will need special chairs,
as well as those with a lot of weight.  No one chair
will work for everyone, as the human body comes in 
different shapes and sizes.  

Making your decision
You can purchase your chairs either locally, or online
if you prefer.  Even though they may be cheaper 
online, you still have to worry about shipping 
charges.  Buying locally is the best way, especially 
if you are buying many different office chairs.

Those planning on getting the most from their office
and employees, should look into the most comfortable
office chairs for the money.  Your employees will feel
and work much better with comfortable chairs, which 
is reason enough to make the investment and go that
extra mile.
