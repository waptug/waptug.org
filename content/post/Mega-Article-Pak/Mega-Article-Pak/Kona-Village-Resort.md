Kona Village Resort

The amazing and relaxing Kona Village Resort is 
located on the western coast of the Big Island of
Hawaii.  Offering you breathtaking views and plenty
of things to do, the Kona Village Resort is a 
beach vacation come true.

If you are planning to relax, unwind from the 
pressures of life, and get closer to nature, Kona
Village Resort is the ideal place to go.  This 
vacation resort caters to couples seeking romance
as well as families looking to spend quality vacation
time together.  

The Polynesian style cottages have no phones or 
television sets.  This way, guests can spend their
days trying out new activities, exploring the rich
Hawaiian marine life in the bay, or just spend time
relaxing time on the beach.

The resort offers 125 individual bungalows that
are spread out across 82 tropical acres.  They are
all different in style, size, and view.  The south
side of the resort offers palm trees and tropical
foliage, while the lagoon side features wildlife,
and the north side features a unique lava flow.

When it comes to dinner, you'll have a choice of
two oceanfront restaurants.  The cuisine is light
with an emphasis on fresh island vegetables and
fish.  On Friday, the resort hosts the infamous
and legendary Lu'au, which has been a Hawaiian 
tradition for many years.

The Kona Village Resort is located on 82 acres
of tropical heaven with a large beach - private 
for guests.  You can explore the resort bay
that is teeming with wildlife, including the
Hawaiian grean sea turtles and blue tangs.

If you visit the resort between December and April,
you may even catch the North Pacific humpback
whales as they migrate from Alaska to Hawaii - 
right off the beach.  Almost every night at the
resort, you can see the manta rays swim into the
light in front of the Hale Moana restaurant.

There are several different activities to choose
from here as well, including snorkeling, kayaking,
and sailing.  The Kona Village resort will even
organize daily volleyball games and glass bottom
boat tours.  If you choose, you can even play
tennis, go fishing, or even scuba diving - in
the crystal clear Hawaii water.

The Kona Village Resort in Hawaii is another fine
example of everything Hawaii has to offer you on
your beach vacation.  Hawaii is a beach vacation
paradise, with something for the entire family.
If you've been looking for the ideal vacation spot,
Kona Village is where you'll want to spend almost
all of your time.
