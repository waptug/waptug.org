Selecting Your Golden Puppy 

Once you have decided on a breeder that you can trust, you’ll need to start thinking about what type of puppy you want.  This decision could take you some time, as it can be quite a few weeks or even months before the right litter is whelped - although it will be worth the wait.  If your breeder has a few litters available when you look for your Golden puppy, you may be able to compare.

Some breeders may require that you put a deposit down on the puppy of your choice, if the puppies aren’t a certain number of weeks old.  The good litters rarely go unsold, as most are already spoken for before the puppies are seven weeks old.  If you want to get in on a good litter, your best bet is to get to your breeder early - before all of the puppies are sold.

When you arrive to get your puppy, you shouldn’t be alarmed if the breeder does the selecting for you.  Most quality breeders will spend quite a bit of time with the puppies and they will know just what their individual temperaments are.  The better breeders however, will do temperament tests to determine the temperament of the puppies they have with each and every litter.

By performing these tests, the breeder will get assistance in selecting which puppy goes to which type of home.  If you’ve chosen one of the better breeders, you should let him do his work and help you select the puppy that he or she thinks will be your best match.  Breeders can obviously select you a better puppy, as they have been around the litter for several weeks - and you have only been around the litter looking at them for a few minutes.

Although all Golden puppies are appealing to the eyes, you need to base your reasons on more than looks.  Before you pick your puppy up, you should always make sure that he has a strong build, with straight legs.  The puppy should be strong and muscular, yet be squirmy and active when you first try to pick him up.  You should also make sure that he has healthy teeth and gums, and look over the rest of his body to make sure that he is healthy.

If your breeder does allow you to select your puppy from the litter, then you should take the puppies that you are considering to get away from the remainder of the litter and observe each one carefully, and how they react to you.  Puppies that are around 7 weeks of age should be apt to explore their surroundings.  Even though they may be a little cautious at first, the puppies should still be more than anxious to look around and sniff their surroundings.

When you single out the puppies, make sure you speak to the ones you are interested in and see how they react to your voice.  Try moving around and playing with them, and see how they respond to you.  Some puppies will be faster than others, although you shouldn’t pursue any interest in a puppy that doesn’t show any interest in moving objects or their surroundings.

If you take your time and evaluate each puppy that you are interested in, you can find the best puppy for you and your family.  Golden Retriever puppies are great to have, providing you get one that’s healthy.  Getting a healthy puppy should be your desire - as a healthy puppy will grow into a strong and healthy adult - and be around for years to come.
