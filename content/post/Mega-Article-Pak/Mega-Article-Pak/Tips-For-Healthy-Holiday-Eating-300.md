Tips For Healthy Holiday Eating

When the holidays arrive, many people forget all
about their diets and healthy eating.  Weight 
gains of 7 - 10 pounds are common between 
Halloween and Christmas.  To make the holidays
easier, these tips will help you with healthy
eating through the season and not gaining weight.

Most traditional foods can be made low fat.  
Turkey is very lean without the skin, and gravy
can be made without any fat.  Potatoes that are
served without butter can be very healthy.  The
beloved pumpkin pie is nutritious, although it 
can be made into a fatty dessert with the adding
of whipped cream.

Even though the holidays are in, don't forget 
about the exercise.  Keeping weight off during
the holiday season is burning off the extra 
calories.  You should plan a walk after meals, 
park farther from stores when you shop, and 
take a few walks around the mall before you 
begin shopping.

During holiday parties and at family dinners, 
feel free to sample foods although you shouldn't
splurge.  Decide on what you plan to eat in 
advance, then stick to your plan.  Eat plenty
of vegetables, fruit, low fat dressings, and
slices of lean meats.  Before you go to a party, 
eat a small snack to help curb your appetite.

If at all possible, avoid alcohol.  Having too
many drinks can cripple your will power, and 
also add excess calories to your diet.  In the 
place of alcohol, drink water with lemon. Water
can help to limit your appetite and keep you 
from binging.  Also make sure to avoid eggnog, 
as each glass can have up to 300 calories.

Be flexible with your healthy eating, as one bad
meal won't ruin your diet.  Try to balance your
calories over a few days and don't just look at
one meal or day.
