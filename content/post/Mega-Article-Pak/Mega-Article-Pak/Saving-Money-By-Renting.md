Saving Money by Renting

For many renters the possibility of using a rental situation to save money is a foreign idea. These renters often bemoan the fact that they have to rent a property rather than purchase a property because they feel as though not owning the property is basically throwing money away each month. However, this is not entirely true. While there are certainly benefits to homeownership and building equity homeowners can also benefit financially by renting an apartment rather than purchasing a home. 

While it is certainly true that money spent each month on rent does not get the renter any closer to homeownership while each monthly mortgage payment makes the homeowner one step closer to owning the property completely. However, this is not the whole story. Renters should also consider the amount of money they will be able to save annually for the purpose of purchasing a home by living in a rental property right now. 

A Smaller Apartment Can Lead to a Bigger House

Some would be homeowners find renting a small apartment can allow them to start saving for the purpose of purchasing a house in the future. Renters who are willing to sacrifice comfort now and stay in the smallest apartment possible will likely be able to save the most money towards purchasing a home. 

In general the monthly rent for an apartment is based on a value per square foot. This value may vary slightly from one property to the next but is likely to be very similar in properties in the same general area. This means apartments which are smaller in terms of square footage are likely to be less expensive overall. Therefore renters who would normally feel more comfortable and able to spread out might opt for a smaller apartment just so they can begin saving more money for their home purchase. 

Budget Wisely to Save Money 

Renters who want to save money for the purchase of a home while renting an apartment should understand their monthly rent is not the only factor which may prevent them from saving money while they rent. For example entertainment costs should carefully be considered when a renter is trying to save money. Most rental properties have a fully equipped kitchen making it ideal for the renter to prepare meals at home as opposed to going out to eat. Renters who cut down on eating dinner out may find they are able to save quite a bit of money each year.

Likewise renters who are spending an excess amount of money on superfluous items may have difficulty saving for a house while renting an apartment. Examining all current monthly expenditures can help the renter to determine where there is the potential for financial savings. Making changes such as debt consolidation may be one way to decrease monthly bills but this is certainly not the only solution. Renters can make other changes such as canceling subscriptions to premium movie channels, minimizing cell phone plans to include only the amount of minutes used each month and making changes to insurance plans to result in an overall savings. Changes to insurance plans may include having your car and renter’s insurance covered by the same carrier. Many carriers offer discounted services to renters who are willing to bundle their services. All of these slight changes can help to enable a renter to save money for a home purchase in the future.
