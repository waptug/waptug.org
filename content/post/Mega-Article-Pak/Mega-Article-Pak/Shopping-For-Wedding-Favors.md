Shopping for Wedding Favors

Many couples have a great deal of trouble when shopping for wedding favors because they try to get the favors purchased in only one day or they wait for the last minute to start shopping for wedding favors and realize it is too late to order some of the items they are considering or wind up spending too much per favor because they are in a hurry and do not have time to comparison shop. This can be extremely frustrating but unfortunately it happens to a lot of couples who are trying to plan their wedding. However, if couples make shopping for wedding favors a priority during the wedding planning they may find the whole experience is a lot more enjoyable. This article will offer a few tips on the subject of shopping for wedding favors to help couples make the most of their wedding favor budget.

One of the most important things to remember when shopping for wedding favors is that you should plan on setting a budget for wedding favors while you are setting the budgets for the other aspects of your wedding such as location, food, entertainment and transportation. This is very important because many couples who neglect to do this are often surprised by the cost of wedding favors. They mistakenly assume they can lump wedding favors into an incidental budget but soon realize the cost of wedding favors can really add up. This is because you typically purchase a wedding favor for each guest at your wedding. Each favor may only cost a few dollars but you have to multiply this amount by the number of guests at your wedding reception. As an example consider wedding favors which cost $2 per favor. If you plan on having 300 guests at your wedding the cost of the favors will be $600. As you can see this is certainly not an incidental amount.

Another thing to remember when shopping for wedding favors is that it is a good idea to purchase your wedding favors at least a few weeks before your wedding day. This is especially important if you want to have the favors or ribbons used to wrap the favors personalized with your names and the date of your wedding.  This personalization often requires a couple of weeks lead time because your order has to be made especially for you instead of simply being shipped from a warehouse. Most companies will rush your order upon your request but there will typically be substantial fees involved with this service. 

Another reason to shop for your wedding favors at least a few weeks before your wedding date is you will most likely have to wrap the favors once they arrive. You may be able to have the distributor wrap the gift but again this will most likely involve an additional. The fee for wrapping the favors may be charged per favor and can add up pretty quickly especially if you are having the order rushed. If you will be wrapping the favors yourself you will want to allow yourself enough time to do so without feeling rushed. It is important to remember that you will have a lot of last minute details to attend to so you most likely do not want to have to worry about wrapping wedding favors at the last minute. 

One final thing to remember when shopping for wedding favors is that you should calculate all of the costs associated with the favor before deciding whether or not it will fit into your budget. There may be a base price for the item but there may be additional charges for personalization and costs associated with wrapping the favors. Even if you are wrapping the favors yourself you will still have the cost of wrapping paper, tape, ribbons and any other accessories you use to adorn the favors. It is a good idea to have the distributor supply you with a total cost for the favors including personalization and shipping before making your purchase. This will help to avoid misunderstandings about how much the favors will cost.
