E-Commerce And Affiliate Marketing

The creation of the internet and the mass production
of computers in the late 80's changed everyone's
lives forever.  Now, everyone has the potential to
be their own boss whether you are a stay home mom
or a manual laborer.  

All you need to do is search on Google for business
opportunities and it will bring up more than you
could ever imagine.  Even though you may think it's
easy to make a living on the internet, it actually
requires a firm business plan and a lot of hard
work.

You can run an online business with your current
job, and your potential market is a lot bigger than
the average stores.  

The first thing you'll need to decide is the type 
of business that's right for you, then research
the market.  The possible business choices open to
you are:
	1.  Affiliate programs
	2.  Adsense programs
	3.  Selling products

Affiliate programs will pay you a commission for 
selling company products.  You'll have no contact
with the customer, as all you do is provide sales
leads to the company of whom you have to be an
affiliate for.  

Adsense programs are where you take an existing
website you own of a particular subject then add
contexual adverts from Google's adsense program.
When someone clicks on an advert you'll receive a
few cents.  

The final method is selling products.  You'll build
a website with a shopping cart then give as many 
details as possible about the products.  When
customers buy products, you'll receive pay based
on what you sell and how many.

When it all comes down to it, you'll need to set
up a business and web site to get the most from
E-Commerce or affiliate marketing.  It'll take a
lot of hard work and dedication - although it'll
prove to be well worth it.
