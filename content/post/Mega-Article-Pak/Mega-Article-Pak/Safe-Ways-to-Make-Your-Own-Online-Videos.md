Safe Ways to Make Your Own Online Videos

In the recent years, the popularity of online video websites has skyrocketed.  Online video websites are websites that not only allow internet users to watch the videos that are hosted on their site, but many also give internet users the opportunity to create their own videos.  If you are interested in making your online video, like a large number of individuals are, there are some important factors that you should keep in mind.  One of those factors is your safety.

What is nice about online video websites is that you can create just about any video you want.  A number of popular video websites have rules and restrictions on the content that is allowed; however, it is understandable.  These restrictions often prohibit videos with threats and pornographic materials. Even with these restrictions in place, there are still a wide variety of different videos that you can make, but you are still advised to be cautious when doing so.

As previously mentioned, most video sites allow you make and share a video on just about whatever you want.  Online, you will find videos that promote particular products, videos that are considered unscripted taping, how-to videos, and personal videos.  When it comes to personal videos, internet users tend to include information about themselves or a funny story. Although this may make for an interesting video, for safety reasons, you need to be concerned with what you are recording and posting.

Video websites are video by millions of internet users, often on a daily basis. This means that there is a good chance that people that you do not even know will be able to find your video and watch it. Since you do not know who will be watching your video, you have no idea what they are like or what their mental status is. You should treat your online videos as if you would when talking to a stranger; you need to be careful with how much information you provide.

If you are making a homemade video, with a personal touch, there is a good chance that you will be the one in front of your camera.  In most cases, it is safe to show your own face.  Millions of internet video makers have done so, but it is a different story to include your personal information.  In the event that you want to introduce yourself, you are advised only to use your first name.  You may even want to think about creating another name to use just for your video, sort of like a pen name.  Depending on who watches your online video, it could be risky to put a name to your face.

In addition to your full name, you never should give your address out. That also includes your city or your state. With motive and means, someone who watches your online video could easily obtain your full address just by knowing the city or the state in which you live in.  The same should be said for your phone number. With a legitimate phone number, someone could easily get your address online. Essentially, if there is something that you do not want a stranger to known about you, do not put it in your online video.

Even though you should not include your personal information in one of your online videos, there are a still a number of individuals who do. These individuals do this for different reasons, but many are looking for online friends or someone to date.  You are advised against using online video websites, such as Google Video or YouTube, for those purposes.  If you are looking to find a new friend or a partner, you are advised to rely on online dating websites. Many of those websites have special security measures in place that are designed to keep you safe.  Online video websites do not.  

By keeping the above mentioned points in mind, you should be able to use online video websites without any problem. As long as you are cautious about the videos you post, the experience should be a pleasurable one.
