Choose a User Friendly Auto Navigation System

With so many options on the market when it comes to auto navigation systems how do you choose the one that will best suit your needs? This question may seem very simplistic; unfortunately the answer is not nearly as simple as the question. There are many things to consider when selecting a personal navigation system not the least of which is what purpose you will be using the system to achieve. 

Many people consider auto navigation systems for their automobiles and no other purpose. The truth is that these devices can have many very practical uses in your every day life. If you are a person who spends a lot of time outdoors, you might find that a handheld GPS device with mapping capabilities is better suited to your personality and your needs than a stand-alone type of auto navigation system. The reason being that these devices can not only be used for turn-by-turn driving directions but also for off road travels, geocaching, boating, hiking, biking, and mountain climbing among many other popular activities. Handheld devices are perfect because they can be easily removed from your vehicle and taken along with you. The portability makes them perfect companions for just about any activity in which you choose to participate.

Many newer models of cars, trucks, and SUVs are coming equipped with in dash auto navigation systems. Don't for a second think you aren't paying for these glorious goodies. In fact, the chances are that you are paying quite the premium price for these lovely features and aren't even aware. The worst thing though is that if you are financing the cost of your car you are also financing the cost of your navigation system. If at all possible avoid getting into this situation unless you are particular enamored of the look of the in dash systems as they really offer no better coverage than you can find in many stand alone systems that you can easily install and cost significantly less. The thing to remember about these systems is that they are only good as long as you are in your car for the most part. You may find some that can last so many hours away from a power source (if you have a system that you've installed yourself rather than a factory installed system) but most of them aren't going to offer the greatest features for activities such as geocaching or fishing.

Before you buy, seriously consider and have in mind the activities for which you will use your device. Don't buy a device that charges for features that you aren't likely to use and avoid at all cost an interface that isn't easy to use. Remember you will be using this while on the road most of the time and you want a system that won't require a concentrated effort in order to operate. We have quite enough distractions to deal with while on the road without adding a difficult to operate auto navigation system.

Auto navigation systems are great to have when you need them and even at times when they simply come in handy though you could have survived without them. For me the security of knowing that I will never be truly lost again is well worth the investment I have made in mine, I honestly believe you will feel the same way about your system once you decide which one is best for you.
