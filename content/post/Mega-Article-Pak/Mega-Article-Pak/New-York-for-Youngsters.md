New York for Youngsters

If you're vacationing in New York City with children you may find that doing all outdoor activities can be quite tiresome for all involved but going through museum after museum might not do the trick for all of your children. Children enjoy doing hands on activities that all museums simply don't readily allow for. This is where planning creative outlets for your children during your vacation can have a wonderful impact on everyone's enjoyment of the time spent in New York.

In addition you may discover a talent your child has that you'd have never known about otherwise. Some of the most interesting crafting types of opportunities in New York City will be mentioned here. I'm sure there are more that won't make the list but there are only so many hours in any given day. 

The first store to make my list is based upon a creative outlet that has shown a rapid rise in popularity over the last few years, painting your own pottery. The name of the store is The Painted Pot and you are allowed to select and paint your own pottery. You can even take pottery wheel classes with your little one if you are brave enough but it is quite likely that you will have a wonderful time and be able to bring your artwork home with you upon your return for vacation. Remember that there is firing time involved so do this early during the week if it's going to be on your list of things to do. Otherwise you'll need to arrange shipping to have your child's creations sent home to you.

For those of you who have promising musicians, how about a day at Triple Z Music Recording Workshops? This is a rather costly excursion but your child will gain actual studio experience and bring home a CD of their music at the end of the day. Kids will learn about life on both sides of the booth and this is a great idea for older children who have indicated a sincere interest in music. 

If you'd like to really impress your youngsters take them to the Cloisters, which is a branch of the Metropolitan Museum that centers on the art and architecture of medieval Europe. Your kids will feel as though they've stepped into a fairy tale. It is also a good idea to check out the works of art at the Met as well as this is one of the more kid friendly museums that wasn't designed specifically for children. 

You should also be aware of stores like Toys R Us in Times Square and FAO Schwarz, which each have unique offerings designed to enchant and entertain children. You'll have a ball watching your children have fun in these neat stores and you may find yourself having fun right along with them. Just make sure no one is watching of course. There are many other stores that have something to offer children of all ages, be sure to check it out and see which stores you find appealing and which stores your children might find fascinating.

Keep in mind that New York City has many wonderful parks that present excellent opportunities for your youngsters to get out, about, and run off some pent up energy. I think it's very important that you schedule some serious park time for your children while you're visiting New York in order to keep you all sane through the times that they are not fully entertained and prone to wondering minds.

It is also important when traveling with very small children that you schedule some sort of quiet time for them during the day. Children are so prone to sensory overload if they aren't provided with some sort of quiet place in which to unwind for a bit. Mid afternoon is a great time to go back to your room, freshen up, allow the little kids a bit of a break and the parents and older kids a little break from the noise and the crowds as well. Everyone will be much happier if your remember to schedule this vitally important rest time when planning your day.
