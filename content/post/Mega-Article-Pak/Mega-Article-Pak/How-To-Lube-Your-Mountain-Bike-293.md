How To Lube Your Mountain Bike

A mountain bike is a lot of fun although it does
require some maintenance.  You should always lube
your bike 15 hours or so before riding, as quick
jobs right before you take off normally doesn't
get everything lubed.  Some lube jobs will last 
for more rides, although if things get loud or 
shifting gets sticky, it's time to lube.

Here is how to lube your bike:

1.  The chain
Apply a generous amount of mountain bike lube to 
your chain as you move the pedals around backwards.
It also helps to find a spot to steady your hand
such as the frame while you move the pedals around
and around.  Make sure you watch out for the cranks
and chain rings as they move around.

2.  Front Deraileur
On the front defaileur, lube the pivots.  Use a 
spot of lube everywhere you can see movement when
you move the shift lever.

3.  Rear deraileur
Just like the front deraileur, lube the pivots.  

4.  Pedals
There are some types of clipless pedals that will 
need to have the release mechanism lubed.  You 
should only lube this mechanism if you have this 
type of pedal.

5.  Everything into motion
Pedal around, shift your gears, and bounce your 
bike around.  If you hear anything squeak, there's
a moving part there are it should be lubed 
immediately.

6.  Wipe it all clean
Once you've lubed everything and wiped it all 
around, simply wipe it all back off.  Use a rag
to wipe away all the lube you used, including all
the lube off the chain.  Wiping it away will leave 
the lube in between the parts but clean it away 
from everywhere it isn't needed.  This will keep 
your bike from collecting dirt while you ride.
