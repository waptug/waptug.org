Sony BRC-H700

The Sony BRC-H700 high definition video camera is
designed for a variety of remote acquisition 
applications, especially in television production
for recording programs and for use as a weather
or even traffic camera.

The PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera can display images
onto a large screen in auditoriums, teaching
hospitals, sporting events, trade shows, and even
concerts.  This unit is also ideal for distance
learning applications in which clear high definition
images need to be projected onto electronic white
boards during a presentation or other function.

The Sony BRC-H700 also features three 1/3 inch HD
CCDs with 1.07 megapixels, delivers accurate color
reproduction, and is ideal for taking pictures or
videos in low light environments.

The BRC-H700 has a wide pan range of 340 degrees
and a tilt range of 120 degrees.  Both the pan
and tilt speeds are variable within the range of
.25 to 60 degrees a second, so the camera can
capture both fast and slow moving objects with
minimal rocking vibration.  The camera also 
includes a 12X optical auto focus zooming lens,
which allows for a zoom capability of up to 48X
when used in combination with the 4X digital
zoom.

You can also control the BRC-H700 by external
devices which include the optional RM-BR300 
remote control via Sony's VISCA protocol.  Local
controls such as PTZ settings and any of the 16
presets can easily be accessed.  

The BRC-H700 has a card slot that accepts a 
variety of optional interface cards, including
the HD-SDI, SD/SD, i.Link, and even connections
for use with computers.

Other features include an image flip function 
for installation flexibility on ceilings or other
flat surfaces and up to 16 presets for operational
ease of use.
