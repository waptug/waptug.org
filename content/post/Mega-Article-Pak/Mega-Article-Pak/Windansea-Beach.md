Windansea Beach

Past all of La Jolla's ritzy homes, hotels, and well
known restaurants, lies Windansea Beach.  Down the 
hill, this beach is flanked by surfers and sunbathers
on hot summer days.  With sandstone cliffs, a sandy
beach, and amazing surf breaks, Windansea Beach has
been a popular surfing haunt as far back as the 1940s
and a gathering spot of the Windansea Surf Club since
the 1960s.

The shack on the beach that was built by surfers during
World War 2 is now a San Diego Historic site.  The
beach is also great for body surfing and snorkeling.
The north end of Windansea is fairly rocky, with the 
south being sandier, great for walking along the edge
of the water.  You can also enjoy a picnic in the
grass next to the beach and bask in the splendid views
of the Pacific Ocean.

At Windansea Beach, there are no restrooms.  During
the summer months, lifeguards are stationed all along
the beach, even in some weekends of fall and spring.
There are separate swim and surf zones at the beach,
with no wheelchair access.  When you visit, you can
park on the street or try the tiny single lot near
the beach.

Getting to the beach
You can find Windansea around 6800 Neptune Place.
From the north, follow I-5 south to the Genesee
Avenue exit then head west.  Turn left on Torrey Pines
Road and follow the road into downtown La Jolla.  
Turn left on Girad Avenue then take a right on Pearl
Street.  Take a left onto La Jolla Boulevard then
make the right on Nautilus Street and your there.

From the south, follow I-5 north to the Ardath Road
exit, Ardath Road will become Torrey Pines Road.  Take
a left from Torrey Pines Road onto Girad Avenue.  
Make a right onto Pearl Street then take a left onto
La Jolla Boulevard.  Take the next right on Nautilus
Street and your there.

Windansea is possibly one of the most beautiful 
beaches in Southern California - and a great place 
for romantic strolls at sunset.  Parents should
use caution with small children at the beach, as the
surf often breaks directly onto the shore with a 
lot of intimidating power.  

If you plan to visit the Windansea Beach, you should
make sure you get there early.  As with most beaches
in San Diego, getting there early will help you 
get the best parking and more privacy when the crowds
start to arrive.  Windansea is a very amazing beach,
and worth your time on hot summer days.
