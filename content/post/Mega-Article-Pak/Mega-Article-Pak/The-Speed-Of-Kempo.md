The Speed Of Kempo

Throughout the world of martial arts, the style known as Kempo is one of the best. Kempo uses extremely fast strikes, which is the area it is most known for.  Kempo has been around for many years, originating from Japan.  It was tested on the ancient battlegrounds, using punches, kicks, and very little grappling.  Kempo employs weapons as well, including disarming techniques against opponents who are using weapons.

What many don’t realize, is that Kempo is actually an older form of Karate.  To be more specific, Kempo mainly uses the forbidden techniques of sport karate and kickboxing to create a devastating means of self defense.  Throughout this deadly martial art, stylists will be taught that every block is a counter, and ever counter is a block.  Instead of simply blocking an attack, stylists will learn how to block in a way that executes a strike.

The most well known aspect of Kempo is speed.  If you’ve ever seen it in action by someone who has been studying for many years, the hand speed of the stylist is simply amazing.  Those that have been practicing for many years, including black belts, are able to execute techniques with blinding speed.  Often times, a Kempo stylist can land many strikes before you can even get the chance to counter - or block.

The hand speed in Kempo comes from something known as “speed striking”.  Although Kempo uses weapons and weapons training, it is more an unarmed martial art that teaches students how to defend themselves in any situation.  This style isn’t about just going around and hurting people though, as stylists learn a lot in terms of self control, and only to react when they are given no other option.

The speed striking in Kempo takes many years to master.  Students of the art will practice forms on a daily basis, which helps with the speed.  By practicing a certain movement over and over again, students will get faster and faster.  They will practice with other students, the instructors, and also with equipment such as punching bags.  Over time, students will get amazingly quick and able to execute strikes with amazing speed and precision.

Shadow boxing is also essential to developing speed with Kempo.  Students will spend quite a bit of time shadow boxing, learning their own movements.  As a result of shadow boxing, students will learn physical resistance as well as improve their levels of fitness.  This also helps with technique as well, as students will be engaging in practice with themselves.

The main exercise where speed striking will really come into play is with sparring.  When sparring, students will test their knowledge and skills against other students.  The instructors will pay close attention during this exercise, to see just how well the students are learning.  Sparring can be very fun to watch, especially when there are two black belts squaring off.  The more time a student spends sparring, the faster he will develop in the art of speed striking.

Throughout the years, Kempo has proved to be a martial art with very fast strikes.  It is one of the fastest striking martial arts in existence, although it teaches students self control and how to avoid confrontations.  Kempo is taught all around the world, making it an excellent martial art for children as well.  From adults to children, the martial art known as Kempo can teach self defense, harmony, self control, self confidence - and how students can help others in the world live a better life.
