Black's Beach

Black's Beach is a two mile long, sandy strip of
beach located at the base of the majestic cliffs
that can be up to 300 foot high.  Formally known
as Torrey Pines City Beach, it's jointly owned by
the City of San Diego and the State of California.
There is also a glider port atop the cliff that
overlooks the beach where hang gliders and even
remote control gliders can be seen soaring.

Gaining access to Black's Beach isn't easy due
to the high cliffs and lack of stairways.  The
safest access is from the adjacent beaches to the
north and south, although this way may be obstructed
by high tides or surf.

The cliffs here are unstable as well, and slides
can occur anytime, so it's always best to stay 
away from them.  There's no permanent lifeguard
station at this beach either.  There are some on
duty mid day from Spring Break through the end
of the October.

Keep in mind, most California beaches experience
very strong rip currents.  Black's Beach is no
exception, as the rip currents can get very strong
here.  To be on the safe side, always swim near
shore or near a lifeguard.

The water activity at Black's Beach is virtually
unregulated.  Surfers and swimmers may mix, but
they are all required to employ care and avoiding
hurting each other.  

Black's Beach is also an excellent beach for 
surfing, especially at the south end.  Scuba
diving isn't recommended here, due to access
problems and surf conditions.  

Even though access can be hard, Black's Beach is
still an excellent beach.  It offers plenty of
seclusion, views, and sand for the kids.  If you've
never been here, this beach can easily prove to
be one of your favorites in the entire area of
San Diego.
