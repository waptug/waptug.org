Make sure you have discussed everything thoroughly before they begin including how you want the closet area to look, the deadline for completing the project, if you will provide the tools or they need to bring their own, and the amount you will pay for the finished project. You can choose to pay by the hour or a flat rate for the entire project.

This makes installing and leveling much easier with an extra pair of hands in there. It is important to only use the right tools.

Before you begin putting the custom closet products together, take a few minutes to make sure all of the required parts to do so are there as well as the instruction manual. All of the necessary parts for the materials will be listed in the instruction manual.

If you are using a closet organizer kit, then make sure you follow the instructions for the proper order of installing the pieces. This is because some of them fit together in a particular way. If you purchased separate pieces of closet organizers, install them from the bottom up.

If this happens you will find yourself having to take some of the products out and reinstalling them. 

It is important that you adjust things as necessary. If you don’t have any studs to attach the closet organization products to, it is a good idea to add wall anchors and braces to give the products added support. For the best results, purchase quality items from your home improvement store. 

For the best results, take your time installing the custom closet accessories and products. Make sure each item is level before you secure it in place.
