Which Breed of Hypoallergenic Dog is Right for Your Family

If you are looking for a hypoallergenic dog, you will have many breeds to choose from. From smaller dogs like the Maltese, to larger breeds such as the Greyhound, these dogs tend to shed less, and do not product as much saliva or urine. When researching dog breeds, you should keep in mind not only whether they are hypoallergenic, but also which living conditions they prefer, how they behave around children, and how much care and maintenance they will need. Certain breeds require constant companionship, while other breeds can be left along all day while you are at work.

Smaller hypoallergenic breeds such as the Poodle, Maltese, Labradoodle, and Bishon Frise require much from their owners. Not only do they need companionship, they will also need to be bathed once a month and will also need to be brushed once a day in order to keep knots from developing in their fur. While these dogs have shorter hair and no undercoating, they may not be the best choice if you have small children. Territorial and moody, these dogs will get upset when they are competing with children for your attention. 

Small to medium dogs that are hypoallergenic and will behave around children include terriers, greyhounds, and the Mexican hairless. These dogs have short fur or none at all and do not shed as much dander as other breeds. If you live in a small apartment, these dogs are the better choice. They do not need a lot of room to run around in and they do not make too much noise. If you need to leave these dogs for the day while you are working or running errands, they will not be as nervous or scared as other breeds. 

Hypoallergenic dogs are usually the smaller breeds, even though greyhounds come in a variety of sizes. Deciding on the breed of dog will depend on your lifestyle and what you expect from a pet. If you already have a pet, you will want to buy a breed that will get along with other pets. 

Typically, hypoallergenic dogs will live ten to fifteen years. Many smaller breeds may experience health issues during this time, but for the most part, the dogs make great pets for those who do not have children or who do not have to travel for work. Because these dogs are small, they will usually not be able to reach couches, chairs, beds, or other furniture unless you help them up. This will also reduce allergens that can cause an allergy attack. 

Having your hypoallergenic dog groomed once every two months or so will not only keep the dog looking its best, but it will also help reduce the amount of allergens. Smaller dogs need to be bathed once a month in order to keep them clean. Over bathing will result in dry skin, so you should ask your veterinarian for instructions on how to bathe small dogs. Maintaining a clean coat and brushing your dog once a day will help reduce the allergens in your home.
