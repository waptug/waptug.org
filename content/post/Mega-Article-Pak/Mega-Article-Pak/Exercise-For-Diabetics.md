Exercise For Diabetics

The most common types of diabetes are known as Type
1 and Type 2.  The Type 1 diabetes, which is also
known as adolescent diabetes, differs from Type 2 
in the sense that the body will stop producing
insulin altogether.  Type 2 diabetes is normally
diagnosed in older adults and occurs as the body
stops producing enough insulin or the individual
becomes resistant to their own body insulin.

No matter what form of diabetes it is, you'll lose
your ability to adequately utilize sugar.  The 
blood sugar levels will increase due to the body's
difficulty in transporting sugar into the cells
and out of the blood stream.  There are several ways
to lower your blood sugar levels, including diet,
exercise, and medication.

As a whole, exercise is a very important part of
diabetic management for both Type 1 and Type 2
diabetics.  Those that have Type 1 will find regular
exercise helps to maintain insulin sensitivity, 
helps to prevent the accumulation of excess weight,
and also increases the use of glucose by muscles.
Although there is really no way to prevent Type 1
diabetes, it is possible to prevent Type 2 diabetes.

The things to consider when you attempt to prevent
the onset of Type 2 diabetes are regular exercise
supplementation with vitamins and herbs that will 
help to prevent insulin resistance and proper
control of weight.

Not only with exercise help directly with diabetic
management by lowering blood sugar levels and 
maintaining insulin sensitivity, but it will also
help minimize several of the complications that
can occur in a diabetic individual.  Research has
shown that walking 30 minutes each day can 
diminish the possibility of developing Type 2 
diabetes.

Almost all diabetics tend to develop circulatory
problems and exercise can help lower blood
pressure and improve circulation throughout the
body.  Seeing as how people with diabetes tend to
have poor blood flow to their lower areas and
feet, better circulation is a great benefit.

Even though there are risks associated with 
exercise, the potential benefits will outweigh
the risks.  Exercise does indeed lower blood sugar
levels, so those with diabetes should measure
their blood sugar both before and after they
exercise.  Since your body uses more sugar while
you exercise and makes you more sensitive to 
insulin, there is a risk of blood sugar becoming
too low and causing hypoglycemia as a result.

Whenever you exercise, it is important to let
others know that you are diabetic.  They should
also be informed about what they should do in
case of hypoglycemia.  To be on the safe side, you
should always carry candy or fruit juice with you
to treat low blood sugar when it occurs.

During and after you have exercised, you should
pay very close attention about how you feel, since
rapid heart beat, increased sweating, feeling
shaky, or hunger can signal that your blood sugar
levels are getting too low.

With diabetic management and treatment, exercise
is very important.  Exercise will help with blood
sugar control when the muscles use more glucose and
the body becomes more sensitive to insulin.  
Exercise will also help to prevent and minimize
common diabetic complications which include heart
problems, high blood pressure, and circulatory
deficiencies.  

If you are a diabetic, exercise should be part of
your daily routine.  You should always exercise at
a slow pace and never overdo it.  Also, you 
should be sure to exercise around people you know
or at a gym, so there will always be people around
you in case something goes wrong.  Being a diabetic
doesn't have to hinder your life or your 
performance, as exercise can help you get your life
back on track and heading in the right direction -
the healthy direction.
