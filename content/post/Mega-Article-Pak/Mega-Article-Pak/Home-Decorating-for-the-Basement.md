Home Decorating for the Basement

The basement is often a neglected point in many homes around the country. This space in many homes is more utilitarian than functional. The sad thing is that this space could be so much more for those who are interested in taking the time and paying the attention required to change the look from functional to fabulous. In many basements this will require a little more than minor home decorating skills while in other basements around the country all that is needed is a little color and a lot of style to make the basement the most in demand room in the house.

One common complaint that people have about basements is the fact that they are so dark and dreary. The reason for this is that most basements have little natural light that is allowed to flourish due to a serious lack of windows. However, this can also work to your benefit if you decide to use the basement as a media area. In fact, with the low ceiling and low light in the basement, this is probably the most perfect area in your home to turn into an excellent media room complete with surround sound and theater style seating. The only problem in this case will be getting the neighbors to quit begging to watch this week's newest DVD release at your house rather than their own. To pull this off you will want darker colored walls, floors, and ceiling in this room, a large screen television, comfortable seating and plenty of tables upon which you can place your beverages and popcorn.

Another great idea for basements is an artist or music studio. Basements can easily be portioned off into smaller rooms and all kinds of lighting can be installed in order to accommodate the lighting needs of many artists (keep in mind that one size does not fit all and artists that need natural light in order to work will not find most basements accommodating). By creating a smaller room, particularly for musicians, you are allowing yourself the additional option of soundproofing or at the very least dampening the room in order to save not only your ears but also the ears of the neighbors and animals that live nearby. These rooms can be simply furnished and decorated with music notes, a music stand, a comfortable place to sit, and the equipment needed to create music for musicians or an easel, art supplies, wash basin, comfortable seating, and perhaps a futon for relaxation for artists. 

If you are in need of a quiet place that is removed from the family in which to work (and who isn't really) the basement offers an ideal workspace for that provided you could get the lighting you need. Most people will need a professional to install the lights in a basement but most people will definitely need additional lighting in the basement in order to find the space tolerable for work. However, once the lighting situation is taken care of, the basement does make an excellent office space for many people. Try adding filing cabinets and photos, perhaps a fountain in order to make the area more serene and conducive to the work that needs to be done. Of course you will want comfortable seating and adequate desk or work table space as well. Design this room as you would any home office and it should do just well regardless of your home decorating talent.

One thing you need to keep in mind when it comes to home decorating and the basement is that many basements have a tendency to seep in high humidity or after heavy rains. Dehumidifiers assist with this problem but you may need to decorate with this in mind if the water and moisture is problematic. You will want to avoid mold and mildew at all cost, as they will ruin any potential enjoyment of your basement. Cork and ceramic tile are excellent flooring choices in this case and moisture barriers are an excellent idea to install before 'finishing' a basement.
