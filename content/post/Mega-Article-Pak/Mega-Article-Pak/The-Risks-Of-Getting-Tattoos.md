The Risks Of Getting Tattoos

Although most tattoos are applied with no problems at all, there are some tattoos that result in a not so good outcome.  No matter how safe you may think they are, you simply can’t overlook the risks involved with getting a tattoo.  Tattoo artists may tell you that there are no risks involved - although this isn’t the case.

The biggest concern you have when getting a tattoo is unsanitary equipment.  If the equipment isn’t cleaned and disinfected after each use, the risk for getting a disease is very high.  You can also end up with a serious skin disease as well, if the tattoo gun is dirty or if the tattoo artist doesn’t clean his equipment.  The tattoo studio should be clean as well.  With a lot of visitors, a studio can get dirty quickly - which is why it should be cleaned on a daily basis.

After getting your tattoo, if you notice any swelling or excessive redness around the tattoo, you should visit a doctor immediately, to find out if the tattoo is infected.  In most cases, tattoo infections can be treated with medicine.  If the infection is severe, you may be admitted to the hospital so they can further treat you.  In the more severe cases, you may end up having to get the tattoo removed to prevent further infection.  Removing a tattoo requires surgery, which also involves risks as well.

If removal of the tattoo is recommended or requested, the procedure can either be performed as an out patient surgery or one that requires a minimal stay in the hospital.  The surgeon or physician will determine the removal, based on your health and overall chances of developing an infection.  In most cases, tattoo removal is safe, with most patients given medicine that will treat infections and prevent any type of pain.

Although health risks are a concern, one of the biggest concern for may is the overall appearance of the tattoo.  Tattoos that are done by amateurs or not applied well, normally result in the appearance being ruined.  Tattoos are something that will stick with you for the rest of your life, which is why the appearance is so important.  If you get a tattoo removed, chances are that a scar will always remain.  Even though most scars will become less noticeable as years go by, they will never completely go away - and always provide a reminder that a tattoo was once there.

Before you get a tattoo, you should always make it a point to examine the studio and ensure that it’s clean.  You should also ask questions, and make sure that the tattoo artists clean the equipment they use.  If you stick around for a bit at the studio, you can normally find out a lot about the way they do business and how clean they are.  If the studio appears to be clean and tidy, chances are you won’t have to worry about dirty equipment or infections.

As with everything else in life, there are always decision to make.  If you are thinking about getting a tattoo, you should first decide your reason for getting it, how you will feel about having it later on in life, and if the tattoo is something you can see yourself with.  Before you put a permanent tattoo on your body, you should make sure that you are getting the tattoo for you because you want it.  Whatever you do, you should always avoid getting a tattoo simply because someone else suggested it.
