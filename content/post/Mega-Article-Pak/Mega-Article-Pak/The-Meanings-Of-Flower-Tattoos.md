The Meanings Of Flower Tattoos

These days, more and more women are getting tattoos.  As more women decide to get tattoos, flower designs continue to rise in popularity.  The best thing about flower tattoos is the fact that there are many different colors and types of flowers – providing many different meanings as well.  The flowers can mean a few different things, although specific types of flowers such as the rose and the Lilly may have a more specific meaning.

In general, flower tattoos have a connection with nature, bringing up thoughts and images of life and vitality. Anytime we look at a flower, we see the duration of life, simply flowers connect with us in the sense that we both grow.  Flowers emerge from the earth and continue to grow on a daily basis.  Then, the flowers bloom, knowing that they will later dry up and start to wilt away.

Having a tattoo with a flower brings back the entire process known as life.  Keep in mind however, that different colors and flowers on tattoos will symbolize other things as well.  White flower tattoos symbolize purity, while red flower tattoos can symbolize a burning passion.  There are many colors and designs available, giving plenty of meaning to those desiring flower tattoos.

Roses are the most common flower design for tattoos, symbolizing love.  During the turn of the 16th century, roses were tattooed on those who were sentenced to death.  If they were to escape from the gallows, the rose tattoo would serve as a symbol to easily recognize them.  These days, roses symbolize both love and passion.  Roses have long been known as a romantic flower, popular for special occasions with the ones we love.  

In the western regions, rose tattoos are a symbol of love and purity.  In the Eastern regions however, love and purity are symbolized by a lotus flower.  Tattoos that feature lotus flowers also bring a little more meaning to the table.  Lotus tattoos are also known to symbolize fortune, peace, beauty, and goodness.  Even though roses are the most popular tattoos in North America, Lotus flower tattoos are more common in other regions.

Other examples include the acacia flower tattoo which is the symbol for love and friendship.  There are some people with Irish heritage who choose to get tattoos with the flower known as the Bells of Ireland.  This flower is well known throughout Ireland, with the tattoo symbolizing good luck.  Irish who have this tattoo are known to be lucky, or have an insane trend with luck.

Those who think of themselves as being the perfect lover may want to get a tulip tattooed on their arm.  Tattoos with tulips represent passionate love and fame for being a great lover.  If you happen to be shy and timid, you may want to go with a violet flower tattoo instead.  Violets are common tattoos for those who are shy and timid, and enjoy taking things slow.  Those wanting to symbolize wisdom and virtue on the other hand, would be well to get an Iris.  Magnolias are also common with flower tattoos, as they symbolize an individual’s love for nature.

Flower tattoos are very common and popular designs these days, giving plenty of meaning behind their beauty.  The flowers can be large or small and as bold as you wish them to be.  No matter which flower you have decided to use with your tattoo, you can ensure that the flower says the meaning you are looking for.
