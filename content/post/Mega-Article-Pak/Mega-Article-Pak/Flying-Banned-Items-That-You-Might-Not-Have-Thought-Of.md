Flying?  Banned Items That You Might Not Have Thought Of

When you think of items that are banned on airplanes, what first comes to mind? If you were like most individuals you would say sharp objects.  Of course, sharp objects are banned on all airlines, but did you know that there is a long list of other items.  In fact, many of these items are items that you may have never given thought to before.  If you are gearing up to take a flight; it is advised that you give these items some though.

Before you learn more about the items prohibited, it is important that you know there is a difference between carryon luggage and checked luggage.  Carryon luggage is the luggage that you will be carrying and keeping with you at all times. Your checked baggage is the baggage that will be stored on the airplane, out of your reach.  When examining items that are prohibited aboard an airplane, it is important to remember that some items are not completely banned. While a large number of items may not be allowed in your carryon luggage, there are other some that will be allowed in your checked luggage.  

Recently, in 2006, a new ban was imposed; that ban is on liquids.  Due to recent security threats, a large number of liquids are now banned from being stored in your carryon luggage.  These liquids commonly include, beverages, liquid or gel based beauty supplies, and food with a liquid or gel based substance. Despite the new ban, there are a few exceptions.  Those exceptions include small doses of medication, small doses of eye drops or saline solution, and small amounts of baby formula.

In the event that you are vacationing to play sports, such as golf, you will need to check your golf clubs and other sports equipment, no matter how much you want to keep them by your side.  Prohibited sports items, which cannot be used as carryon luggage, include bows, arrows, bats, golf clubs, ski poles, pool cues, hockey sticks, and lacrosse sticks.  If your sports equipment is expensive, you will want to make sure that it is probably packed, to prevent damage.

The majority of tools are also banned from being included as carryon luggage.  You will find that some tools, such as screwdrivers and pliers, are allowed, but they must be no longer than seven inches.  Banned items, which must be stored in your checked luggage, include axes, crowbars, saws, drills, and hammers.  

As previously mentioned, sharp objects are prohibited aboard most airplanes. These items can be stored in your checked baggage, but they are not allowed aboard the plane in your carryon luggage. The only exception is scissors that are have blades shorter than four inches. Sharp objects that you will be only be allowed to store in your checked baggage include knives, swords, box cutters, and ice picks.  

In the event that you need to travel with any of the above mentioned items, you are advised to plan ahead first.  It is important that you store any of the previously mentioned items in your checked baggage.  You will be unable to pass through airport security checkpoints until after your baggage has been checked. This means that you if you are caught with a prohibited item in your carryon luggage, in most cases, it will be too late to have that item rechecked.  Instead, you will most likely end up having to hand it over to airport security, never to see your item again. When it doubt, check it or leave it at home. Those are the best ways to ensure that you do not lose anything of great value.
