Antique Carpet

Antique type carpets help to add a touch of grandeur
and glamour to your home or office, speaking greatly
about your rich and extravagant tastes.  Antique
carpets are beautiful home furnishings and solid
art investments.  They aren't just decorative items,
but pieces of tradition, ethniticity, and true class
that dates back thousands of years.

Antique carpets represent enormous range in motifs
and color harmonies and you'll simply lose yourself
seeing the diverse combinations of rich antique
colors and heavy intricate weaving.

The diverse range of antique carpet pieces that you'll
encounter while shopping for them are mostly Oriental
carpets and rugs that portray the mystery and legend
of the far off lands of the Orient.  

Antique carpets and rugs are imported mostly from China, 
Persia, India, Afghanistan, Caucasus, and Turkey.
Some of the famous weaving areas of such antique carpets
include Kashan, Agra, and many other locations.

Antique carpets have a more artistic integrity, as
they are exclusively hand woven.  They are sold all 
over the world, with clients more than willing to pay 
whatever they have to in order to redefine their home and
decorate in style.

If you are looking to add luster and glamour to your 
home or office and are ready to spend a fortune on the
exquisite pieces of art, then you shouldn’t wait a single
minute.  

The first thing to do, is contact one of the several
reliable, knowledgeable, and genuine art dealers
and galleries who deal in antique carpets and
have profound knowledge about the various aspects
of a good and genuine antique carpet.  They can
guide you in selecting the best one per your
budget and tastes.

You've got a bit of work to do as well.  You should
visit a lot of dealers and educate yourself
about dyes, wools, design quality, and the many 
styles of weaving as well.  Touch the carpet and
scrutinize them carefully.  Beware of the machine
made synthetic carpets that some dealers will
tell you are antique carpets.

Below, are some tips to help you when buying 
antique carpet.
	1.  You have to remain careful and thoughtful
while analyzing each piece of antique carpet.
	2.  You'll also need to try and understand
the age and origin of the carpet that will in 
turn give you a much better insight about the 
overall quality of the carpet.
	3.  You'll also need to look and see if
the edge and borders are there in the antique
carpet you intend to buy, as the end and edge
borders are sometimes lost or even cut out on
purpose.  Keep in mind that the borders will
determine the overall value of your carpet.
	4.  Keep an eye out for holes and moth 
attacks that are both common when dealing with
antique carpets.  These problems must be attended
to before you buy the carpet.
	5.  You should always deal with dealers who
have the prices marked on the carpet.  See to it
that your dealer sticks to that price.
