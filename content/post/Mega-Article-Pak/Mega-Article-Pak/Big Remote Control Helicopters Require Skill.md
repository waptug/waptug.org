Big Remote Control Helicopters Require Skill

If space is not an issue for you, then you might be able to consider purchasing some of the new big remote control helicopters that recently were introduced from multiple brands.  These helicopters, which can sometimes be as large as ten feet long, rival real helicopters in agility and of course, in price.  They can run you up to 3 thousand dollars, or so I have heard.

But like many crazes, some people think that they just have to own one of their own.  So now, if you go out to a long, open plain, you might see some of these big remote control helicopters flying around, and at first you’ll probably think they are real helicopters that are simply further away then you first think.  But then you’ll probably see someone else controlling the helicopter through their equally big remote control, and then you’ll know the truth.

If you get a chance to see one of these in flight, consider yourself lucky.  With the tremendous expense of owning one of these beauties, comes their rarity.  Of course, being an avid collector myself, I have considered purchasing one of these big remote control helicopters, and I even put a bid on one in Ebay, but I ended up not getting it and instead deciding to wait until the price goes down a little bit.

Like with any other huge commodity, big remote control helicopters are the it factor now, but in a few years, I am sure they will overcome the demand with a bigger supply, and then I’ll be ready and waiting to purchase.  Until then, I have a very generous and rich friend who owns one, and I will practice flying it on his.  I have already taken it out once, and it’s so much more powerful than the typical small remote control helicopters that you may be used to.  When you first turn it on, the big remote control helicopter’s blade spins with such ferocity, you may worry that you’re going to blow away.  When it lifts off the ground, you will probably feel a huge sense of accomplishment, knowing that you are the one that is controlling it.

And if you’re able to nail the landing, then you can consider yourself a true helicopter connoisseur, because even those very well versed in small remote control helicopters would be impressed to see someone land a big remote control helicopters—it’s a whole different ball game, really.  So if you happen to be lucky, rich, or determined enough to purchase one of your own, or if you’re able to practice on a friend’s helicopter like me, enjoy your time with your large helicopter.

I guarantee it’ll be one of the most exhilarating experiences of your life.  For me, the entire process was unreal, and when it was all over, I had to call everyone I knew and tell them how I flew a 10 foot helicopter and prevented it from crashing.  I bet that’s how pilots feel the first time they fly a fighter jet.  It’s just incomprehensible unless you try it for yourself.
