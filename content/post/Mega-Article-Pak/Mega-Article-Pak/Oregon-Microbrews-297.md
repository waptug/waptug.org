Oregon Microbrews

To get the most out of a visit to Oregon, you'll need
to try a local craft beer.  Even if you don't like
to drink craft beer, it's something you should at 
least experience.

If you are knew to microbrews, you should know that 
just because the beer is a microbrew, it doesn't mean
that you'll need a knife and fork to drink it.  All
over the state, you'll find several different 
microbreweries that offer everything you could ever
want.

All mass produced American style lagers have set a
rather disappointing standard for the beer drinkers
of the country.  These beers can only be as good as
their ingredients.  Instead of the fine grains such
as barley and wheat, corn and rice are often used
as cheaper replacements.  In place of the whole kiln
hops, the bigger breweries rely on small pellets of
compressed hop dust.  

Throughout the state of Oregon, there are more than
50 breweries that provide both locals and visitors
with many alternatives to drinking.  The microbrewed
craft will rely on tradition, using the more 
expensive ingredients in place of money saving
shortcuts.  The implication here, is that these
types of beer are normally bitter or overly sweet.

Anytime you visit an unfamiliar brewpub, there is a
great way to sample a variety of brews without 
having to buy a whole pint.  Several pubs offer a
sampler tray with five to seven two ounce beers, 
often labeled to avoid any type of confusion.

Throughout Oregon, microbrews are very popular, in
the pubs and on the street.  You can find many 
different varieties, more than you can find in 
other states.  If you don't live in Oregon, and you
get the chance to visit, you shouldn't hesitate
to check out some of the excellent microbrews.
