Picking The Right Golf Club In Every Situation

When playing golf, the most important part of the game is to pick the golf club that will work well for the particular situation that you are in. Everything about the course will play a role in deciding which club you remove from your bag, and therefore it is important to know how all of these different factors work together. If you are looking to become more serious about your golf game, or you even want to become a professional, then it is a good idea to learn about these things. Here I will outline some of these main things to look for. You will get a very basic idea of how to choose a club, and hopefully you will practice enough to become even more knowledgeable at choosing them.

When you first start out the game, you usually won’t have much to worry about in the way of obstacles and bends in the course, so you can stick with the larger clubs and hit the ball as far as you can. However, you want to make sure tat you are comfortable hitting the ball as hard and as far as you can without making it go completely off its desired path. Many golfers choose to take a step up with the club, then take a lower grip and hit the shot as hard as they can. Having the lower grip will allow for more control over the swing, and reduce the chance of a mistake while increasing the distance that your ball flies. This strategy may not work for you, but enough golfers use it that it might be worth trying, just to see if you are comfortable with it.

The wind also plays a huge role in deciding with what club and with what technique you will hit your shot. If the wind it coming straight at you, you will have a different technique than if it was at your back. When the wind is coming from behind you, you will want to make a completely normal swing. However, you will have to pick a more lofted club. Grip the club with the ball positioned a little bit ahead of the center than regular. Use a mid-iron, with one of the longer lengths that are available in your club bag. If the wind is coming straight at you from the front, you will have to use a stronger club and hit the ball hard enough to make up for the wind that is coming at you. 

Choosing the right club in a given situation will not necessarily make your shot perfect. You will have to adjust your technique as well, and make sure that your stroke is clean and accurate. This combined with the right club will eventually make for the perfect shot, but it may take years and years of golf practice. Both the club choice and the technique take a long time to master, so besides reading information about them you should also go out and practice plenty so that you can really get it down. This will help better than any other guide that you could possibly find. If you don’t have constant access to a golf course, it may be a good idea to buy a membership or even find some sort of alternative way to practice.

No matter what you do, you have to remember that golf is a game of patience. If you play every day and you see absolutely no improvement in your technique, you should not worry. Just do everything you can to find out more about what to do in certain situations, and you will find that this is the best way that you can see noticeable results in your abilities. Being good at golf is a great way to impress people, and being good at golf takes nothing more than time and experience.
