Getting Your Credit Card Online

We all get credit card offers through traditional snail mail, and we all know how they work.  Although many credit card offers in the mail claim that you are already pre approved, you still have to wait weeks and weeks before you hear anything back once you apply.  These days are long gone though, as the Internet has made everything easier.  With the Internet, you can apply for a credit card online and receive a response if minutes - instead of waiting weeks and weeks.

If you have good credit, you’ll have no problems at all being approved online for a credit card.  Those cards that have the best terms and rates are always available for those who have good credit.  Therefore, before you apply online, you should know how good your credit is.  You can always get a free credit report online, and check your credit yourself.  If you do this at least twice a year, you’ll always know where you stand with your credit.

If you don’t know your credit score of if you haven’t looked at your credit report in a long time, now would be the time to do so.  Look over your credit report, and fix anything that doesn’t add a positive to your report.  Always keep in mind that even being turned down for a credit card online can affect your credit score as well, and play a major role with future credit offers.

Once you have looked at your credit report and determined how good your credit is, you can apply online for an immediate answer.  No matter which credit card company you visit online, they will all ask for your personal information, such as your name, phone number, social security number, age, employer, income, and things of that nature.  

Before you fill out the application online for your new card, you should always go over the terms and conditions very carefully.  You should look at the APR, and ensure that there are no surprises.  Once you have applied, the company will use your social security number to pull your credit report and use it to determine your credibility and whether or not they can be approved for a credit card.

When you begin filling out the application, you should make sure that the website you are using is encrypted.  The standard encryption these days is SSL 128-bit, which ensure that the information you are sending is protected.  If the website has less than 128-bit encryption, it may be possible for someone else to steal your information - which could result in identity theft.

Once you have finished filling out the application and send it on, you’ll have the final decision in a matter of minutes.  If you are using a credit card company with the right technology, the decision will be shown on the screen.  If the decision isn’t shown on the screen, it will be mailed to you via traditional snail mail.  In the event that you don’t get approved, you’ll be mailed the reason why.

If you’ve been approved, you can expect to receive your credit card in the mail within a few days.  Applying for a credit card online is always the preferred way to receive a credit card, as things will work much faster.  No more waiting for weeks at a time to receive a response, as you’ll know instantly.  There are hundreds of online credit card companies looking for your business - which gives you plenty of choices when choosing the credit card - and company that is best for you.
