Beach Vacations For Winter

During the winter months, finding a beach vacation
spot can be a little difficult.  It doesn't have
to be, which is where this article will really come
in handy.  Below, you'll find some resorts that
offer a unique twist to your winter beach vacation.

1.  Molokai Ranch and Lodge
On a white sand shore on the tiny Hawaiian island of
Molokai, guests will stay in comfortable yet unique
tents.  Each double unit canvas bungalow sits on 
wooden platforms, offers queen size beds in one 
unit, twin beds in the other, solar powered lights,
and a private bathroom with hot water showers.

The Molokai Ranch and Lodge offers over 54,000
acres, including seaside cliffs with very lush
valleys.  The outdoor activities here include sea
kayaking, cultural hikes, mountain biking, and
horseback rides.  For the kids, the lodge offers
nature walks, horse stables, tidal pools and 
Hawaiian arts and crafts.

2.  Grand Wailea Resort and Spa of Hawaii
Long ago, a big swimming pool was enough to make
guests happy.  Now days, resorts compete in water
activities such as lagoons, waterfalls, water 
slides, and even lazy rivers.

The Grand Wailea Resort offers several attractions,
such as the 4,580 square foot Hibiscus pool, 
and the 25,700 square foot Canyon Activity pool
which is great for families.  

3.  Atlantis Resort of the Bahamas
In the amazing water fun department is the unique
Atlantis Resort and Spa on Paradise Island in
the Bahamas.  Along with the beach, the Atlantis
has eleven swimming pools, Mayan Temple water
slides, and lazy river rides.  The Atlantis
also boasts an amazing marine habitat, with
exhibit lagoons that house more than 50,000
sea animals.

4.  Club Med Punta Cana
Over the last several years, the Dominion 
Republic has been working very hard to establish
itself as a destination for families, with many
all inclusives being built.  This location has
all the perks of a tropical resort plus stand
out features that include kids programs, and 
other attractions that make Club Med Punta Cana
one of the most unique beach vacation spots in
the entire world.

5.  Virgin Islands
The US Virgin Islands National Park is a very 
unique vacation spot with white sandy beaches, and
lodging in comfortable tent cottages.

As with the Molokai Ranch, guest cottages are built
on platforms and designed to be both attractive
and comfortable.  Each one has a sleeping area,
bed linen, towels, kitchen utensils, stove, ice
cooler, and even a private deck.

Water sports for the area include kayaking, wind
surfing, snorkeling, and scuba diving.  There is 
also an outdoor restaurant and a food store for
those who want to cook from the privacy of their
own room.
