How to Make a YouTube Video

Are you interested in making your own videos to upload to YouTube and to share with the rest of the internet community?  If you are and if this is your first time trying to do so, you may be wondering how you can go about making your own videos.  Although the process of making a YouTube video may seem like a complicated one, it isn’t necessarily.  Even those with a low amount of computer knowledge are able to successfully make their own videos, many of which later end up on YouTube.

The first step in making a YouTube video is to get a video recording device.  Video recording devices come in a number of different formats.  For instance, it is possible to use cell phones, webcams, or traditional camcorders.  If you are interested in using your cell phone to help you make a YouTube video, you will need to make sure that your cell phone has video recording capabilities.  You will find that most new, modern cell phones do.  For the best quality videos, you want to use traditional camcorders, particularly digital ones, but webcams are also nice low-cost alternatives.

Once you have a video recording device in your possession, you can start to make your own videos.  Popular videos on YouTube include video blogs, comedy skits, how-to videos, or travel videos.  You can make just about whatever type of video you want, whether it is one that is staged or just recording spur of the moment activities or conversations. When making a YouTube video, it is important to remember that YouTube doesn’t limit the number of videos you can submit, but all videos must be ten minutes or less, if you have a traditional YouTube membership account.  Therefore, if you want to have videos be longer than ten minutes, you either need to upgrade your account or make your videos in different segments. 

When making your YouTube video, you will want to make sure that the quality is good.  For this, it is a good idea to speak directly into the camera or else use raised voices.  This will help to ensure that those watching your videos on YouTube can actually understand what you are saying.  It is also advised that you make sure the lighting is good.  The best time to make movies is during the day.  If you want to make your movies at night, whether they take place inside or outdoors, you will want to make sure that you have the appropriate amount of lighting.  Nothing is worse that watching a video that is hard to see.

Although there are a number of steps, like the ones mentioned above, which you can take to ensure that your YouTube videos are quality ones, there is a way that you can fix problems later on. You can do this with movie editing software.  Moving editing software allows you to preview and edit your videos, should you wish to do so before uploading them to YouTube.  If you have a relatively new computer, you should be able to find movie editing software already on your computer.  If you are unable to find movie editing software, you should be able to get free software programs or even purchase deluxe software programs online or from one of your local media stores.  

The decision as to whether or not you want to edit your videos, before sharing them on YouTube, is yours to make, but it is advised that you at least look into doing so, especially if your computer already has a movie editing program.  You will want to watch your movies and see if there is anything that you would like to edit, change, or remove.  If so, the time to do it is before you post your video on the YouTube website.  Editing your YouTube videos or at least previewing them first is likely to improve their quality, which, in turn, will help to improve the exposure that your YouTube videos get.  Many YouTube members share videos that they find interesting with those that they know and your videos may be one of them.
