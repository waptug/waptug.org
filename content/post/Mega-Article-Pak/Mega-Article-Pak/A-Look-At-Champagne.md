A Look At Champagne

Traditionally, Champagne has always a way to celebrate milestones or toast the bride and groom on their marriage.  Considered to be a flexible beverage, Champagne can be served with a meal or with dessert.  For many years, this truly refreshing and exotic drink has been used as a way of celebration and just enjoying the times that lie ahead.

Champagne comes from the vineyards of the French region.  If you get a bottle and notice Champagne imprinted on the label, you can rest assured that the bottle was produced in the vineyards of France.  If you don’t get Champagne that was produced in the infamous French regions, you are pretty much just buying the standard sparkling wine.  You should also make sure that the bottle is spelled “Champagne”, with a capital C.  French manufacturers are very protective of this very name, and therefore are the only ones that are authorized to use it.

Champagne is made using three different types of grape - Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier, and Chardonnay.  Noir and Meunier are types of black grapes, while the well known Chardonnay is a type of white grape.  The label on the bottle will signify what type of Champagne you are buying, so you’ll know what flavor to expect.  There are also types of this wine that are a blend of different grapes, providing quite an exquisite taste to say the least.

Much like sparkling wine, Champagne is very common with celebrations and such.  Although it is actually considered to be a type of sparkling wine, Champagne is much better.  You have to be careful where you buy it though, as a lot of manufacturers like to use cheaper grapes, which don’t taste the same.  If you have ever tasted this wine before - you’ll know first hand what quality tastes like.

A lot of people prefer Champagne because of the bubbles that are known to spew forth once a bottle has been uncorked.  The bubbles that spew from this wine are the result of tiny drops of liquid that are disturbed by the carbonic acid gas.  Once the liquid is disturbed, the bubbles form and short out of the bottle.  This is a natural reaction of the double fermentation process that can only be found with a bottle of Champagne.

The next time you have a celebration and need something to make the celebration a bit more interesting, you should grab a bottle of Champagne.  Few things compliment a celebration like the bursting bubbles of a fine bottle.  You can find quality Champagne at ABC stores or other stores that sell alcoholic beverages.  Even though it may cost you a bit of money - when you pop the top you’ll be glad you bought it.
