Wood Or Vinyl Mini Blinds

The market for mini blinds has expanded well past
those traditional aluminum blinds that break,
bend, and warp.  A lot of homeowners are now
electing to install a 2 inch blind made from 
either wood or vinyl to add a nicer touch to a
room.

Proving to be cheaper than wooden shutters and 
able to allow more light in, these blinds will
combine function and design which helps produce
a look that everyone will like.  Years ago, the
purchase of these two inch blinds would break
the bank, although now there are many options
available for those on any type of budget.

Keep in mind that there are both pros and cons
to choosing either wood or vinyl.  The biggest
difference in the material of the two is the
price and the color.  Normally, wooden two 
inch blinds are a lot more expensive than vinyl
blinds, although they are available in more colors.

If you have strained wooden trim and molding
around your windows, you should consider adding
that specific color to your window treatments.
A dark wooden blind or a honey hue wooden window
blind can make a big difference when it comes
to the look and style of your home.  For a 
price, you can create an inspiring look that
makes the difference between and alright room
and an amazing room.

Always remember that wooden blinds can tend 
to a bit lighter than vinyl, so they could be
an ideal choice for double or triple windows
to prevent bowing in the middle of the blind.
Just like vinyl, wooden blinds can be custom
cut to fit the exact requirements of your 
window.

Vinyl blinds are also a bit less expensive and
can easily be mistaken for the wooden variety.
If you are choosing a bright white or a soft
ivory for your shades, vinyl will be the perfect
choice if you are on a budget.  Vinyl blinds
are also easier to clean, as water can warp
wood or even cause the finish to crack or
bubble.

If you are planning to purchase wood or vinyl
blinds, you should consider paying a visit to
your local supply warehouse.  The selection at
most stores can be dramatic, as they offer
good prices and a variety of choices.  

If your budget isn't a problem at all, you
should look towards a special window treatment
shop in your area, where professionals will 
come to your home and take care of both the
measuring and installation for you.
