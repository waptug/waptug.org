For an even more enjoyable snowmobiling experience, many Vermont resorts offer daily guided tours to their guests and customers. The guided tours are led by experienced professionals who are expert snowmobilers and ones who know the area’s terrain very well.

In order to operate a snowmobile in Vermont, there are a few things that a visitor must know. Riders in Vermont must have completed a sufficient number of hours in a snowmobile safety course before they can be approved to ride in Vermont. Snowmobilers in Vermont are also required to travel at speeds that are safe according to the current weather and trail conditions. State law prohibits riders from exceeding 35 miles per hour on with their equipment. However, riders are allowed to travel up to 50 miles per hour on frozen lakes because they are considered to be highways in the state of Vermont. Normal vehicle laws also apply. It is illegal to operate a snowmobile while intoxicated and all traveling snowmobiles must have functioning headlights, rear lights, and brake lights along with property functioning brakes and other features. 

Even though Vermont requires snowmobilers to abide by several laws and restrictions, these guidelines are designed so that all snowmobiling visitors will be able to enjoy the available opportunities.
