Gift basket Wahm business

If you are creative and like to make gifts for others, then a work at home gift basket business might be right for you. Making gift baskets to sell is rewarding and fun. Many people like the idea of giving personalized baskets for holidays, birthdays and special events but don’t have the time to put them together. When you start a gift basket business, you’ll be supplying them with something they need and getting the opportunity to put your talents to work.

Before you start your life as a gift basket Wahm, make sure that this business is something that you really want to do. If you’ve never made gift baskets, but like the idea, try making one or several for your next gift-giving event. This will also be an opportunity to show off your gift basket making skills to your friends and family. While you are planning and making your gift baskets ask yourself if this is something you can see yourself doing on a regular basis. 

Making some sample gift baskets will also give you an idea of how much your supplies will cost and how much time it will take you to complete each basket. This will help you gauge pricing when you start your business. However, keep in mind that when you get a business license you will be able to buy craft supplies for wholesale prices. 

Getting a business license is an important step in making yourself into an official Wahm. The process is simple and there are many tax benefits to becoming a legal businessperson. You will also get your supplies at wholesale and be able to get discounts on other business related expenses.

Once you’ve decided that making gift baskets is right for you, it’s time to develop your catalog of basket options and prices. Think up a few prototypes for different situations. Although gift baskets are popular during the holiday season, you can also create them for graduations, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Valentine’s Day and other events. Create a few different gift basket ideas and then ask your friends and family for their opinions. Make sure your choices of design and gift basket items are popular with many people before you make them part of your catalog.

Have your prices ready for both standard baskets and custom baskets, and then make your business cards and start advertising. By now, your friends and family will know about your business and you can tell them to spread the word on your new venture. Network with other local businesses, like nail salons and florist shops, to get your name in front of more people. Targeting businesses that are frequented by women is a good tactic because women are more likely to purchase your baskets. 

Around the holidays, corporate companies are looking to buy gifts for their clients and suppliers. This can lead to a lucrative seasonal business for you. You should start marketing your corporate gift business in October at the latest. Network with your husband’s employers and the employers of your friends and family.

Being a gift basket Wahm is a great way to show of your creativity and provide a valuable service at the same time. The rewards are many and with planning and initiative, it can be a very profitable business venture for you.
