Picking Golf Clubs To Complement Your Playing Technique

If you are in the market for golf clubs, you have likely heard a bunch about how choosing the right ones can affect your game in a positive manner. You have probably heard that if you don’t buy the right golf clubs, you will end up playing a terrible game every time you pick them up. However, any seasoned golfer will tell you that this is not necessarily true. You don’t need to spend an insane amount of money on the nicest golf clubs possible. Not only it is a waste of money, it also has almost no benefits for golfers. There are a few things that you do need to pay attention to, but other than those you have the freedom to pick golf clubs that appeal to you aesthetically, or even better, financially.

The most important thing when picking golf clubs is to get the right length. The traditional way to determine the proper length for almost any person is to measure from their navel to the ground when they are standing straight up. This is by no means the most accurate way to do it, but it should give you a ballpark range. Once you have the basic range figured out, it’s a good idea to give a few clubs some good test swings and find out what feels the best as you swing it. Stick around the range that you initially figured out, but feel free to try ones that are a bit longer or a bit shorter. The more you experiment with, the more you will be able to be sure that you are really getting what you need.

One choice that you will be faced with is the choice of graphite or steel. Graphite is often marketed as though it were some sort of amazing material that automatically beats everything else on the market. The sooner you realize that this is not true, the sooner you will be able to make a good financial decision on your golf clubs. Graphite is a decent material, but in all truth it is not for everyone. Every golfer plays at his or her best with a certain amount of flex in the shaft of the golf club. Graphite allows for a different level of flex. If you are used to playing with this level, then graphite is fine. Otherwise, the stiffer steel should be fine. Steel is also more reliable and long-lasting, so you get a longer lifespan for less money.

While golfing magazines and advertisements will usually try to tell you that the new models of golf clubs are much better and more preferable, you should understand something. They are still just long sticks with a head on the end – the same as they have been for decades. You may think that buying an older or used set of golf clubs is taking the cheap and undesirable way out, but there is nothing wrong with saving some money by going with the older models. They are usually of very high quality, and will not cost you too much at all. It’s very reasonable, and will pay off for you in the end. You can find used golf clubs or older models in all sorts of venues, from auctions to the internet.

The best thing to do when in the market for golf clubs is to not get caught up in the hype surrounding the top-of-the-line golf clubs. Many golfers are excited by all of the new features and functionality, and fail to recognize that the newer golf clubs have little more to offer than older ones, besides a much higher price point. So look at it objectively and consider what your money is worth, so that you can avoid wasting an unnecessary amount. When you are a more seasoned golfer, you’ll be glad that you started out at the level you belong at.
