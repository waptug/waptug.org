The Sexy Side of Vegas Shows

If you've never been to Vegas or experienced one of the many Vegas shows that are available to behold, let me be the first to tell you: they are not created equal. People will choose to see shows for many different reasons and there is no right or wrong reason to see any Vegas show unless you are simply determined to hate it from the beginning. Even then you might find yourself to be either mildly or wildly surprised.

I would be remiss if I didn't take the time to mention some of the wonderfully sexy shows that are prominent in Vegas at the moment. There are quite a few and will appeal to audiences on different levels and for different reasons, well some of them will at any rate while most of them offer universal appeal to certain members of the audience it is important to remember the statement I made earlier, not all shows are created equally and it doesn't really matter how beautifully endowed the members of the cast are if the show has no wit, humor, drama, or interesting points about it.

Les Foiles Bergere is one of the best examples of a classic Vegas style show or at least my interpretation of what a Vegas style show should be. This show literally sizzles with its sex appeal and is a great show to kick off your stay in Vegas. You'll be ready to roll the dice after seeing this show for sure. There are generally two shows offered. The 7:30 show is covered so that all ages can enjoy the show all others feature topless numbers and request that audience members be 16 and over. The show can be seen at 7:30 and 10:00 on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Tuesday and Friday offer one show only at 8:30 and Sundays are dark. This is a can't miss show and a real hit for the Tropicana Las Vegas.

If you want to go even more darkly erotic, John Stagliano's Fashionistas is definitely the route you should take. This is a very erotic experience everything about this show simply sizzles. Not only is the choreography and costume design stellar, this show has some of the best music to be found in Vegas with songs by Evanescence, Madonna, Led Zeppelin, Lords of Acid, and Crystal Method.

La Femme, playing at the MGM Grand is a rather unique show, even for Vegas, in that it literally celebrates that artistry of the nude. The overall affect is a stunning visual display of light, color, sound, flesh, and dance. You must be 18 or older to attend this particular show and there is a dress code for the performances, which is business casual so come dressed appropriately. Shows are Wednesday through Monday at 8:00 and 10:30 pm. If you want to see the ultimate water cooler show, this one is definitely the show to see. 

There are so many shows in Vegas that it would be virtually impossible to mention each and every one. These are each excellent examples of the sexiest shows that Vegas has to offer. Only you can decide what you are comfortable seeing and if you're curious try one of the shows that offers an optional covered showing rather than making yourself uncomfortable or putting yourself in the position to be uncomfortable. The main purpose of going to Vegas is to enjoy yourself. Do what makes you happy.
