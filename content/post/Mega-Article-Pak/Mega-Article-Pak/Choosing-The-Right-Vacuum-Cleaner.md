Choosing The Right Vacuum Cleaner

As history indicates, the first model vacuum cleaner
wasn't even a vacuum cleaner at all, more of a carpet
sweeper.  This was invented by a man named Daniel
Hess, who in 1860 patented a machine that featured
rotating brushes on the bottom and bellows that 
helped to create suction.

However, there is no evidence that this very machine
was ever produced. Some 40 years or so later, in 
1908, James Spangler of Canton, Ohio received a
patent for the very first portable electric vacuum
cleaner.  It was in fact his cousin in law, William
Hoover, who lent his name to the legendary company
that produces quality vacuum cleaners even today.

For more than 150 years, the vacuum cleaner has
been improved upon greatly.  From doing your weekly
vacuuming of your home, doing a spring cleaning, 
or simply leaving the vacuuming up to the robot, 
there is a vacuum out there suited to your needs.
With upright, canister, HEPA filtered, bagged and
bagless, there is always a vacuum cleaner for your
needs on the market.

There are actually 2 ways in which a vacuum cleaner
cleans.  The first, and the way we rate a vacuum
on most is how debris and dirt is picked up off
of a carpet and the floor.  When you are searching
for a vacuum, keep in mind the power of the 
suction motor, as this is very important for getting
good performance.

The second reason, one that isn't often thought 
about, is how well the vacuum filters the air and
puts it back into the home.  Those with allergy 
problems will find a HEPA vacuum to be the best
choice.  There are some models of HEPA vacuums
that can filter out 99% of pollens, dust, and
other common household allergens.

There is also the choice of canister or upright
vacuum, as this is more or less based on personal
preference.  Both vacuum types have their pros and
cons.  The heads of canister vacuums are able to 
reach under your furniture, also making it easier
to vacuum the stairs as well.  

Canister vacuums on the other hand have a retractable
electric cord, which is much more convenient than
wrapping the cord back around the neck of the
vacuum.  It is often times easier to push the light
weight canister vacuum head as opposed to pushing 
a canister style vacuum.  

When you choose your vacuum cleaner, keep in mind
what you plan to vacuum.  There are several designs
and types intended for different uses.  If you have
hardwood floors, you obviously wouldn't want to
use a carpet vacuum.

The little things such as this will be a huge factor
in selecting your vacuum cleaner.  If you play 
your cards right, you'll have the perfect vacuum
cleaner for your home - and other areas as well.
