Gun Control Under Debate

After the recent massacre at Virginia Tech, once again the mammoth issue of gun control has been brought up at full force.  Many are highly upset that even after gun control laws have been enacted that the killer in the massacre was approved for a gun and purchased it in less than 30 minutes.  Many have speculated that had there been much harsher guidelines in place, that the sale would not have been completed, and it could have potentially saved all of the lives that were tragically lost in the disaster.  

The death toll from the massacre has risen to over 30 killed and more than 20 wounded.  This is aside from the emotional damage that has been caused to the hundreds who are left grieving in the wake, and those who experienced first hand the trauma of the event.  How can such events really be avoided?  Is it possible to avoid such tragedy with firmer gun laws?  

What about the programs that offer rewards in the form of video game systems, computers and even cash in exchange for turning guns into the police?  Are these programs effective?  In order to truly control guns, there has to be consensus around the country where everyone agrees that it is time for a change and the change occurs quickly, and without opposition.  Gun laws are clearly too lax, and our country needs to take action to avoid scenes like those in Virginia from reoccurring.  

The chances of something such as this happening are almost impossible.  Neither side of the political arena can agree with the other side about what appropriate gun control is, and with many residents of the United States being avid hunters whom use riffles and shotguns on an almost daily basis, it makes it very difficult to control all of the actions and movements that occur.  

Consider that many weapons used in crimes are illegally obtained; it makes it very difficult to determine how effective the stiffer gun laws would really be.  With a new Presidential Primary due to start in the near future, it will seem as if there will be much heavy debate over how to control the flow of guns into the hands of those who are dangerous, or potentially dangerous.  

Facts remain, that while the election is likely to focus on this issue, there is still the issue of preserving the Constitutional right to "bear arms" as long as it is done legally, and those who already have the weapons currently can potentially be just as dangerous as those looking to purchase the guns in the future.  We are left with the task of trying to avoid the tragedy as much as possible.  

Colorado stepped up to the plate with a swift action enacting much stiffer gun laws after the Columbine school massacre in which two teenage boys entered their school donning trench coats and heavy weapons leaving a wake of blood and fallen students in the path.  Colorado decided to avoid future incidents and enact the tougher laws.  It is suspected that Virginia will follow in this path.  The fate of the country rests in the hands of those elected to the public offices to help determine exactly how far gun control should go, and how the changes should occur.
