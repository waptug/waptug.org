Whole House Air Purifiers:  Do They Exist?

When shopping for an air purifier in your local department store, what do you tend to see?  Many department stores only carry a limited selection of air purifiers.  Many times these air purifiers are only designed to handle one or two rooms.  Unfortunately, this leads many individuals to believe that there is no such thing as a whole house air purifier. The good news is that if you are looking for a whole house air purifier, you can have one because they do exist.

As previously mentioned, many department stores only carry a small selection of air purifiers. There are a number of different reasons why these air purifiers only tend to be air purifiers that are designed for small spaces, instead of the whole house.  One of those reasons is because of limited floor space. In retail, retailers often try and place as many items inside their stores as they possibly can. Sometimes, larger items, especially items that may take up a large amount of space, are left out.  The lack of space is why a large number of traditional department stores do not carry whole house air purifiers; however, it is important to note that some will.

If you are looking for a whole house air purifier, you are advised to check out your local home improvement store, especially if you would like to shop locally.  Home improvement stores tend to have a focus on home improvement projects.  Technically, improving the air inside your home, especially the whole house, can be considered a home improvement project. That is why a large number of home improvement stores carry a selection of air purifiers, including those that are designed for the whole house.

In addition to shopping at a local home improvement store, you should also be able to find whole house air purifiers online. In fact, if you are looking for the best prices or a larger selection of products, you may want to give online shopping some thought.  With online shopping, you can easily compare prices, in a matter of minutes.  When shopping online, you will want to search for the online websites of air purifier manufacturers, as well as the online websites of home improvement stores, home stores, or traditional department stores.

Although whole house air purifiers are ideal, especially if you want to clean up the air inside your whole house, you will often find that they are more expensive, when compared to most traditional air purifiers. In fact, whole house air purifiers can cost anywhere from three hundred dollars to a thousand dollars. Despite this high cost, you need to remember the cost of individual air purifiers.  Depending on the number of rooms in your home, it is almost always cheaper to purchase a whole house air purifier instead of multiple air purifiers for each room.  So, technically, in the long run, you may also be saving yourself money.

Whole house air purifiers work when they are attached to your home’s heating or cooling systems. Despite being attached to your heating or cooling systems, you may find that your whole house air purifier needs maintenance.  This maintenance may include a replacement filter. Whether or not the air purifier of your choice needs replacement filters is extremely important.  When purchasing an air purifier, especially one that needs to have its filters replaced, you need to examine the cost of those replacement filters.  If they need to be changed on a regular basis or if the replacement filters are expensive, you may want to search for a cheaper alternative.  It may take a little bit of work, but they are out there.
