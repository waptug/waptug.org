Universal Studios Tours – It’s Not For Everyone

Unlike Disneyland, Universal Studio Tours are not for 
everyone. While there is plenty to do and see, the 
attractions are not appropriate for all ages. This 
should be strongly considered if you are planning a 
family vacation that includes Universal Studios. 

There are no attractions that are suitable for babies 
or toddlers at Universal Studios. Most babies and 
toddlers will not be interested in the Universal 
Studios Tour. Furthermore, getting a stroller around 
the upper and lower lots is almost impossible. 
Universal Studios is a great place to have some fun 
– unless you are a baby, a toddler, or a parent of a 
baby or toddler.

If you will be taking your vacation with a toddler or a 
baby, you may be better off saving the Universal 
Studios Tour for another vacation – a few years down 
the road. There is no charge for admission for babies 
and toddlers at Universal Studios, but there usually 
isn’t if the person cannot enjoy the attractions at the 
park! Remember – the baby or toddler isn’t the only 
one who won’t be having any fun.
