St Anton in Austria

St Anton in Austria is a world renowned skiing facility, positioned in the belt that is known as Austria’s skiing capital. Only 100 miles from Solden, and with Innsbruck and Otztal close by, visiting Austria on a skiing vacation could not get any easier, or more action-packed. The terrain is varied, and offers excellent opportunities for new skiers, experienced skiers and even snowboarding - that is on-the-up in this region. With 2 mountains, and a top of the range ski lift, skiers have no problems getting from A to B on the 30 000 feet slope. With views looking over the snowy hills and farmland, it is no wonder the area is a thriving hub for tourists, from around the world.

The terrain is varied, as well as the gradients that offer great opportunities for high speed, high octane acceleration, and lesser gradients that assist the new skiers in homing in their skills, 30 000 feet high in the St Anton mountains. St Anton does not have the tradition or acclaim that its neighbour Solden has managed to gain, however many from around the world still choose St Anton as their preference for an international skiing vacation. The reasons for this are simple – its appeals to a different skiing niche. Whilst Solden has hosted many world renowned skiing occasions, it has became too commercialised for some skiers who claim the facility has became to simple, and almost too forgiving on certain slopes. 

With 8 runs and rising, St Anton has failed to give into pressure from around the world, for man-made slaloms, and safety alterations on runs. When you are skiing on certain sloped in St Anton, you have to have your wits about you, or something dangerous could easily happen. The facility has also gained much acclaim from adrenaline junkies in the snowboarding field, who rank St Anton as being one of the best facilities in the world. St Anton’s rise in snowboarding also came as it followed the new trend of offering night-time, freestyle snowboarding under flood lights and fireworks. This is becoming the new trend in snowboarding, and what better place to do it, than at St Anton.  

During my trip to St Anton to check-it-out I found that the hotels around the area were brilliant, making it no problem for English speaking holiday makers to enjoy themselves. I stayed at a luxury 5 star hotel that had an indoor heated swimming pool. The swimming pool peaked out onto the top of a snowy mountain as you bathed in 40 degrees water. 

I would have to say that the general feeling around the area is amazing, as you sense the genuine desire for skiing shared by everyone who goes along and takes part. Before I went I had never been skiing before, and I found the tuition excellent. They had multi-lingual skiing instructors on hand to try and aid any new skiers visiting the slopes. I was also taken to a specific slope that was built for new-starts, which also has an easy access point to a lift - perfect for picking that up as well.  

The area is amazing to look at, and also offers great entertainment for the non-skier, or skier on a night-off! With clubs, pubs and shops all their to service the slopes, it is no wonder that the skiing facility has three 5 star hotels positioned next to the slopes. With all night entertainment within the hotels, and all-night snowboarding it really is impossible to get a minutes rest in St Anton.  Should you visit it is said that the conditions are best around August, however that’s in the peak of the skiing season, making it impossible to get moving around the slopes. In order to benefit from the best conditions, whilst the slopes are quieter I would say November is the best time. You are also more likely to get discounts from your travel agent at this time.
