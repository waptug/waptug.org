If you take your time and look through how these programs are marketed, you may be able to see where you can make a change and offer a better product.

You must study the marketplace and then create a product that fills in the current need.  If you just create a product because you think it is cool, that is not necessarily going to lead to success for you.  You need to see where someone has a need that you can fill and if you can do this, you will have great sales.  See what your competition is doing to solve needs and do this just a little bit better.  Also see what types of customers would shop online at your particular store and also see the culture of these people.  By taking the time to see what your competitors offer as well what people who visit your site are looking for, you are putting yourself in a great position to be able to fulfill their need.  This will lead you to being able to create online business ideas almost at will. Ideas are most powerful when they are backed by research because there is a solid basis for their success.
