Proper Lighting Makes Home Theater Systems

The best possible location for the average home theater would be a basement room that allows very little or no natural sunlight to sneak into the room. There are so many things you can do in a basement that simply intensify the theater experience of your average home theater. From actual stadium or theater seating to rope lights that line the side of the walls (where it meets the floor) for low ambient lighting that will not distract from the screen or cause any unnecessary glare. Out of the many things you can choose to enhance your home theater, lighting might actually be one of the most important as well as the most often overlooked.

If you are fortunate enough to have a basement, this is an ideal location for a home theater but don't despair if you live in a climate that isn't exactly conducive to home basements. Even in the sunshine basement there are steps you can take in order to prevent too much light from affecting your home theater experience. Some good ideas with which to start would be to purchase black out curtains that prevent sunlight from creeping into your room. This looks much better than the old fashioned quick fix of placing aluminum foil over your windows for sure. 

Even within your room if you've taken the time to make sure natural light isn't creeping in you may find that poorly placed lighting adversely affects your viewing pleasure. When installing your home theater system you need to pay careful attention to both natural and artificial light at different times of day in order to see how they affect your ability to see the television (this is particularly important if you have a projection television) as well as in order to see if there is any glare on your television screen from light peeking through your curtains or from lamps and overhead lighting within the room. 

Recessed lighting is a good option for most home theater rooms as is rope lighting as I mentioned above. If you have this type of lighting you can see well enough to move around without interrupting what is taking place on your television screen. Additionally, low lighting in the room makes the actual television become the focal point of the room whenever it is on and the overhead lights are down. 

If you are creating a home theater themed room you might find some of the interesting film era wall sconces of great interest. These sconces prefer low levels of light that are unlikely to interfere greatly with what is happening on your television screen. You can find all kinds of wonderful sconces in a wide variety of themes. It makes sense that with home theater lighting playing such a pivotal role in the overall enjoyment of the home theater experience that many businesses are being created simply to fill this need within the lighting industry.

Some will argue that the television you choose for your home theater is wildly more important than the lighting in the room by far. I tend to disagree. If you do not take care to insure that the lighting in the room isn't appropriate it is unlikely that you will be able to fully enjoy the television you selected. For this reason I always think you should keep your current television for a while, test it out with the lighting and invest in proper lighting before making an investment in a bigger or better television to add to your home theater system. 

All things when it comes to a home theater are relative to personal preference as are all things in life. Take the time to seriously consider the affect that the lighting in the room that will become your home theater will affect your ability to see the movies or television shows that you enjoy so much. Once you have the perfect situation when it comes to lighting you will be amazed at how much more you actually enjoy your home theater.
