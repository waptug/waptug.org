Finding Power Tools for Left Handed People

Most power tools on the market are designed for everyone to use. However, if you happen to be left handed, then you may realize just how difficult it is to operate particular power tools. The on/off switch being in a location that isn’t convenient or easy to get to in the event of an emergency is the most common complaint. 

With saws, the most common complaint for left handed people is that the blade is on the right hand side which makes it difficult for them to operate. The left handed individual has two choices – hold it the wrong way and hope the cut ends up being straight or face it the other way around with the blade coming at you and the materials coming at you. Neither is a very effective option. 

Still, many left handed individuals feel like they have been cheated by the power tool industry. In fact, the Left Handers Club, a group that was formed in 1990, has been sparking the interest in many power tool manufacturers to address the situation. It seems like saws are the one main power tool that hasn’t yet been adapted for left handed individuals. For them, a table saw works best because you can choose to cut on either the right side or the left side of the blade. 

There are some great power tools on the market that can be used easily for left handed individuals including power screwdrivers, routers, nailers, drills, and sanders. This is because the manufacturers have worked hard to redesign them. The on/off switch is generally located in the middle of the power tool so it can be accessed from the right side or the left side. 

A mainly unknown brand of power tool, Porter-Cable, has introduced a circular saw kit that features the blade on the left hand side. The reviews of this power tool show it is very inexpensive, around $100 and sees to work very well for a variety of materials. This might be a great saw for left handed individuals to try out. It seems like it would be much safer than the right handed saw options we discussed above. 

Panasonic offers a cordless drill that is designed for the left handed individual. In addition, it is getting rave reviews for being a great working power tool that recharges very quickly. Unfortunately, there still aren’t enough to make a good selection.

Left handed tool belts are becoming a very popular item manufactured by many tool makers. This is very helpful and a step in the right direction, especially for left handed individuals who work in the construction industry. They commonly wear a tool belt for eight to twelve hours a day, five or six days per week. 

It appears that the power tool industry has made some steps in the right direct when it comes to making the majority of power tools accommodating for both left handed and right handed individuals. Moving the power switch made a huge different on many of these power tools. In the past, left handed individuals had to reach in front of the power tool, and that could be a potential risk for injury. Now most of the major power tools have the power switch in the center. 

Since there are so many left handed people in our society, and it is no longer something looked down on, there is a huge demand for power tools to work for them. Creating power tools that appeal to this market seems like a great opportunity for power tool manufacturers. There has been some progress in this area over the past ten years, and the trend indicates that more changes will continue to meet the power tool needs of left handed individuals. They will be able to purchase power tools that are effective, safe, and work with them instead of them having to find a way to adjust to the right handed set up.
