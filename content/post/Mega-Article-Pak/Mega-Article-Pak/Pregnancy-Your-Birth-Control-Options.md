Pregnancy:  Your Birth Control Options

Are you a woman who is currently unsure as to whether or not you are ready for parenthood?  If that is the case, are you currently sexually active?  If you are, are you using any form of birth control?  Parenting and pregnancy are all important issues, ones that are difficult to back down from. For that reason, if you are not looking to become a mother just yet, it is important that you take the time to familiarize yourself with all of your birth control options.

Perhaps, the most popular and most well-known birth control method is that of condoms. Condoms, in most cases, are highly effective against preventing pregnancy. On rare occasions, they can break or leak, but you are typically safe.  Just be sure to purchase a brand of condoms that is known for their strength and durability.  What is nice about this popular birth control method, is that you are often not only protected against pregnancy, but sexually transmitted diseases as well.

Although condoms are an effective birth control method used by many, there are many women and men who prefer not to use them.  If you are not interested in handling the issue of the birth and upbringing of a child, it is important that you take the time to familiarize yourself with the other options that you have for birth control. A few of those other options, outlined below, are ones that may not be as well-known or as popular as condoms, but they are typically just as effective.

Birth control pills are a hormonal form of birth control.  Birth control pills require the taking of a pill each and everyday of the month. Birth control pills are known as being effective, as long as they are taken as directed. As with many other medications, birth control pills are not ideal for smokers, as they may cause additional health complications.  With a large selection of birth control pills, including ones that eliminate your menstrual period, you are sure to find something that can offer you assistance.

Aside from condoms and birth control, the next most popular form of birth control is another hormonal method. This birth control method is commonly referred to as the Depo shot. The Depo shot has one main downfall and that is that it has been linked to a poor absorption of calcium. That is why many Depo users are urged to take calcium supplements each day. What is nice about the Depo shot is that it is not only effective at preventing pregnancy, but it is also administered on a three-month schedule and periods are often a thing of the past.

Although not as popular as condoms, the Depo shot, and birth control pills, IUDs are also effective forms of birth control.  IUDs are known as Intra-Uterine Devices.  Intra-Uterine Devices (IUDs) come in a number of different formats, but they are still designed to protect you from pregnancy. This is either done with the use of a copper device, which is spermicidal, or ones that release progestin.  

The above mentioned birth control methods are actually just a few of the many that exist, but these birth control methods are designed to prevent pregnancy right from the start.  Should you find yourself in an emergency situation, it is important to know that you have a number of different options, including emergency contraceptives.  These emergency contraceptives can be obtained through your doctor’s office or your local pharmacy. Despite being able to offer you assistance, it is important that you do not use abortion or even emergency contraceptives as a form of birth control. If that is what you have been doing, you have a whole other set of issues that need to be dealt with.

As a reminder, the above mentioned birth control methods can all help to prevent you from becoming pregnant.  With that in mind, the only method of birth control, at this moment, that can protect you from sexually transmitted disease is that of a condom.
