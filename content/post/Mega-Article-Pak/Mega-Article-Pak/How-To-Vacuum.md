How To Vacuum

To maintain the look, feel, and appearance of your
carpet you'll need to vacuum on a regular basis.  If 
you are new to vacuuming, you'll find the tips below
to help you when it comes to keeping your home clean:

	1.  Before you start, you should always inspect
the area.  Pick up any objects that could cause
your vacuum cleaner to clog up.  The smaller objects
are fine, just as long as they will pass through the
vacuum.  

	2.  You should check the vacuum bag to ensure
that is isn't full already.  If it is full, you 
should go ahead and change it.  A full bag isn't
going to suck up much dirt, as the power will be
greatly reduced due to the bag taking up a great 
deal of storage and limiting the suction.

	3.  You should always vacuum forwards instead
of going backwards.  Going forward will get the
job done quicker and you won't wear your cord out
near as fast.  When going backwards, you also run
the risk of running back over your cord, which is
something you don't want to do.

	4.  Be sure that you overlap your strokes
to ensure that you get out all of the dirt and the
residue.  You don't want to miss any of the carpet,
which is why it is important that you overlap your
strokes.

	5.  You should change your vacuuming
direction on occasion to reduce any type of matting
in your carpet.  You can change direction without
any problems.  Doing this every time you make a
sweep on the carpet or every other time you vacuum
will be good.

	6.  On corners, use a damp cloth or a
crevice tool attachment that hooks up to your
vacuum cleaner.  This will ensure that you get the
corners and tight areas good, and they don't 
stand out from the rest of the carpet.

	7.  You can get rid of dust particles and
dirt by waving a vacuum wand under your bed.  Doing
so on occasion will ensure that your bedroom
stays clean, and smells clean as well.

For kitty litter on carpets or floors, you should
use a lightweight vacuum cleaner.  To get deep
into the fibers of the carpet, you should try
an upright vacuum cleaner with a power brush.  Kitty
litter can be a pain in the neck if it gets 
crushed in the pile or embedded, which is why
you should get it out as quick as you can.

Give some thought to purchasing a vacuum cleaner
with a rotating brush or combination beater and
brush bar, which will loosen up the dirt in the
carpet and then suck it out.  This will beat the
dirt from the fibers and even embedded dirt, which
will leave your carpet clean and smelling great.

Whenever you vacuum, you should always be on the
lookout for straw, thread, and string as it can
trap debris in the vacuum hose and result in a 
clog.  These types of hazards are also bad for the
agitators as well, as they can clog up the suction
as well, or get tangled up in the agitators and
cause more problems.

If you have pets, you should sprinkle some baking
soda on the carpet before you vacuum.  Let it sit
for a little while, then vacuum.  The baking soda
is a lot cheaper than carpet fresheners and it
does the same thing - only better.

Vacuuming is very easy to do, and it's something
that should be done on a regular basis.  You don't
have to be an expert to vacuum, all you have to
do is make an effort.  Your carpet will look good
all the time, and your house will stay smelling
great - which is reason enough to grab the vacuum
and take a trip through the house with it.
