Secondhand Mobility Scooters For Sale And Purchase

If a mobility scooter would make a positive difference in your life or the life of a loved one but the cost of a scooter is the obstacle that is preventing you from purchasing one, you may want to consider purchasing a used or secondhand mobility scooter. It is possible to regain some of the independence that an individual may have once enjoyed prior to their walking becoming a difficult task with the help of a mobility scooter. 

Brand new mobility scooters range in price from hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on the make and model of the scooter. Most are powered by electricity via one or two onboard rechargeable batteries. More expensive models usually have two batteries onboard to accommodate a more powerful motor, which is helpful when climbing hills and steep slopes. Convenient features and optional accessories will also increase the price of a new mobility scooter. However, purchasing a secondhand scooter can save hundreds of dollars without sacrificing quality. In addition, purchasing a secondhand scooter from an individual, secondhand specialty store or online auction may allow you the opportunity to purchase a mobility scooter already equipped by the previous owner with many of the accessories that will add to your comfort and convenience without your having to incur additional costs. 

Before you start exploring the landscape in search of a secondhand mobility scooter, you should research the makes and models currently available at a medical supply or similar specialty store or online. Many scooter manufacturers and distributors have websites that include detailed descriptions and articles to help you determine which type of mobility scooter would be best to accommodate the individual needs of the rider.

Purchasing a secondhand mobility scooter from an individual will almost definitely always be an ‘as-is’ sales transaction, meaning you get exactly what you see, exactly as it is at that moment with no implied or expressed guarantee or warranty. Most people seek to sell a used mobility scooter if the previous owner no longer has a need for the scooter or if the previous owner has upgraded to a more sophisticated model. Be prepared to ask the seller the reason for the sale, the original date of purchase and length of the original warranty.  You should also ask if there have been any mechanical difficulties with the scooter in the past. Tires and batteries are considered consumable items that need occasional replacement, so be sure to ask if these items are still original or if they had previously been replaced, and if so when. 

Online auctions provide a popular and convenient method of purchasing a secondhand mobility scooter. EBay is the most popular internet auction site, bringing buyers and sellers of a vast multitude of products together. Simply typing ‘mobility scooter’ in the search bar on EBay will bring you a listing of secondhand scooters for sale. Each of the mobility scooters listed will include a detailed description of the scooter and the seller’s payment, shipping and warranty policies. Most of the listings will also include photographs and you can always contact the seller directly for more information or photographs. The bid will have an ending time, and the buyer who has submitted the highest bid will win the item for the bid price at the end of the auction.  In cases where the seller will accept a certain pre-determined price you will see a ‘buy it now’ icon, which indicates you can purchase the scooter at that price and avoid the bidding process. The buy it now price will most likely still be much lower than purchasing the same scooter brand new, enabling you to reap the benefits of a mobility scooter without draining your bank account.
