Are you the parent of a teenager?  If so, there is a good chance that you are wondering about their safety online, as you should be.

You are the parent, you can do anything that you want; however, there is really no need to. Despite the fact that danger exists, social networking sites are relatively safe, even for teenagers.  However, to be safe and stay safe, your teenager needs to know what to avoid and who to be on the lookout for.

One of the first things that you may want to discuss with your child is who they are talking with online. Although they may not want to give you an answer, you need to emphasize the importance of knowing who they are talking to. Since social networks work to connect individuals who do not physically know each other it may seem impossible, but it can be done. Your child should fully read and try to understand the content of their friend’s online profiles. This will enable them to watch out for inconsistent stories or any inaccurate information.  Tell your teen that if they learn that someone is being untruthful they need to end the conversation right away.  

In addition to who your teen is taking to, it is also important to learn what they are talking about. As with who they are talking to, your teenager may not want to give you a straight answer. Even if you are unable to get an answer out of them it is important to let them know what is appropriate and what is not. Be sure they know that it is best to completely avoid individuals who like to speak of sex, drugs, and other illegal activities.  Although they  may enjoy having a number of online friends, there are plenty of other individuals, especially teenagers, who would more than willing to have pleasant and harmless conversations with them.

Perhaps, the most important thing to discuss with your teenager about social networking sites is arranging physical meetings.  Let them know that these meeting are unacceptable.  There have been numerous reports, over the past few years, of teenagers being lured away from their home in hopes of meeting a new friend, who they thought was their age.  Unfortunately, many of these online friends turn out to be older and, in many cases, sexual predators.  In the event that your teenager wants to meet an online friend and you feel that they would with or without your permission, you may want to offer to go with them. Of course, it is advised that you use caution and all meet in a public place.  

By keeping the above mentioned points in mind, your child should still be able to use social network sites, but use them safely.

Whether you do or not, it is important that you keep your child aware of the dangers that lurk online, awareness is the key.
