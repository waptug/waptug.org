Cruise Ships: A Romantic Getaway for Couples

With large workloads, hectic schedules, and children, many couples need a break from their daily routines.  This break often comes in the form of a romantic getaway.  If you and your partner are searching your next romantic adventure, you may want to examine the possibility of taking a cruise.

When it comes to romantic getaways, there are many who don’t even consider a cruise ship as an option.  However, there are others who literally live for cruises. These couples are likely to take two or more cruises each year.  Whether you’ve been on a cruise ship before or not, it is possible for you and your partner to have a romantic cruise ship getaway.

Before booking a cruise ship getaway, you are encouraged to consider a number of factors.  These factors are important when planning a romantic getaway aboard a cruise ship. There are a number of different cruises ships and cruises lines.  You may be unable to enjoy a romantic vacation if you are on a cruise ship that is overrun with children.  

If you are interested in having an intimate, relaxing, and romantic cruise, you are encouraged to search for a cruise ship that has an age limit for its passengers. These cruise ships often restrict children from coming aboard.  Many times, cruise ships with a passenger age limit target their voyages specifically to couples looking for romance.  

While it is possible to find a cruise ship with an age limit for their passengers, you may find it a bit difficult.  If you are unable to find one, inquire as to where couples with children will be placed.  A number of popular cruise ships work to keep families and individual couples separated.  If this policy is in place, a cruise line is likely to state the policy on their website.  The same information can be obtained by directly contacting a cruise ship representative.  

The size of the cruise ship you are interested in vacationing on is also likely to determine the level of intimacy onboard.  If it is intimacy that you want, a smaller cruise ship may be your best bet.  Larger cruises ships have more passages and more passengers often make it difficult to have onboard, private moments.  A number of romantic cruise lines target their smaller cruise ships to couples looking to vacation alone.  

In addition to the size of the ship, the ships style and décor may determine whether or not you can experience romance onboard.  As previously mentioned, there are a number of cruise lines that target couples looking to vacation alone.  Part of that targeting may include creating a romantic environment.  On romance themed cruise ships, you may find romantic cabins, room service, and other similar services.  

Vacationing aboard a cruise ship is a great way for you and your partner to spend quality time together.  When selecting a cruise ship to vacation on, the intimacy off the ship is just as important as on the ship.  Almost all extended cruise ships dock in a port.  These ports are often located in another country, but not always.  To make the most out of your vacation destination, you will want to consider a cruise line that offers stops in romantic ports.  These ports may include, but are not limited to the Bahamas, Hawaii, or the Caribbean. 

The Bahamas, Hawaii, and the Caribbean all have a number of cruise ship ports.  Additional ports can be found in the Untied States and overseas.  What many passengers enjoy about these particular ports is their climate.  The climate and the overall weather could have an impact on the romance aboard your ship.  Tropical weather tends to add to the romance in the air.  

Cruises ships are often viewed as large, oversized vessels.  In addition to traditional cruise ships, it is possible for you to take a local cruise.  If you are looking for a romantic getaway, but you fear the cost of an expensive cruise, you are encouraged to look into local cruises offered near your home.  These cruises often involve dinner, dancing, and sometimes an overnight stay.  They most often occur on a large river or a lake.

Now that you know what to look for when booking reservations for a romantic getaway aboard a cruise ship, you can start making preparations.  With a small amount of time and research, you could be sailing the seas in luxury, with the one that you love.
