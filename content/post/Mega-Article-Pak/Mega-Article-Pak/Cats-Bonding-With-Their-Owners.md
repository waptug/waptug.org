Cats Bonding With Their Owners

There are a lot of experts out there who say that cats are strictly independent animals.  These very same experts state that cats have chosen to associate with humans due to their strategy of survival.  Although many argue with this statement, there are many who agree as well – although those that agree are normally those in the percentile who don’t agree with cats.

Anyone who has owned a cat will tell you that cats are great at bonding with people, although they are very particular.  Normally, a cat will choose someone in the home that he bonds with.  You’ll know when a cat wants to bond with you, as he will hop on your lap seeking attention or snuggle up to you at night when you are sleeping.  Purring is a strong sign of affections, especially with cats that are looking to bond.

Although many experts have tried to figure it out, no one really knows why cats choose a particular person whom they will bond with.  It could be the individual’s manners, voice, or simply how that person treats the cat.  Perhaps it may be the individual is really gentle, or maybe a little more forceful – bringing the best out in the cat.

There are a lot of ways that researchers have tried to take this subject, one of which being psychic.  Some say that cats bond with someone due to a “psychic aura” that is compatible with both the person and the cat.  If a cat feels that someone is giving them a bad vibe, they will simply ignore that person.  Although this can be true to a sense for some, a majority of those who own cats will tell you that this couldn’t be any further from the truth.

Even though there are a lot of theories and speculation out there, no one really knows why cats bond with humans.  There’s little to no proof available as well, other than cats and their natural instinct for physical survival.  Those who own cats know that cats crave attention, simply to make them feel needed.  They love to be pampered by their owners, and will shower you with attention and affection if you just give them the chance.  

Those who are new to owning cats may find bonding to be very different.  Cats are different from other animals, including dogs, in the sense that they bond different.  Different breeds of cats will bond different with their owners, although most prefer affection and attention.  The more time you spend around your cat, the more he will bond with you.  Over the years, you’ll find that the bond you create with your pet has grown very strong – and simply cannot be broken.
