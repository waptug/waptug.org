Personalized Wedding Favors

Many couples opt to give personalized wedding favors to their guests. Personalized wedding favors are a good idea because they often include the names of the couple as well as the wedding date. This helps to ensure that the guests will remember where they received the favor. Many people attend a large number of weddings throughout their lifetimes and over time the favors they receive at these weddings may become indistinguishable. However, couples who opt to distribute personalized wedding favors often do not have this problem because their guests simply have to look at the gift to remember who gave it to them. They will also be more likely to remember details of the wedding when they receive a personalized wedding favor. This article will provide some information on the types of personalized wedding favors available and will provide some useful information for giving personalized wedding favors.

When giving personalized wedding favor it is very important to plan ahead. This is so important because unlike other wedding favors which can be bought right off the shelves, personalized wedding favors require special processing. Even if the favors are already manufactured, they may still need to go through an additional process to personalize the item. This requires additional time. It will likely take at least a few days for your order to be processed and the manufacturer may have a number of other orders ahead of yours awaiting personalization. This means the wait for personalized orders can be as little as a couple of days but may take a week or even longer depending on the size of your order and how busy the manufacturer is at the time. Rush orders are usually an option but they also usually involve high fees. In fact you will likely find that a rush order may double or even triple the cost of each favor. 

Just about any wedding favor can be personalized. The most popular way to personalize a wedding favor is to include the names of the bride and the groom and the date of the wedding. This can be done on items ranging from candy wrappers to pictures frames and fortune cookies to candle holders. However, including the names of the bride and the groom and the date of the wedding is not the only way to personalize a wedding favor. The couple may opt to have an item personalized with a quotation from their favorite song or poem or with a line or two from their wedding vows.

Another popular option for purchasing personalized wedding favors is to give edible favors. Many different kinds of edible favors can be personalized. Photo cookies are just one example. Many bakeries can produce these cookies based on a photo you submit to them. They may require you to submit the photo electronically or they may be able to scan a photo into their system. The couple can choose to have their photos placed on the cookies and may also include a few words such as the date or a quote from a love song. 

When giving wedding favors, the gift wrapping can also be personalized. Many couples opt to wrap wedding favors in simple white paper but they can also include ribbons with their names and the wedding date to make the favor wrapping more personal. These types of ribbons can be purchased either precut or in one continuous ribbon which must be cut by the person wrapping the favor. The precut ribbons are likely to be more expensive but they can save the person doing the wrapping a great deal of time.
