Gas Versus Diesel

Cost
Due to the high compression ratios and resulting
high cylinder pressure in diesel engines, they
must be built to withstand a lot more punishment
than gas engines.  The parts that are spruced up
include a thicker block and cylinder heads, 
pistons, crankshaft, and valves, which can be
very costly indeed.

When it comes to the price, gas wins this one by
far.  Diesel costs a lot more to own than gas,
which is one of the main reasons why people tend
to choose gas over diesel.

Fuel cost
Diesel fuel is easier to refine, taking less 
time to get from raw petroleum to final product
from gas, giving it a lower price than that of 
gas.  On the other hand, within the United States,
diesel is priced the same or just a bit below
regular unleaded gas.

Noise and vibration
Despite many improvements in noise isolation and
engine noise technology in trucks over the last 10
years, diesels are still much louder and shake 
more than gasoline powered vehicles.  At idle, the
clatter and shake of diesel vehicles are clearly
noticeable, while it can be hard to tell if the 
gas engine is even running.

Cold weather
If you've tried to start a diesel engine on a 
cold day, you know that gas is by far easier to 
start. Diesels don't have spark plugs like gas engines
do, as the fuel is ignited once it's injected into
the cylinder that is already under pressure.  
When it gets cold, the air isn't hot enough to 
ignite the diesel fuel.  

Maintenance
Maintenance on a diesel vehicle is more expensive,
thanks to many things including the larger volume
of oil in the engine and the fact that fuel filters
and water separators must be serviced more often
than gas vehicles.  Gasoline engines have a bigger
advantage due to extended service periods on spark
plugs, engine oil, and even antifreeze.

Making that final choice between gas and diesel comes
down to what you'll do with your vehicle and where
you live.  If you use your vehicle for quick, fast
acceleration and rarely ever haul heavy loads, and
don't plan to keep your vehicle past 100,000 miles,
you may want to consider buying a gasoline vehicle.

Gas runs smoother, fuel is easier to find, and 
they are easier to start in cold weather.  On the 
other hand, if you plan to tow, value good fuel
economy and plan on racking up a lot of miles, then
you'll want to buy a diesel.

Price is also an important consideration, as diesel
vehicles can be a bit more expensive than gas.  If
you aren't worried about price, then diesel may be
your best bet.  For trucks, diesel is by far the
superior choice for those who like to haul heavy
loads on a frequent basis.
