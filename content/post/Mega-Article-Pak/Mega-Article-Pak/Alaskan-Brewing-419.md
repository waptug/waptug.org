Alaskan Brewing

The Alaskan brewing company is the oldest operating
brewery in Alaska, with their amber beer being 
their most popular brand.  They produce two other
brands as well, pale ale and Alaskan frontier
amber.  If you enjoy fresh amber beer, Alaskan
brewing is what you want.

As you may already know, brewing beer in Alaska is
very hard to do.  The coastal community of Juneau
doesn't have road connections to the lower 48 states,
so everything arrives and leaves by water or air,
with weather always having the final say.

In 1986, the Alaskan brewing company became the 
67th brewery to operate in the United States and
the only one to operate in Alaska.  Since that time,
Alaskan brewery has received more than 30 major
medals and awards, including the best beer in the
nation award during the 1988 Great American Beer
Festival.

The popularity of their beers has led to a great
amount of efforts to keep up with the demand from
consumers.  They also hold the unnofficial record
for the production on a 10 barrel brewing system,
which produces an amazing 42 batches a week.

The Alaskan Brewery offers several different styles
of brew as well, which are listed below:

	1.  Amber - This is the company's flagship
beer, based on a turn of the century recipe that
was used to quench the thirst of the miners during
the Gold Rush era.  It provides a smooth, malty,
rich taste that goes well with meals - or friends.
	2.  Pale - Pale is fresh, crips, and 
inviting.  Alaskan pale is great with crab, pawns,
and salads.  The floral aroma of the hops is 
derived from dry hopping the tanks during the entire
fermentation process.
	3.  Stout - The oatmeal style beer of stout
doesn't have the harshness of other stouts.  Great
with chocolate and hearty meals, stout is also 
ideal to enjoy while walking in the snow.
	4.  ESB - If you like hops, the infusion
of hops in this delight will amaze your nose while
the refreshing cascade hops will provide a wonderful
crispness to both the flavor and the finish.  This
beer is great with spicy food, wild game, and other
wintery food.
	5.  Smoked porter - Very exclusive, Alaskan
smoked porter has a world class reputation for its
excellence.  Brewed in the fall, this beer is ideal
for storing in the cellar for later enjoyment.
	6.  Winter ale - This tender brew of spruce
trees has been used for brewing in Alaska since 
the late 1700s.
