Basic Firearm Safety For Hunters

Every year, hundreds of hunting accidents occur across America; just ask Vice President Cheyney.  Many of these accidents could have been avoided by practicing a few basic gun safety techniques.

Know your weapon

If your weapon came with an owner’s manual, read it from cover to cover.  Practice taking apart your weapon and inspecting it thoroughly.  If you know what your weapon looks like normally, you will be quick to recognize any abnormalities of the weapon in the field.  If you drop your weapon or fall while carrying it, take it apart and inspect it for damage.  Make sure that the slide operates smoothly.  If you are in doubt about the integrity of your rifle, don’t fire it.

Educate yourself about the ammunition that you choose to use.  A .22 caliber bullet fired from a rifle can travel over two and a half miles.  This knowledge is necessary to line up a safe shot.

Transporting the weapon

Always keep your weapon unloaded until you are ready to fire.  If you are going to hike to a new location, unload  before starting out.  Store the rifle and ammunition separately and, if possible, keep the storage container locked.  Never carry a loaded rifle in your vehicle or on an ATV.

Sighting your prey

When sighting up your intended shot, there are many things to consider before pulling the trigger.   Never shoot at a partially obscured target.  Identify your prey fully before even raising your weapon to take a shot.  If you are in doubt about what is moving, control your excitement and wait until the target can be fully visualized.  Never hunt after dusk or before daybreak. 

Know what is in front of and behind your target before shooting.  Do not shoot animals that appear on hilltops and near the tops of ridges as you cannot identify what may be behind your target. If your game is near water, rocks, or buildings, keep in mind that bullets can ricochet off hard surfaces.  Do not use the gun’s scope to sight your game. Use your binoculars first, and then if the shot is clear, switch to the scope.

Treat your weapon as if it is loaded at all times

Never look down the barrel of a weapon for any reason.  Keep your muzzle pointed away from yourself and others at all times.  Learn and use various safe carrying positions for transporting your rifle in the field.

Keep a clear head

Never go hunting or handle a weapon if you have had any alcohol or medication that may impair your judgment.  Even a sleeping pill the night before can affect your reflexes during the day.
Get plenty of rest the night before your trip and go home early if you find yourself becoming drowsy.

Sighting a big buck or a fat bird can be exciting.  It’s important to keep a level head at all times and not let your emotions cloud your judgment.  Don’t allow yourself to act without thinking through the action to determine if it’s safe first.

Wear your safety gear

Bring along hearing and eye protection and wear them before shooting.  Include safety orange in your choice of head gear and upper body clothing.  This helps other hunters in the area distinguish you from the prey.
