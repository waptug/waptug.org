Celebrate Birthdays At Disneyland

If you want to celebrate your birthday, or the birthday 
of a child at Disneyland, you can easily do this – and 
it doesn’t even have to be done on the exact date of 
birth! Start celebrating by going to City Hall, which is 
located in Town Square, upon your arrival to 
Disneyland. Here, you will receive a Birthday Sticker 
or button. This sticker tells everyone on at Disneyland 
that you are to receive special treatment.

On your birthday celebration day, make sure that 
you eat in one of the full service restaurants, and that 
you order the Birthday Bucket. It will be full of 
Disney treats, and it includes a cake. This costs 
around twenty dollars. Eat breakfast at Goofy’s 
Kitchen and you can get a Birthday Bag for five 
dollars. 

There are many ways to enjoy your birthday at 
Disneyland. You will receive special treatment from 
all of the Disney Characters in the park. This can be
a memorable birthday celebration for you or your 
child – so make sure you take lots of pictures, and 
don’t be shy about telling people who work at the 
park that it is your birthday – if they don’t notice 
your sticker!
