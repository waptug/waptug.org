Universal Studios Tours – Incredible Rides

If you are looking for fun, thrills, and adventure, 
Universal Studios is the place to go. There are rides 
that will thrill you and rides that will scare you 
senseless. From caves to the air, there is something 
to please all of the thrill seekers out there.

Start your day with Revenge of the Mummy. This is 
a psychological thrill ride that is unlike anything you 
have ever experienced. This is a roller coaster ride in 
total darkness. Traveling at a very high speed, you 
will have many terrifying creatures jumping out at you. 
If your heart is still beating and you think you can 
handle more, your next stop should be Jurassic Park: 
The Ride. 

Jurassic Park may seem a bit tame after Revenge 
of the Mummy, but it is still great fun, and there are 
still many thrills. This ride entails you riding a raft 
which is slowly being cranked up. Dinosaurs of 
various breeds appear out of nowhere while you are 
going up. Suddenly, you and your raft are falling 
quickly downhill, and the ride ends with a huge 
splash that leaves you soaked! Make sure you 
bring a change of clothes, because you will want 
to move on to Back to the Future.

Back to the Future will have you riding in a car like 
the one on the movie. The scenes from the movie 
literally come to life, and many people experience 
motion sickness…so if you are prone to motion 
sickness, you may want to skip this one. Other 
attractions not to miss if you enjoy thrills include 
Nickelodeon Blast Zone, Van Helsing: Fortress 
Dracula, the Special Effects Stages, and Shrek 4-D.

If you get scared easily, you may want to avoid these 
thrill rides and attractions. They are also not 
recommended for very young children, pregnant 
women, or people with heart conditions. People with 
anxiety issues should avoid these attractions as well. 
There are many tamer rides and attractions that can 
be enjoyed in the park if the thrill seeking rides aren’t 
suitable for you.

The purpose of going to the park is to have fun. If the 
thrill rides and attractions scare you to the point 
where it isn’t fun anymore, than they should be 
avoided. Don’t allow others in your party to coerce you
into visiting the attractions that scare you too badly. 
Again, there are many attractions at Universal Studios 
Tours that are suitable for those who aren’t comfortable 
with the thrill seeking rides – so don’t think that you
can’t have a good time without getting scared 
senseless!
