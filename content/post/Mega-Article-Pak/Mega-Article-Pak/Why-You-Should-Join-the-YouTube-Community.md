Why You Should Join the YouTube Community

Do you enjoy visiting YouTube? Whether you are interested in watching fun and entertaining movies for free or if you like making your own movies to share with other internet users, YouTube is the place for you. What is nice about YouTube is they are not only a video sharing website.  With an online community section, YouTube, in a way, can also be considered a social networking site.

When it comes to visiting the YouTube community section, there are a large number of YouTube site visitors who wonder why they should do so.  If you are one of those individuals, this is quite a normal feeling. As internet security has become a major concern, there are many individuals who are nervous about interacting with others on the internet.  When using YouTube, namely the community section, you are advised to display caution, but you should be more than safe; in fact, you will likely have a good time.

The YouTube community works by making a few groups.  For instance, one of the many groups found on YouTube is funny videos.  If you have a funny video, you can request to have it displayed in the funny video group.  If you are just a viewer, you may also be able to request to have some of your favorite videos in a certain YouTube community group, whether it is the funny video group or not.  Not only will joining the YouTube community give you easy access to a number of videos that you are sure to like, it also gives you the opportunity to start discussions with other YouTube members, namely those who are participating in or enjoy visiting the same group.

If you are interested in joining a YouTube community group, you will need to click on the “Community,” tab, which can be found at the top of the YouTube webpage. There, you will be able to choose from a long list of YouTube community groups.  As it was previously mentioned, funny videos is one of those groups.  Under all of the videos that have been added to the group, you will see a discussions section.  In a way, this section is like an online message board. There, you can post your own messages or you can respond to other messages left by other YouTube community group members.  Joining a YouTube community group is nice because it automatically pairs you up with other internet users who enjoy the same interests, at least entertainment wise, as you.

In addition to joining the YouTube community groups, if you are also interested in interacting with other YouTube members, you may want to think about visiting the TestTube section of YouTube.  You can access TestTube by clicking the “TestTube,” link, which is in small print at the bottom of each YouTube page.  Right now, YouTube is working on a program, which you can try out, that lets internet users who are viewing the same videos discuss that video. In a way, this acts as if it is an online message board, but also an online chat room.  While this feature is still in the experimental stages, it is sure to quickly become a YouTube hit.

As outlined above, YouTube isn’t just about watching and sharing videos. You can also join in on discussions that are currently taking place on the site.  If you aren’t already doing so, you may want to look into it, as it only adds to the fun and excitement of YouTube.
