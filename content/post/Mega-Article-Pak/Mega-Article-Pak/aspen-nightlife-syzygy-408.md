Aspen Nightlife – Syzygy

Syzygy, which is located on East Hyman Avenue in 
Aspen, Colorado, has repeatedly won awards for 
being one of the best restaurants in this ski town. 
Featuring outstanding jazz music and food that is 
out of this world, Syzygy is the place to be when it 
comes to Aspen nightlife and fine dining. This is an 
Aspen landmark that is not to be missed.

The chef at Syzygy combines European and Asian 
dishes, and presents them in a modern American 
way. These combinations are what set the cuisine 
at Syzygy apart from the food you find at most 
restaurants. Along with this outstanding fare, you 
can select wine from a list of over 300 Italian, 
American, and French wines. If you aren’t sure 
which wine will work with the fine food you have 
ordered – simply ask your waiter. They always 
seem to know exactly which wine will enhance the 
flavor of the food the best.

One of the nice touches about the service at 
Syzygy’s is that the Chef likes to send gifts to the 
table, such as goat cheese, potato crisps, and 
osemary bread. Syzygy is famous for their 
atmosphere as well. The glass enclosed waterfalls 
inside the restaurant are talked about all over the 
world – and they are really something to see! Every 
part of the interior of this Aspen landmark works 
well together to create a mood that makes the 
food, the wine, the music, and the company 
absolutely enjoyable. 

You may be overwhelmed with all of the wonderful 
menu choices, and all of the delicious smells 
coming from nearby tables. You may not be able to 
make a choice! Syzygy’s has you covered. Simply 
order the Tasting Menu, and sample everything. 
Enjoy the music while you are eating – and after 
your meal as well. Some of the finest jazz artists in 
the world have performed at Syzygy’s. Call ahead 
to find out who will be performing – you will be glad 
that you did.

Syzygy’s is closed on Monday’s and Tuesdays 
during the off-season. During the season, they are 
open from 6pm to 10pm each day, and you should 
definitely call ahead for a reservation. Remember, 
this is an integral part of experiencing Aspen 
nightlife, so make sure you get by Syzygy’s at 
least once while you are in Aspen – the chances 
are very good that your first visit will not be your 
last! If possible, try to make it to the Sunday Jazz 
Brunch.
