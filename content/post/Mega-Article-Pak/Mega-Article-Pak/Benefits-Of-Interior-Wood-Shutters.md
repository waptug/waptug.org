Benefits Of Interior Wood Shutters

Interior wooden shutters will create the defining
touch to flatter any decoration of your home.  Wood
shutters are a great investment, and should be 
thought of and treated as fine furniture.  Also, 
they are the only window coverings that are actually
appraised into the value of your home.  The rich
natural appearance and matching quality features 
they offer make them a perfect choice for your home.

Insulation
Wood shutters will offer you many insulation values
such as energy efficiency, and they maintain interior
temperature from exterior temperature extremes as 
well as help with outside noise.  According to 
experts, it takes nearly 6 inches of brick, 14 inches
of concrete, and well over 1,700 inches of aluminum
to equal the insulating value offered by only 1 inch
of wood.

Environmental
Opposed to aluminum, plastic, and other types of
composites, wood is only material for shutters that
is manufactured from a 100% renewal source.

Authentic
Wood can be made from several sources, including 
poplar, oak, and basswood.  There are several products
that feature word wood in their name, although 
they actually contain little to no wood at all.
They are all extremely limited in their custom
features, and are only available in standard white
colors, cannot be stained, and they have both the
look and feel of plastic.

the most popular sources of shutters.  Wood shutters
offer you many features, and they are also easy to
install, even if you have no experience with installing
shutters.

You can find them in your local hardware store, or
even order them online if you prefer.  They may cost
a bit more than vinyl or other types of shutters,
although they will last for a long time and give 
your home the look you desire.
