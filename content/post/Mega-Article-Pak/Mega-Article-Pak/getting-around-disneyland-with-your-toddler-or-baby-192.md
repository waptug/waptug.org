Getting Around Disneyland with Your Toddler or 
Baby

As a parent, you already know that you don’t want 
to have to carry your child around in your arms all 
day. You couldn’t possibly make it through the day! 
You also can’t expect your child to walk all day long. 
The obvious choice is to have a way to transport your 
child – without wearing you or the child completely 
out.

Strollers are not only welcome at Disneyland, they 
are highly recommended. In fact, Disneyland rents 
strollers for a reasonable fee. Strollers can be rented 
for less than $10 for the day, and you can get a huge 
discount on a second stroller if it is needed. The 
strollers are clean and well-maintained, but they do 
all look alike. Tie something on the stroller, such as 
a brightly colored ribbon, to help identify it from all 
of the other strollers in the park.

Never leave your child unattended in the stroller, and 
never leave any material items of any value in the 
stroller either. Even if you bring your own stroller, 
you should have some easy way to identify it – there 
will be other strollers that look just like it at 
Disneyland.
