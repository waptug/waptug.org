In Ground Pools

Although above ground swimming pools may be cheaper to buy, easier to install, and cheaper to operate, a lot of people prefer to have in ground pools.  In groung swimming pools provide you with a lot more room to swim, and a lot more space.  Those of you who have families or a lot of friends who love to swim, would greatly benefit from having one of these pools.

In ground swimming pools are long lasting, as they are designed with cement on the sides and along the bottom.  They are a bit more expensive than above ground swimming pools, although they are more than worth the money you spend.  Depending on your needs, you can have your in ground pool built to your liking, such as a shallow end for kids and a deep end for diving.

Installing an in ground swimming pool will take a bit more time than above ground pools, which only take a few hours.  To install an in ground pool, the contractor will need to dig a hole in the ground, then set up the framework outside of the hole.  Once this is finished, he will pour some sand in the bottom of the this hole, then set the liner up.  

With in ground pools, you’ll have a few different types of material that you can select for the liner.  The most common and preferred is vinyl, which is also the most attractive.  Vinyl liners are also better for winter as well.  If you live in an area that is well known for winter, you may want to go with a vinyl liner for your swimming pool.

Fiberglass and concrete are also excellent liners as well.  Fiberglass liners are constructed in a factory from fiberglass reinforced plastic then worked with until it resembles a really large bathtub.  Unlike vinyl liners, you won’t need to replace fiberglass.  In the end, you can save a lot of money and time by using a fiberglass liner.

Concrete liners are also great, and are one of the most common ways to line your in ground swimming pool.  If you are using concrete, you can also have your pool custom poured, giving you the design you want.  Concrete lasts for years and years, and like fiberglass liners, it doesn’t need to be replaced.  You can also add to the look of this liner as well, by using tile or finishing the concrete liner with plaster.

In ground swimming pools are great for families who love to swim, or those who want to have the biggest swim pool possible.  Even though they take a lot of time to build and cost a lot of money, they are more than worth it in the end - when you walk outside and see what you have with your own eyes.
