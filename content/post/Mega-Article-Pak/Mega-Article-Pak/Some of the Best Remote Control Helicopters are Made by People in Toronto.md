Some of the Best Remote Control Helicopters are Made by People in Toronto

This may seem counterintuitive, but sometimes the best place to get remote control helicopters is not in the Unites States where there are the most helicopter enthusiasts, but rather in Toronto, where there are a lot, but not nearly as many, people actually interested in flying them.  The reason for this is because the people in Toronto have amazing skills at helicopter creation, and they are the most innovative group of people you will probably ever find when it comes to ability to make really beautiful helicopters.

I was so impressed by the helicopters I saw advertised in Toronto that I drove to Canada from Texas to purchase some for myself.  Normally, I would advocate doing an online order, but in this case, it was really better to just go there on my own, because the online inventory was much less impressive, plus the cost of shipping was outrageous.  Anyway, I took the time and drove to Toronto and used that little vacation to make a special trip to Niagara Falls as well, because I just cannot go to Canada without getting a glimpse of the Falls.

Anyway, it was so wonderful to see a bona fide helicopter shop where you knew the owners were also the manufacturers and they would know everything there was to know about helicopters.  And of course, the wonderful Canadian hospitality cannot be beaten, and the people selling remote control helicopters in Toronto and in surrounding areas are always happy to help with your purchase and to lend their knowledge to people who are new to the helicopter world and just want to learn as much as possible before they go forward with their first helicopter purchase.  Although I already consider myself a helicopter aficionado, I still know that I have a lot more to learn, and I am always interested in hearing as much as possible from these helicopter gurus.  It turns out that the day I got there they had just gotten a brand new shipment of their best brands and I got first dibs at looking at what they had to sell.

I was so thrilled with their selection and their true attention to detail, that I bought two remote control helicopters, even though I had initially planned to only buy one.  I brought the helicopters home and can happily say that I got back to the United States with a better knowledge of the newest trends in helicopter purchasing as well as a great idea of the type of warranty I could get in Canada.  It turns out that Toronto has a great warranty plan for their remote control helicopters; one that the United States has not yet been able to match.

And the thing I like best about buying remote control helicopters in Canada is the unassuming elegance of the helicopters these Canadians craft—perfect reflections of these people as a nation.  I still regularly use the two helicopters I purchased there, and I am looking forward to the next helicopter racing competition, when I can really see how well they handle.
