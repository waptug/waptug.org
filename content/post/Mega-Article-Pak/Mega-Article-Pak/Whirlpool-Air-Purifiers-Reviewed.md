Whirlpool Air Purifiers:  Reviewed

If you are a homeowner, there is a good chance that you have heard of Whirlpool before. Whirlpool is a well-known and well-trusted company. They make and sell a wide variety of different products. These products include, but are not limited to, ovens, dishwashers, washers, dryers, refrigerators, and air conditioners.  In addition to the previously mentioned items, Whirlpool also makes and sells air purifiers. If you are in the market for a new air purifier, whether that air purifier is for your home or for your office, you are advised to examine what Whirlpool air purifiers can do for you.

Whirlpool currently has two different types of air purifiers available for sale. These air purifiers include the Whispure True HEPA Air Purifier and the Whirlpool Air Purifier.  Each of the air purifiers are great for those who are looking to clean up the air inside their home or their office. Both air purifiers are considered well performing, due to their use of HEPA filters. It has been noted that HEPA filters are the best type of filters for air purifiers.  

With the Whirlpool Whispure True HEPA Air Purifier, you are not only getting a top of the line air purifier, but you are also getting an air purifier that is considered energy efficient. In fact, the Whirlpool Whispure True HEPA Air Purifier is considered an Energy Star product. Another reason why you may love this air purifier is because it has a sleep mode, as well as a change filter indicator.  It is also important to note that the Whirlpool Whispure True HEPA Air Purifier is qualified to clean the air in rooms with up to 510 square feet.

The Whirlpool Whispure True HEPA Air Purifier tends to cost a little bit more than most air purifiers. Despite the cost, which typically ranges around $300, you need to remember one thing. The air purifier is designed to clean the air in rooms up to 510 square feet. Most of the low-costing air purifiers can only clean the air of rooms with 200 to 300 square feet. In addition to the original purchase price of the Whirlpool Whispure True HEPA Air Purifier, you also need to consider the cost of the replacement filters. These replacement filters cost around $100; however, replacement filters are only needed about once a year.

The other air purifier developed and sold by Whirlpool is often referred to as the traditional Whirlpool Air Purifier. Despite sometimes being referred to as traditional, this air purifier is just as effective as the one mentioned above.  In reality, the only difference between the two is the amount of space that it covers. Instead of covering 510 square feet, like the above mentioned Whispure True HEPA Air Purifier, this model is only effective at cleaning the air in spaces that are up to 250 square feet. That is why you will find that the cost is a little bit lower.  

The cost of the Whirlpool Air Purifier, which is also considered an Energy Star product, is around $200.  In addition to the originally cost of purchase, you also need to examine the cost of replacement filters. These replacement filters cost around $100 each. Replacement filters need to be replaced whenever the replacement filter light is activated, which tends to be about once every year.

In addition to all of the features mentioned above, Whirlpool air purifiers, including the Whispure True HEPA Air Purifier, as well as the traditional Whirlpool Air Purifier, are known as being extremely quiet. In fact, you might even say that they are silent. Whirlpool stands behind the quietness of their air purifiers, so much that they offer a 30 day money back guarantee. That guarantee states that if their air purifier isn’t as quiet as the air purifier that you are replacing, they will take the product back and return your money.  

If you would like more information on the above mentioned Whirlpool air purifiers, you are urged to visit the online website of Whirlpool. That online website can be found by visiting www.whirlpool.com.
