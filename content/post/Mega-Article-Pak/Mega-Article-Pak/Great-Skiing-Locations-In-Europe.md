Great European Skiing Destinations

When it comes to skiing and winter sports, Europe has more than its fair share of amazing resorts.  From the greatly priced, to the more than reasonable, Europe has it all, and has so much to offer any skier.  If you’ve never been to Europe on a skiing holiday, or if you’re looking to expand your experience, you’ll find something that catches your eye without too much research, and you might just end up joining the legions of skiing fans that wouldn’t go anywhere else in the world for their vacation.

On mainland Europe, you have such a varied selection.  From the world famous French skiing resorts to Austria, Switzerland and the tiny principality of Andorra, you’ve got such a wide range of skiing to choose from.  France is known the world over as the true home of skiing, and the French really know how to do a quality vacation.  With naturally amazing resources, and scenery that can take your breath away, France is an ideal location for a skiing trip.  Why not try the Courchevel resort, which has four different ski resorts within one, providing the perfect blend of quality and affordability in a skiing trip.  From the grossly overpriced 1850 resort, the playground of Europe’s film stars and playboys, to the seemingly remote 1350 at the bottom of the hill, you have so much to choose from in Europe’s finest skiing country.  With the kids or with your friends, France is truly a destination that will make for a memorable skiing vacation.

Or how about some of the Italian resorts?  Italy, famous for being the cheaper way to ski, also benefits from a diverse range of resorts, like the tiny Alba resort, as well as some larger, more sizeable areas to ski.  Famous for passion and a depth of culture, Italy is the ideal place to take a skiing break in Europe, and the weather’s good too!  Or how about Italy’s neighbor, Croatia?  A rising European nation, you’ll find a Croatian holiday outrageously good value for money, not to mention top quality.  From the international standard ski resorts to their world class restaurants, Croatia is certainly a country on the up, and its skiing facilities can only improve as more and more tourists flock to their slopes each year.  Additionally, Bulgaria is an excellent skiing destination to take the kids.  With open arms, you will be welcomed by the Bulgarian people, who are more than eager to tell you about their rich and deep past, and welcome you as part of their future.  In these expanding and developing European nations, you will come to appreciate the value of tourism, and the quality of treatment and service they are prepared to offer for your investment.

How about Austria for your skiing trip?  When we think of skiing, we often imagine the Alpine ideal, with breathtaking scenery and fresh, clean air.  Well, it simply doesn’t come much better than Austria, and if you’re looking for a skiing destination that has it all, why not try Austria for that touch of class with your skiing.  Or why not pop over to Switzerland for their Alps experience?  Skiing the alps in the home of chocolate and cuckoo clocks, you will be amazed at how picturesque this modern nation has managed to be, whilst still becoming a world leader in financial industry.

Skiing in Europe is the ideal way to spend your vacation.  If you love skiing, you are guaranteed to find a great resort somewhere, within your budget that meets your needs, and caters for your ability.  With most resorts also boasting strong training academies, you can also work to improve your skills while you are there, ensuring that your skiing trip is both useful and memorable.  Whatever you are looking for, choose Europe as your number one skiing destination, for that perfect blend of quality, tradition and culture, and for a holiday that is truly breathtaking.
