Diesel Vehicles

As you probably already know, diesel engines get
better fuel economy than gas, simply because they
don't need to burn as much fuel as gasoline engines
to get the same amount of power.  Diesel engines
are built heavier than gas engines, to help sustain
the added stress of the much higher compression
ratios.

Diesel engines don't have an ignition system either,
so you'll never have to tune them up.  The exhaust
systems will last longer as well, as the exhaust
on a diesel isn't as corrosive as an exhaust on a 
gasoline engine.

With diesel engines, it isn't unusual to see them
with 400,000 or even 500,000 miles.  There are some
out there that have even went beyond 600,000 miles!

When it comes to maintenance, 3,000 mile oil changes
are a must.  Diesel fuel isn't as refined as gas,
so the oil will get dirtier faster.  You should
also replace the air and fuel filters at least
once a year.  

If you live in a colder climate, you'll need to 
switch to a winter blend of fuel to prevent fuel
gelling.  There are several additives that you can
put in the fuel as well, to help prevent your fuel
from getting gel.

It's also recommended that you replace the glow
plugs every two years.  If the temperature drops
below 10 degrees, a block heater is something you
should have.  This will ensure starting in cold
weather, especially with the heavy grade of oil
that a diesel engine requires.

If you take care of your diesel vehicle, you can
count on it to be around for years to come.  Unlike
gas vehicles, diesel engines are built for the
long haul, and will last you for miles and miles
if you take care of them.
