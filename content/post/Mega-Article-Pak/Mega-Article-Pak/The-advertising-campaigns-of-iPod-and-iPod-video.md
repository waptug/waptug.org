The advertising campaigns of iPod and iPod video

	
The ipod presents, besides an interesting technical evolution, an original and innovative way of promoting and advertising, which differs in style and slogans from the first ads of the first generation of iPods, to the most recent iPod video advertising campaigns. 
	
The first campaigns concentrated upon the new product promoted both the iPod and iTunes brands. These advertising campaigns were leaded by the slogan A thousand songs, in your pocket, which was launched in November 2001. The colors which were selected for the first iPod campaigns were brisk and full of live: turquoise, cyclamen, bright grass green and other joyful nuances were chosen to represent the idea of both music and video, meaning both visual and auditory sensations. The wrap advertising was used, at the same time with the other and more traditional types of BTL advertising: there were various light rail wraps in busy centers or midtowns, using the same visual message as the banners. Large banners and billboards were displayed in various busy centers, with high visibility. The promotion was intense, forward and dynamic, with only intense and optimum quality for all the elements: the colors were vivid, the actual ads were large and the represented images were dynamic. The TV ads were concentrated upon the idea of music, dancing and mobility and the text of these was just limited to the slogan of the product and of the Apple brand (Think clear).
	
In 2003, the new advertising campaign that Apple introduced was due to the conjunction with the launch of the iTunes music store. The campaign concentrated mostly on the interpretation of popular songs by different persons wearing iPods. This campaign was a big hit, due to the fact that it was based on famous pop, rock and hip hop songs, belonging to artists such as Eminem or Pink. 
	
Later that year, in October 2003, iPod released a new series of ads, based on the silhouette campaign, which was the base for most of the print ads, like banners, billboards and wraps, even from the appearance of the first generation of iPods: the images basically showed black silhouettes of people dancing while wearing iPods. This new campaign was realized based on the same intense colors and dynamic images like the first campaign. Even more, the success of the campaign was owed to the popularity of the performed music, such as The Vines' Ride, The Caesars' Jerk it Out, Gorillaz' Feel Good Inc., Steriogram's Walkie-Talkie Man, Jet's Are You Gonna Be My Girl, Propellerheads' Take California, Ozomatli's Saturday Night, N*E*R*D's Rock Star (Jason Nevin's Mix), Franz Ferdinand's Take Me Out or Daft Punk's Technologic.
	
With the release of the new iPod video, the image of the product and its promotion began to change. The slogan of the new product was One more thing..., meaning the new and expected video feature, which was a big plus comparing with the latest model of 2005. The ads for this new product were focused on the video playing capabilities of the device. Actually, the ad featured U2's Original of the Species from the Vertigo: Live From Chicago DVD. Based on the same idea, there were 2 more videos which featured Eminem and Wynton Marsalis. Still, at the same time, the ad which was presenting the dancing silhouettes continued, but it was modified into something more representative for the new video device: the backgrounds were not simple vivid colors anymore, they were textured and had various patterns, symbolizing the evolution concerning the image and the video properties of the new model of iPod. The 2 variants of the videos featuring the 2 popular artists ranged from an orange urban theme of the hip hop music to a cool blue one of the jazz look. 
	
The latest iPod ad, released in March 2006 is not based on the silhouette style anymore; instead, the producers opted for a video showing various CD covers, integrating in an iPod nano, under the same older slogan A thousand songs, in your pocket.
