Facts About Nutrition Labels

The nutrition label located on each and every food item, 
will tell you all the information about that food.  For
some however, this information isn't exactly that reader
friendly.  Fear not, as it's actually easier than you 
think.

Serving Size
This size is based on the amount people eat. Similar
food items will have similar serving sizes, thus making
it easier to compare 2 foods of the same category.

% Daily Value
This indicates how food will fit in a 2,000 calorie
diet.  This will help you to understand if the food
has a lot, or just a little of the important nutrients.

The middle section
The nutrients you'll find listed in the middle section
are the ones that are most important to your health.  
This information can help you to calculate your daily
limit of fat, fiber, sodium, and other nutrients.

Vitamins & minerals
The percent daily value found here is the exact same
as the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance for vitamins 
and minerals.  

Now that you know what the nutrition label actually 
means, it'll be a lot easy to eat healthy.  Eating 
healthy is a great thing - especially when you use the
nutrition label to assist you with your food choices.
