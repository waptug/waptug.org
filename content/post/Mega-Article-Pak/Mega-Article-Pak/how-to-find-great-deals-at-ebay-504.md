How to Find Great Deals at eBay

Everyone loves a great deal! Many people spend 
quite a bit of time searching for good deals on the 
items that they want and need – and when they find 
those deals, they experience a certain amount of 
satisfaction. These people typically haunt garage 
sales, stores that are holding sales, wholesale 
warehouses, flea markets, and especially online 
and offline auctions. With the incredible number of 
auctions that are constantly going on at eBay, it 
can be difficult to find the items you want, at the 
price you want to pay. But it isn’t impossible to find 
great deals!

There are steps you can take to ensure that you are 
getting a great deal on the items you purchase 
through eBay. In fact, these same steps will also 
help to protect you against fraud. Participating in 
online auctions is a great deal of fun, but you must
use caution as well. This caution entails doing your 
research before you place any bids.

Start with the auction in question. Make sure that 
you read every word of the description and the 
auction details. You can never have too much 
information – especially if that information is 
about an individual that you may be doing business 
with. Pay special attention to what the description 
and auction details do not say. For instance, is a 
guarantee mentioned? Is the item new? Is it 
authentic? Is there proof of authenticity? Look for 
auctions that provide the right information – and 
the right amount of information. Avoid those that 
do not.

Who will pay the shipping and handling costs? Often,
the buyer pays these costs, and sometimes, the 
seller tries to charge more than the actual shipping 
and handling costs are. Beware of high shipping 
costs, especially for items that will be auctioned 
off at a very low price. Also note when the item is 
supposed to ship after the bidding has ended. 
Depending on what you are trying to purchase the 
item for, it may not arrive in time.

Don’t make the mistake of bidding on an item simply 
because it is a ‘good deal.’ It is only a good deal for 
you if the item is something that you really want or 
need. Many people simply bid for the sake of 
bidding – or winning – without having any real need 
or desire for the item in question. Before bidding on 
items that you do want or need, check prices 
around the Internet and the prices available from 
offline sources as well. Just because it is on eBay 
does not guarantee that it is the cheapest price 
available!

Finally, learn more about the seller. Can you trust 
them? What is their rating? Read their feedback 
page! Failure to learn more about the seller can be
costly. Not everyone is as honest as you are – and 
the seller may be trying to take advantage of people 
that simply don’t know enough to find out more 
about them. Sometimes scammers make their 
auctions sound like really great deals. Beware of 
prices that seem extremely low!
