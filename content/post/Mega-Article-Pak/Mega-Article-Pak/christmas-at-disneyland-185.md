Christmas at Disneyland

Christmas is one of the happiest times of the year 
for a child. Spending the happiest time of the year, 
at the happiest place on earth, could be a dream 
that comes true for many children and adults. 
Christmas at Disneyland is an experience that will 
never be forgotten, and can never be matched.

Disneyland works to make Christmas very special. 
Santa’s Reindeer Roundup is especially fun, allowing 
children to decorate Christmas cookies with Mrs. 
Clause, play Reindeer Games, and make holiday 
souvenirs. Between seeing all of the characters 
dressed up in their holiday costumes and enjoying 
the ‘snow’ after the Fireworks, Christmas at 
Disneyland cannot be topped!

Make sure that you visit the Christmas Shoppe and 
buy a special holiday ornament. Also, take part in 
all of the special holiday rides. Visiting Disneyland 
at Christmas time is unlike any other Disneyland 
vacation you will ever take. Make sure you get a 
picture of the Christmas tree!

Even though Christmas is considered to be 
‘off-season’ you should be prepared for crowds. 
Christmas is a very popular time to visit 
Disneyland. Make reservations well in advance.
