The Pros and Cons of Cordless Power Tools

The power tool industry has implemented the idea of cordless power tools in the past decade. They have been very popular. Consumers enjoy the convenience of being able to use them anywhere without having to worry about a power supply. It is also nice not have to worry about the cords being in your way, especially when an extension cord was needed to get it to the right length.

As most consumers are aware, convenience is always more expensive. You will find cordless power tools cost more than the traditional power tools with cords. A major drawback of cordless power tools is that they don’t offer as much power as a cord power tool. In many cases the difference in power isn’t enough to be an issue, but for larger projects it can be a major concern.

You always know a power tool with a cord is going to work when you need it. That isn’t always so with a cordless tool. I know on several occasions I have reached for my cordless screwdriver and found the charge completely dead because I didn’t charge it up. You will need to remember better than I do to recharge your cordless power tools. While you can easily recharge the batteries, some power tools have a battery that gets weaker over time. This means it won’t hold much of a charge. You can choose to purchase a replacement battery at that point.

There is less of a risk of accidents with a cordless power tool because you don’t have to worry about trips and falls due to the cords. You are also less likely to be shocked or electrocuted. One draw back is that with a cordless power tool someone else can’t simply unplug it if you are involved in an accident. Make sure any cordless power tool has an easily accessed on/off switch. 

To make the recharge issue less of an inconvenience, some larger power tools including drills and saws come with two batteries. This is great for keeping one in the power tool and the other charging. It is fast and easy to switch the two so you will always have a fully charged battery ready to work with. 

The decision to purchase a cordless power tool is a personal one. Some of us love the convenience of them, and we don’t mind paying extra for it. Most of us don’t miss the extra power either because we only use these power tools for home projects. Those who do large project on a regular basis prefer the heavy duty power tools with a cord. That is fine, that is why the market carries both. It allows consumers to make a choice based on what is going to work well for them. 

To make that decision, decide what you are looking for in a power tool. Where are you likely to use it? Is there a reliable power source in that location? How much power are you looking for? If it doesn’t matter than make the purchase based on the best price for the power tool you are looking for. You can easily compare the differences between a particular power tool model with a cord and without. You will have to decide if it is worth the expense for the convenience.
