Researching Auto Responders

If you are in the Internet marketing business or if you run a business online, an autoresponder can make a world of difference.  They can handle a majority of your technical support questions and informational requests, by sending out automated messages to interested customers.  When they get an email, they will respond instantly with a preset message.  This can save you quite a bit of time- especially if you get a lot of emails on a daily basis.

Out there on the Internet, there are many autoresponders to choose from.  They are classified into three main types – locally hosted, remote hosted and desktop hosted.  Each type has pros and cons, depending on your needs.  Locally and desktop hosted programs will give you complete control over the program, as you run them through your own server or website.  Remote hosted on the other hand, is ran through a third party service provider.  Remote programs cost you a monthly fee, while desktop and locally hosted programs cost one fee – then you have complete ownership of the program.

Before you decide to purchase an autoresponder, you should always compare and see what each one has to offer.  If you are interested in running one from your server or website, then you’ll need to look at desktop and locally hosted autoresponders.  There are free programs available online, although they will normally come with strings attached, such as ads in your emails.  This can be a bad thing, as ads in your email will give customers the wrong impression. www.Automatic-Responder.com is a great service that also offers a free version for up to 250 subscribers and no advertisements.

When you purchase one of these types of autoresponder programs, you should always research and find out all that you can.  There are many programs out there that you can buy, many of which will offer you great features at a great price.  Buying your program is the way to go, especially if you have an image to uphold.  Once you have found a program and buy it, it will be yours for as long as you decide to use it.

If you are looking towards a remotely hosted autoresponder, you’ll need to research for the best prices and service, this is a must when shopping around.  You’ll be dealing with a company who has control over the address of the autoresponder, meaning that your domain name won’t appear in the emails you send using the autoresponder.  This can be good for some, although many prefer to have their name in their emails.

When it all comes down to it, you should always research an autoresponder before you decide to make a purchase or use a free program.  There are several out there to choose from, although some are far superior to others.  If you take the time and research what each one has to offer you and how much it will cost you – you’ll end up with an autoresponder that will prove to be more than worth the cost.
