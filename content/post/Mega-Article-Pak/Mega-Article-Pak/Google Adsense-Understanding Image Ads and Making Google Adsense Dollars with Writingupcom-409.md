Google Adsense: Understanding Image Ads and Making Google Adsense Dollars with Writingup.com

What are image ads?

Image ads are graphical ads.  Unlike traditional banner ads, image ads are also targeted to the appropriate audience, just like text ads.  A publisher that has a combination of image ads and text ads has a greater revenue generating potential.  

Image ads are only for Adsense for Content pages and not available for Adsense for Search results pages.

There are 5 major formats of image ads.  The Leaderboard, which is about twice the size of a banner ad, the banner image ad, the skyscraper, the wide skyscraper and the medium rectangle. Google’s technology determines on a page by page basis whether image ads, text ads, or a combination of both will make you more money and then delivers the appropriate format.

You can choose to run only image ads, but Google recommends selecting both, thereby giving them a better chance to target the right advertising for your page, generating more revenue for you.

Bottom line: taking these two methods together will give you the best chance at making the most revenue.

How to Make Google Adsense Dollars at Writingup.com

To get started blogging at writingup.com, first you’ll need to create a Google Adsense account.  If you’ve already done that, you’ll just give them the same publisher id you got when you  originally signed up with Google Adsense.  Since you can only have one Google Adsense account, you will always use the same publisher id on every site you add.  Next, you’ll create an account at writingup.com and within minutes, start blogging!

You still have to follow the Google Adsense rules as to the type of content not acceptable but other than that you have carte blanche as to what to write about in your blog.  Paste your writingup.com URL into your email signature and every time you send someone an email, you will be referring them to your blog, thus increasing your traffic on writingup.com.  

Comment on other publisher’s blogs.  If you interact with the blogging community, you are more likely to have your blog read more often.  Again, traffic.

Writingup.com has a list of successful topics you can write about.  You don’t have to choose from that list of course, but it’s quite extensive and if you look it over, you’ll probably find something that interests you.  They are successful topics because they turn up in search engines a lot.  More traffic.
