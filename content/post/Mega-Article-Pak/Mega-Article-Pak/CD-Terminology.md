CD Terminology

Below, you'll find the most common terminology that
relates to CD duplication.  Even if you are new to
duplication, the terms below may help you learn more.

BLER
Block Error Rate.  This is the raw digital error rate
before any type of error correction.

CD
This the Compact Disc, a digital medium that's formed
of a 12cm polycarbonate substrate, a reflective
metalized layer, and a protective lacquer coating.

CD-R
Compact Disc-Recordable.  The term CD-R is used to
describe the technology of recordable CD along with
the equipment, software, and media that are used to
make the recordable disks.

Data layer
With CD-R media, this is the organic dye that is 
sandwiched between the polycarbonate substrate and
the metalized reflective layer of the media.  CD-R
disks don't have any data on them at all until the
are recorded. 

Injection Molding
This is a manufacturing method where the molten
material is forced into a mold, normally under
high pressure, then cooled so that the material
will take on the shape of a mirror image in the
mold.

Media or blanks
CD-R media are the disks that are used to record
digital information using a special recorder and
premastering software with a computer.  These discs
are made of a polycarbonate substrate, a layer of
organic dye, a metalized reflective layer, and a
coating of lacquer for protection.

Organic dye
The data layer of CD-R media is made from a dye
that is melted during the process of recording.
Where the dye is melted, becomes opaque or 
refractive, scattering the reading laser so that 
it isn't reflected back into the reading sensors.

Reflective layer
This is the  metal later that sits on top of the 
dye that reflects the laser beam back to the 
reading assembly.  This is normally 24k gold in
CD-R disks, although it can be silver as well.
