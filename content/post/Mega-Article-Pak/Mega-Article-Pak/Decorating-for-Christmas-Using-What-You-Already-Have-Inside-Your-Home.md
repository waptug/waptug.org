You can also use candleholders to create your own Christmas themed centerpieces.  In addition to table centerpieces, Christmas pictures and drawings are also commonly used as Christmas decorations.  If you have paper, colored pencils, markers, or even crayons inside your home, you could easily create you own Christmas pictures.
