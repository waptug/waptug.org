Vitamins That Help With Hair Growth

Loss of hair, or baldness, is the result of not having enough vitamin B supplements.  Vitamin B is very important, as it contains B3 niacin, which is very important for growing hair.  Vitamin B6 is another important vitamin, containing nutrients such as sulfur, biotin, magnesium, and zinc.  Without these vitamins, your body won’t be able to grow hair as much, which commonly results in balding or hair loss as we get older.

What many people fail to realize, is the importance of vitamin B.  Research has shown in the past that vitamin B is very important to hair growth.  Men who consume foods that are rich in vitamin B are less likely to experience hair loss.  Vitamin B is an essential vitamin, and also one that enriches the overall quality and thickness of hair.  

Vitamin A is also important with hair growth.  To get the proper amount of vitamin A, you should consume fatty acids.  Some examples include flaxseed oil, primrose, and salmon oil.  If you consume these types of fatty acids, you’ll get the right amount of vitamin A that is needed to enhance the growth of your hair.  If you are worried about hair loss, you should make sure that you are getting enough vitamin A and vitamin B.

Vitamin E is also important for hair growth, as it stimulates your intake of oxygen and helps to improve your blood circulation as well.  If your blood is circulating properly, then the growth of your hair will be enhanced.  The proper circulation of blood is very important with hair growth, as the blood is what helps your hair to grow, and the necessary vitamins to flow through your body.

Another necessary vitamin for hair growth is biotin.  You can find this essential source in rice, green peas, soybeans, oats, yeast, walnuts, and sunflower seeds.  It is also found with some types of shampoos as well.  If you are using shampoo that contains biotin, you’ll be getting into your root tips faster, which will help to promote the growth of your hair.  Even though you may be using shampoo that contains biotin, you’ll still need to take the necessary vitamins and supplements as well.

Before you take any vitamins or supplements, you should always consult with your doctor and get his opinion.  There may be some vitamins and supplements that you shouldn’t be taking, which is why you should always consult with your doctor before you make any decision.  Your doctor will be able to run tests and go through your history with you, letting you know what you can and can’t take.  This way, you can choose your vitamin supplements accordingly – and know without a doubt that there will be no long term side effects or problems.
