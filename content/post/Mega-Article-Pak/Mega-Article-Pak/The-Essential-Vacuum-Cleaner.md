The Essential Vacuum Cleaner

The vacuum cleaner is a truly amazing piece of
equipment, as it would be very hard to cope without
one.  There are many people out there who prefer 
domestic vacuum cleaners for carpeted floors in 
their home.

No matter how you look at it, the vacuum cleaner is
an ingenious piece of equipment.  It has an air 
pump that creates a partial vacuum to suck up the
dust and dirt, which it collects by a filtering
system or a cyclone to dispose of later.

Vacuum cleaner types
Based on their configurations, there are many types
of vacuum cleans.  The following are some of the
most known types of vacuum cleaners.

Bagless
Bagless vacuum cleaners, as the name implies, don't
use bags.  They collect the dust in a compartment
which you can quickly and easily empty.  This will
save you from the headache of dealing with messy
and frustrating vacuum bags.

Upright
Upright vacuum cleaners have the pump mounted
directly above the suction intake, with the bag
mounted on the handle that will normally rise to
waist height.  The designs of upright vacuum cleaners
will normally employ mechanical beaters, which 
are often rotating brushes, to help dust that has
yet to settle be vacuumed up.  An attached belt to
the vacuum motor will drive these beaters.

Canister types
Canister vacuum cleaners have the motor and the
bag in a separate cylinder unit that is connected
to the vacuum head by a long flexible hose. Even
though the upright units have been tested as being
more effective, the lighter and more maneuverable
heads of the canister are also popular.  There are
some canister models on the market that feature
power heads which contain the same type of beaters
as found with upright units, even though those
types of beaters are driven by a seperate electric
motor.

Backpack
Backpack vacuums are a great tool for commercial
type cleaning.  Backpack vacuums will allow you to
move around rapidly in a large area.  It is 
basically a canister vacuum cleaner, except for the
fact that the straps are used to carry the canister
unit on your back.

Central vacuum
A central or built in vacuum cleaner has the suction
motor and bag based in a central location of the 
building, providing vacuum inlets at strategic
places throughout the building.  This way, you only
need to carry the hose and pickup head from room
to room.  The hose is normally 25 foot long, 
allowing a large range of movement without having
to change vacuum inlets.

A plastic pipe will connect the vacuum outlets to
the central unit.  The head of the vacuum may 
either by un-powered or have beaters that are operated
by an air driven or electric motor.  The dirt bags
in central systems are so big that you only need
to change or empty them once or twice a year.

Robotic
Robot type vacuum cleaners will move around your 
home, cleaning as they wish.  They are compact and
powered by batteries.

Hand held
Hand held vacuum cleaners are very small and powered
by either batteries or electricity, and very popular
with cleaning up small spills.

Wet or dry vacs
Wet or dry vacuum systems can be used to clean up
both wet and dry spills and dirt.

Vacuums are very helpful with protecting yourself
and your family from dust particles.  They are also
helpful for those who suffer from allergies that
result from dirt and dust.  Before you buy a vacuum
cleaner, you should always read some reviews and
find out other information to ensure that the vacuum
cleaner you buy will meet your needs.
