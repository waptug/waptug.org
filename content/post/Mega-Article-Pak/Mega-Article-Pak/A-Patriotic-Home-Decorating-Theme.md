A Patriotic Home Decorating Theme

Are you hard core red, white, and blue? If so, then your country needs you to stand up and present your true colors to the world. This can be easily accomplished by celebrating everything American with your home decorating plans. Believe it or not patriotic is the thing to be in post 9-11 America and the way you decorate your home can let the world know exactly where your true convictions lie. 

There are many things you can do to bring Old Glory front and center within your home that do not require you to drape your furniture with the American flag or having the flag hanging in every window. In fact, most would frown on that particular practice. One thing that can be said without fail though is that nothing can change the overall impression a room gives as completely as a bucket of paint and a brush. In other words, the best place to begin is often with the walls of your home. Painting a backdrop of red and trimming with blue and white makes a bold and powerful statement. It's also a rather lovely statement if you choose the correct shades of red, white, and blue.

In addition to paint there are all kinds of country style décor that would compliment a patriotic theme quite nicely. From stars that are designed to hang on the wall to patchwork quilts in these patriotic shades and a quilt rack that can either stand against the wall or hang on the wall. Quilts are outstanding choices to bring colors into a room as well as an excellent method for adding warmth. In addition to many quilts there are also plenty of throws and blankets that can bring these colors front and center in almost any room of the home. 

In addition to walls, furniture can be painted in order to match the walls and other colors you'd like to incorporate into the room. There is nothing quite like walking into a home that has its full patriotic splendor shining for all the world to see. It's a beautiful thing made even more poignant now that the initial wave of patriotism following the September 11th attacks has faded somewhat. For those that are true patriots there are few better ways to show that than by making your home a testament of your patriotism. 

Candles are another great way to display your patriotic spirit. Red, white, and blue candles are made in many wonderful styles, sizes, and fragrances. You should be able to find something appropriate in this color combination if you look hard enough. More importantly, fragrance is a great (and often overlooked) way to add another dimension to your home decorating endeavors. If you want to truly make an impression burn apple pie scented candles on a regular basis so that your home almost always smells as American as apple pie. In addition to candles of course there are fragrance warmers, air sprays, and simmering pots in which this scent can be found (particularly if you prefer a scent layering affect in your home).

Whether you simply like the look of patriot blue or you feel that you are a true American through and through there are very few wrong reasons to incorporate the red, white, and blue that represents America into your home décor. Patriotism seems to be a dieing art once again; perhaps your bold statement can inspire others to do the same.
