eBay and Drop shipping – Getting the Product to 
Your Customer

If you hope to own an eBay business, and make a 
full time living at it, you can easily make that dream 
come true – even if you don’t have a product of your 
own to sell. eBay provides many people who want to 
quit their corporate nine-to-five jobs with a way to 
make a good living, without having to put up a lot of 
start up capital. This is made possible with the help 
of drop shippers. Drop shippers send merchandise to 
the customers of business owners. If you have an 
eBay business, you are a business owner. This will 
allow you to offer a wide variety of stock in your 
eBay store, without having the need to warehouse
all of those products! 

All you have to do is set up your auction, and sell 
the product. You then pass the customer’s 
information on to the drop shipping company. The 
drop shipper does the rest, and they will even use 
your company information, as well as your company 
logo if you have provided it to them. When the product 
arrives at your customer’s home, they will have no idea
 that your company didn’t send it. The drop shipper 
will package, label, and ship the products that you 
sell, allowing you more time to set up even more 
auctions, for greater profits.

You must establish a relationship with several drop 
shipping companies in order to become successful.
In the beginning, most companies will require you to 
pay for the items that your customers order before 
they are shipped. You need to fill orders in a 
timely manner, so you should pay for the items with 
a credit card for speedy service. Eventually, you will 
be able to have the drop shipper fill your orders, and 
then bill you for them later.

When you set up your eBay auctions, make sure 
that your reserve price is set higher than the price 
that the drop shipper will be charging you for the 
item. The idea, of course, is to earn a profit! 
Depending on the item you are selling, a markup 
of about 10% should be about right, but you should 
do some research to see if the item is selling for a 
lower price in another eBay auction, or through 
other online sources.

By starting an eBay business using the drop 
shipping method, there is essentially no financial risk
involved. The product will be sold before you pay the 
drop shipper for the item. This is one of the few 
businesses where you can actually turn a profit 
before you have expenditures!
