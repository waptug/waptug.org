Picking the Right Golf Club Shaft

If you are picking out some new golf clubs for your personal enjoyment, one of the biggest factors will be picking the right shaft. The shaft of a golf club is the metal that connects the handle to the head, and effectively holds the entire golf club together. It plays a huge role in the swing of the club. Picking the right one can have a huge effect on your whole game, but you have to consider many things when picking it. The best thing you can do is get a seasoned golfer to help you out in this matter, and try out enough golf clubs to feel confident in your choice. There are, however, a few guidelines that will always be helpful for someone picking out a golf club shaft. Pay attention to them, and you can make a wise choice when picking out your golf clubs.

The length of the shaft is definitely the factor that needs the most thought put into it. Since everyone’s swing techniques and height are different, the shaft you choose will have to be tailored personally to you. One way that people determine their desired length is to measure from their navel straight down to the floor. Once you grip the club and lean over to make your stroke, you will find that the length is almost always perfect. However, if you don’t lean as much as other people (or you lean further), the length will have to be altered. Just try out a few lengths before you decide on one, and you should end up being happy with the length of the golf clubs that you choose. However, that’s not all.

Golf club shafts also have another factor that is specified by the manufacturer, and this is the flex of the club. If you try to bend it with your bare hands you won’t notice it bending visibly, but when you swing your club it does bend in an almost imperceptible amount. This can largely affect your game, especially if you are used to using another type of club with a different amount of flex. The main thing that changes your choice of flex is the speed of your swing. Do you put all of your force and speed into a swing, or do you do it more delicately? The faster swings will probably be better off with a stiffer shaft. Club shops should be able to help you determine how much flex you need.

Most of these things can be altered by the material that the club is built out of. The two most popular materials are steel and graphite. Each one has its own unique characteristics – generally graphite is considered to be the more professional choice, but you may find that steel shafts work perfectly well for you. The steel shafts are heavier and more durable, and usually cheaper than graphite. However, graphite is perfect for those who prefer lighter clubs and higher torque ratings. The needs of a golfer can range across many different variables, but many find that their needs fall within the offerings of steel shafts.

Lots of golfers find that they are fine with simply sticking to the golf club shafts that they have learned on. However, if you are a dynamic golfer and you feel that you can improve your game by buying a shaft that is more suited to you, then you will find that it can increase your enjoyment of golf by quite a bit. The right shaft paired with the right person can work wonders. Therefore you should consider all of the factors that have been discussed here, and decide how you can use them to your benefit. With the help of expert golfers along with club store employees, you should be able to use the combined knowledge to pick out something great to replace your current clubs.
