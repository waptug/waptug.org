Making A Safe Room

The safe room, which is also known as a panic room, is a secure location within a home or building that is designed to provide safety for families during terrorist attacks, nature, burglaries, or other types of threats.  A safe room is an ideal investment for any home owner, although the more fortified rooms with heavy security are normally found in the homes of rich people.  Those that have a lot of money really have no budget - therefore they can easily spend thousands on making their safe room the best place to go in the event of an emergency.

For most of us, a safe room is a location that family members can run to and hide, or call for help in an emergency situation.  You don’t really need to go all out and put steel walls and a steel door in the room, although you do need a fortified door that opens outward with fortified walls.  You can have a door constructed of wood or other material, although the key should be a material that is very hard to break through.  No matter what type of door you choose, the doorjamb should be steel, to prevent the door from being kicked in.

It’s almost important that your safe room doesn’t contain any windows.  Windows can provide entry for burglars, which is something you obviously don’t want.  You should also make sure that you keep a phone in the room, along with water, first aid kits, food, and any type of defensive weapons that you can get.  It’s also a good idea to keep medical supplies in the safe room as well, just in case you need them.

No matter how hard you may try, it’s impossible to predict how long you will be locked in your safe room when an emergency happens.  Therefore, you should always think about ventilation, lighting, and even hygiene.  Being locked in a room for several days or possibly even weeks can affect your hygiene, which is why you should keep proper hygiene supplies in your room at all times.

The reason why most people invest in a safe room is burglars, as they present a real threat.  No matter where you live, or how nice the neighborhood may be, a burglary can happen at any given time.  When a burglary happens, the last thing you want to try to do is to reason with the burglars, or attempt to cooperate with them.

When you have a safe room, you can take your family there.  You should always make sure that everyone in your family knows where the safe room is located and how to use it.  If you have children, you should teach them about the room and how important it is.  The room should never be used for recreation purposes or for children to play in.  Instead, it should only be used in case of an emergency or a place for you and your family to hide.

If you have a safe room or just interested in one, you should always make sure that you keep the proper supplies on hand, just in case.  When you finally do use the safe room, you should always make sure that you keep the keys to open the room inside, so no one else can get in.  While you are in the room you can call the local authorities, then wait inside your safe room until they get to your house and the problem is solved.  Never, under any circumstances should you come out of your safe room before the police arrive.  If a burglary is taking place, you will only make the situation worse.
