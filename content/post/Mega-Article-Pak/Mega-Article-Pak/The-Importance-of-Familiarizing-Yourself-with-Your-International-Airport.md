The Importance of Familiarizing Yourself with Your International Airport

Are you planning on flying out of the country this year?  If so, have you even been on an international flight before?  If not, there is also a good chance that you have never been in an international airport before.  Even if you have visited an international airport before, is it the same one that you are planning on flying out of for your next trip?  If not, you are advised to fully research and examine the international airport that you will be using. You will find that are an unlimited number of benefits to doing so. 

Perhaps, the most important reason for familiarizing yourself with the international airport that you will be flying out of is so that you can know where you are going. Most international airports do not only house international airlines, but domestic airlines as well. For that reason, most international airports are fairly large in size. In fact, some are so large that they may seem overwhelming.  By taking the time to research and examine each airport facility, namely the airport terminals, you will know where to arrive, where to park, and where to wait.

If you are interested in familiarizing yourself with the layout of your international airport, you have a number of different options. Perhaps, the easiest way is to visit the online website of the international airport in question. If you don’t already know the address of that online website, you should be able to find it by performing a standard internet search. Once you have arrived at the airport’s webpage, you should be able to find a map of the airport. Some international airports have interactive maps, but almost all airports have maps that you could easily print off your computer, if you wish to do so.  

It is also advised that you examine all airport fees. These fees do not include the cost of your airline tickets, but the cost of using certain airline services or features. For instance, a large number of international airports, especially those large in size, have offsite parking. This means that the parking lots, which are often long-term lots, are not within a reasonable walking distance to the airport terminals. If this is the case, you will need to make different arrangements. Most international airports will offer shuttle rides to and from their airports, but not all are free. In the event that you will be charged for using a shuttle service, you are advised to determine that cost ahead of time.

Although you may be able to receive a free shuttle ride from the airport parking lot to your terminal, you will not be able to get food and souvenirs free of charge. Although it is impossible to determine the exact cost of your souvenir purchases or the cost of your food, you should be able to make a reasonable estimate. This estimate may be important, especially if you are traveling on a limited budget. By examining the shopping centers and restaurants that you will have access to, you should be able to decide how much or how little you would like to spend at the airport. 

You will also want to see if the international airport that you will be using has an estimated arrival time. Almost all airports request that you arrive at least two hours before your flight is scheduled to take off, but some international airports have other suggestions or advice for travelers. If you find that the airport recommends arriving three hours early, you are advised to arrive three hours early. This will help to ensure that you are able to make your international flight.  If a problem should arise and you miss your flight, it may be difficult to schedule another international flight right away; you may not only be required to wait a few hours, but a few days.

As you can easily see there are a number of different reasons why you should familiarize yourself with the international airport that you will be flying in and out of. With this research taking a maximum of a few hours, you are advised to do it; you are guaranteed to walk away better prepared.
