Choosing A Radio Controlled Plane

When you buy a radio controlled plane for the first time, you may have some difficulty choosing the plane that will introduce you to the remote controlled hobby. You will want something that will be fairly cheap to purchase, and will give you a chance to learn how to fly remote controlled planes before you move onto more advanced planes. If you buy the first plane that you see, you could end up having a very bad experience for your first time, and be completely turned away from the hobby. This is why it is very important to know that there are many different characteristics that you can look for. In this article I will go over most of them. So read on to find out about what you need to look for to have the best experience possible when you fly a radio controlled plane for the first time.

First you need to assess your own building skills. You can buy airplane kits that require you to build the entire thing from scraps of wood, or you can buy kits that just require you to snap a few parts together. If you want to make a huge, prolonged project out of your radio controlled plane, then you can buy one that requires full assembly. However, you should always be sure that your building skills are up for it. If you don’t want to spend the time required to do this, or if you don’t have the prowess to build it, then you can buy a plane that does not require any assembly at all. You just pull it out of the box, and you’re ready to go flying for the afternoon.

Next you will want to look for something that has stability for people without are flying for the first time. It may not seem like it, but to fly a radio controlled plane you need at least some skill. But, if you search for the right item you can find something that is more geared towards beginners. Slow flying speed is always a benefit, just as driving slow is a good way to learn how to control a car for the first time. You will want a light plane with larger wings that can catch the wind better. This will make takeoff easier. You will also want to look for planes that have flat bottoms, and wings mounted high on the body. If you get a plane that has all of these features, your maiden flight will be as smooth as possible.

Next you need to consider the model of the airplane you are going to buy. You can get model replicas of almost any type of plane, from the first Wright Brothers’ plane to modern military jets. If you are buying a model plane, you are probably already interested in planes to begin with. Think of what plane you are most intrigued by when you look through plane books, and see if you can find a kit that is modeled after that plane. This will give you a personal interest in the model that you are getting. When you fly it for the first time, it will be almost like being in the cockpit of the actual plane.

After you have decided on these issues when picking your plane, the rest is just up to personal preference. But if you pay close attention to these and pick your plane carefully, you will find that radio controlled flying is a great way to spend your time. It is a very rewarding hobby, and it can last you a lifetime if you choose planes that are compliant with your level of skill. After all, you don’t want to go out on your first flight and then crash your plane directly into the ground or a tree. So choose your first plane carefully, and you can avoid being immensely frustrated in the future.
