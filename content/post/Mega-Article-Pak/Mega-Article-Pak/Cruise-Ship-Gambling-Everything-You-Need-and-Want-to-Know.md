Cruise Ship Gambling:  Everything You Need and Want to Know

Gambling is a popular pastime of many American citizens.  Despite the popularity of gambling, it is illegal in many areas of the Untied States.  Currently, casinos are only allowed on Indian reservations, in Las Vegas, and in Atlantic City.  What does this mean for those that love to gamble?  It often means long trips and large amounts of money spent.  That is unless you want to incorporate gambling into your vacation.

Aside from the casinos offered on land, cruise ship casinos are some of the most popular casinos in the Untied States.  If you are interested in gambling on a cruise ship, you can also enjoy a vacation at the same time. That is if you intend on booking an extended cruise.  Extended cruises are cruises that tend to last more than three days.  In addition to extended cruises, it is possible to visit stationary casino cruise ships along the coast.  

When it comes to cruise ship gambling, there are many passengers who are concerned with the legal aspect of gambling.  It is true that gambling is illegal in most of the United States, but different rules apply when you are on international waters.  As soon as your cruise ship leaves the port, the casino is likely to open.  To stay on the safe side, a number of cruise ships wait until they are a few miles away from the coast.  

Gambling aboard a cruise ship casino is similar to gambling on land. Traditional casino rules should apply.  If a cruise ship’s gambling rules differ, you will likely see signs or rules posted somewhere within the casino.  If you are ever in doubt it is advised that you speak to a casino employee or a cruise ship representative. 

In addition to seeking guidance or clarification from cruise ship employees, it is also likely that they may teach you how to play a particular game.  Similar to dance lessons, you could easily learn how to play a number of popular casino games with the assistance of an experienced gambler.  Many of these onboard casino game lessons are free; however, not all are. On some cruise ships, you may be required to pay a small fee to participate in a gambling lesson.  

The casino games offered aboard a cruise ship are likely to vary. Many popular games include blackjack, roulette, poker, and slot machines.  The casinos games found onboard a cruise will all depend on the cruise ship in question. Certain casino games may be available on one ship, but not on another.  If you are interested in playing a particular casino game, you may want to check to see if that game is available before booking your cruise ship reservation.

As previously mentioned, cruise ship casinos are most often found on extended cruises. These are classified as cruises that stay over the water for a period of time. These cruises also travel from one destination to another.  Extended cruise ships often have a large number of activities, aside from gambling.  Cruise ship reservations and cabin rentals are often compared to the hotel rooms found at most casino resorts. When compared, an extend cruise is often the better value.  

Despite their popularity, not everyone is able to take an extended cruise.  If you still want to experience gambling aboard a cruise ship, but you don’t want to stay overnight, you can visit a coastal casino or a river casino.  Along the Untied States coast and a number of popular river banks, casinos are legal. These casinos were often legalized by local governments.  Stationary cruise casinos are similar to legalized land casinos. The only difference between the two is that they are located on the water.  

To gamble aboard a casino, whether it is a vacation cruise, a river casino, or a costal casino, you will have to make plans. River casinos and costal casinos do not require reservations, but vacation cruises do.  If you are interested in spending your vacation at a cruise ship’s casino, you must first make a reservation.  Once you have made those reservations, you can make plans to enjoy gambling on your vacation until you wish to gamble no longer.
