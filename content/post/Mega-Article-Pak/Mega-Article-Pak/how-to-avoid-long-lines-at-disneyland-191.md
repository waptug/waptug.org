How to Avoid Long Lines at Disneyland

One source of frustration for many visitors at 
Disneyland is the long lines for the rides. You can
literally spend several hours of the day standing in 
line to ride popular attractions. These lines can be 
avoided in one of three ways.

Get to the park early. The lines are shorter in the 
morning when the park first opens. Instead of 
jumping in line for the first ride you see, head for the 
rides that you really want to ride the most – the 
most popular rides. Another option is to purchase 
FastPass tickets for the rides that offer them. Again, 
do this early to ensure that you get to ride those rides 
earlier in the day.

The third option to avoid long lines at Disneyland is 
to ride many of the popular rides later in the evening, 
while the majority of people are enjoying the 
entertainment. Disneyland has nightly entertainment, 
and this is a good time to find shorter lines. Of 
course, it will mean that you probably miss the 
entertainment, so if you can use one of the other 
options for shorter lines at Disneyland, you should 
probably do so.
