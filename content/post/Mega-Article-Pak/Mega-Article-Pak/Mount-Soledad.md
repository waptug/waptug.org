Mount Soledad

Mount Soledad in beautiful La Jolla gives you the 
chance to enjoy amazing, 360 degree views under the
shadow of a towering cross.  All along the summit,
there are many veteran's plaques.  Mount Soledad is
truly splendid to look at, as it is a well known
fixture to the area of La Jolla.

On Mount Soledad, you stand more than 800 foot high
underneath the shade of a 43 foot high cross, and 
enjoy the views and splendor the mount provides.  You
can enjoy a picnic here, the panoramic views, or 
just watch the sunset.  Mount Soledad is also a 
great spot for photos, if you like to take photos.

Beauty - everywhere you look
Below Mount Soledad is the shimmering waters of La
Jolla Shores and terra cotta roofs of those that 
are very lucky folks indeed.  To the north you have
the coastline that extends all the way up to Orange
County.

To the south of Mount Soledad there are views of
Mexico with city skyline and everything else the 
area has to offer.  And off to the east, there 
are vistas as far as the eye can see.

The cross
You may be wondering just what the cross is and 
what it's for.  The story dates back to 1913, when
Pacific Beach residents built a cross out of redwood
and set it atop the mountain.  Thieves removed it
ten years later, and the replacement was created
in 1934, which was taken out by high winds in
1952.

Soon after that, the Mount Soledad Memorial 
Association build the current cross to commemorate
soldiers of the Korean and the two world wars.

The cross of Mount Soledad has been a subject of
controversy, although the problem appeared to be
solved in the late 1990s.  The San Diego Council
sold the cross and the half acre of land that
surrounds it to the Memorial Association.  

In 2002, mini walls were installed to honor the
veterans that are underneath the cross, though 
they have fueled more controversy from those who
feel that the towering symbol highlights Christian
vets over others that are there.

For those that live in the area, Mount Soledad and
the cross are a true beauty.  For visitors and 
tourists, Mount Soledad provides amazing views and
the cross seems to add to the detail.

If you ever visit La Jolla, make sure you check 
out Mount Soledad.  It's very close to the downtown
area, and it'll be one thing you'll be glad you
made time for.  The cross is something you simply
must see - as words can't begin to describe it.
