Why You Should Rate Videos You Watched Online

As the internet continues to rise in popularity, so does the number of activities that you can participate in online.  Online, you can shop, play games, listen to music, and watch videos.  If you are looking for a fun, but relatively inexpensive way to enjoy the internet, you should examine online video websites.  

Online video websites are websites that allow you, an internet user, to watch the videos that they have posted. Depending on the video website in question, many websites have a wide variety of different video types. These video types often include homemade videos, celebrity interviews, popular television shows, as well as music videos.  Despite the fact that not all online video websites are the same, there is something that you will find similar between them all. That is the ability to rate videos.

For ages, rating systems have been used to track what television watchers like to watch and what shoppers like to buy. Now, thanks to online video websites, especially those that allow you to rate their videos, you can also make your points known online.  Unfortunately, not everyone takes advantage of these rating systems, even though they should.  This is largely due in part to the fact that many internet users do not think that it is worth the time to rate the online videos that they have just finished viewing; however, this simply is not true.

Perhaps, the best reason for rating the videos that you watched online is that it may make the video owner proud, especially if they are “normal,” individuals who are just experimenting with a camera.  Even professional video makers, such as the ones who make music videos, want to hear feedback on their work.  With an online rating system, this could be done in as little as a few seconds.  Depending on the online video website in question, you should quickly be able to rate a video, literally without even having to think about doing so.

It is also a good idea to rate the videos that you have watched online, especially if you liked them a lot.  As previously mentioned, a large number of individuals make their own videos. These videos are often considered homemade movies because they are often made from home and with common camera equipment.  Although many individuals make an online video, there are many who decide not to make another.  By giving an online video you watch a positive rating, you will be letting the owner know that you liked their work. If they receive enough positive responses, there is a good chance that they will continue to make videos; thus providing you with more entertainment.  

In addition to stating that you liked or disliked an online video, it is important that you rate the videos that you watch online, well for ratings.  Despite what you may think, ratings are actually used. Many online video websites, including YouTube and Google Video, rank their videos. The order of those rankings is often a result of viewer ratings.  This means that if you do take the time, which should only be a few seconds, to rate an online video, you could be helping to make that video more popular.  Many online video websites display their top ranking videos right on their main page.  How cool is that?

It isn’t amazing what a simple click of a mouse could do?  As you can easily see there are a number of benefits to ranking online videos, especially ones that you enjoyed watching.
