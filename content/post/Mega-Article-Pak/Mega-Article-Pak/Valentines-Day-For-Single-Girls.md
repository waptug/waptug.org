Valentine’s Day for Single Girls

For most people, being alone on Valentine’s Day is simply no fun. Women especially find being alone on Valentine’s Day to be depressing and lonely. However, just because you are not in a relationship does not mean you can’t have a good time on Valentine’s Day. With a little creativity, single girls can have a great Valentine’s Day that they will remember for years and years. In fact they may find they have a better time when they are single on Valentine’s Day than they do when they are in a relationship. This article will offer a few tips for how single girls can have a great time on Valentine’s Day.

Calling up your other single friends and going dancing is a great way for a single girl to celebrate Valentine’s Day in style. You and your friends can get dressed up and head out to a local nightclub together to spend the evening dancing. Many women will actually find they have a better time doing this than going dancing with their boyfriends because their friends are more likely to want to dance all night long. When they go out with a boyfriend the boyfriend may want to spend more time eating or drinking than he wants to spend on the dance floor. However, single girls who are out on the town often spend hours and hours dancing when they go out and barely take a break all evening. 

Another fun idea for single girls on Valentine’s Day is to host a movie night at your place. You can invite over all of your single friends and rent a few romantic comedies. Instead of being sad and depressed you and your friends can watch the movies and make fun of all of the couples in the movie. It may not be the nicest or the most mature thing to do but it will help to prevent you and your friends from feeling depressed during the evening. Or if you prefer you can rent other types of movies such as horror movies or comedies. These will help to keep your mind of the fact that you are single on Valentine’s Day.

Single girls on Valentine’s Day can also have a great time by organizing a matchmaking game. You can call up all of your single friends and ask each of them to bring a single guy to your house for a get together. You can serve light appetizers and have music playing to keep the guests entertained. You can also purchase board games designed for use by couples and match up your single couples to play the game. Answering the questions will probably be pretty hard because the couples will not really know each other but it will be a fun way for some of your single friends and the friends of your friends to get to know each other. 

Another way for single girls to celebrate Valentine’s Day is to simply go out to dinner. Restaurants can be extremely crowded on Valentine’s Day because going out to dinner is a very popular idea for couples. However, even single girls have to eat on Valentine’s Day. You and your single friends can plan ahead and make reservations for dinner at one of the nicest restaurants in town. You will likely be surrounded by couples celebrating Valentine’s Day but it does not mean you still can’t have a good time. Get all dressed up and maybe even organize an outing to a spa beforehand so you and all your friends can get manicures and pedicures before you head out for the evening. This will help to make your dinner together even more fun because you will have a great bonding experience beforehand. While you are out to dinner with your single friends, start out with some great appetizers, order a few great dishes to share and don’t forget to finish your meal with an awesome dessert. Leave the dinners of salad and water to your friends who are trying to impress their dates and feel free to indulge in some great food while you are out with your single friends.
