Why Surround Sound?

If you are one of the many people around the world who hasn't yet switched to surround sound or a home theater system of some sort you may be wondering what the big fuss is all about. Can it really make that much of a difference to watching the television? The answer to that is that unless you have difficulties with your hearing, surround sound can make a marked impact on your overall movie viewing, computer gaming, and music listening experience. There is nothing like being in the center of the action and surround sound puts you in just that spot. 

You can hear the sounds the victim hears in your favorite crime drama from the same direction from which she hears those same sounds. You are literally in the middle of the action right along with her. Your heart will beat right along with subwoofer as anticipation builds (courtesy once again of the surround sound system) in your favorite suspense thriller. It's almost indescribably the way in which surround sound enriches the movie watching experience for even the most casual of movie watchers.

I will be the first to admit that I'm notorious for knitting or reading while watching television or movies and only looking up when something captures my attention-generally something I heard or a flash on the screen. This means that sound actually makes me pay attention to what is going on in the movies that I am listening to. I have noticed a marked difference in my interest in movies and television shows since adding surround sound to our home theater system. More and more often I am noticing that scarves and such take twice as long to accomplish and I blame it entirely on the superior sound that is part and parcel to our surround sound system.

You may not be someone who watches all that much television or even that goes to the movies all that often. If computer games happen to be your thing then you are going to love what surround sound can do for you. In case you've forgotten that little bit about it placing you in the center of the action, this works wonders in game and provides important hints to you as to what is going on around you. You can hear the bad guys (or merely the other side) as they attempt to sneak up on you and know where they are coming from. You can hear the hoof beats in the distance or hear the fires burning in barrels off to your left. You can hear the starships flying by as if you were right next to them in the middle of it all. It's truly an amazing boost to game reality and to the fun of gaming.

For music lovers, you can feel as though you were sitting right in front of the orchestra or on the front row at a concert for your favorite band. If you are playing music that is recorded live you will really enjoy the feeling of being in the middle of the crowd without the smoke and other fumes that might otherwise detract from your good time. Whether your first love is video, movies, games, or music surround sound has a way to make each of those experiences even more enjoyable in the comfort of your home.
