Sony New HD Camera

When Sony first unveiled the H3 to the market, it
staged none of the over the top glitz or glamour
many expected.  Held at a tiny theater inside a
Sony office in Tokyo, the event barely even 
resembled a minor product launch.

Although many don't think of Sony as a camera maker,
the company is number 1 in video cameras, holding
on to well over 40 percent of the market.  Sony
is a leader in many other industries as well, with
cameras helping to add the icing to the cake.

The HDW is the top of the line camcorder from 
Sony.  The HDW 900 is capable of recording and 
playing back 1080 progressive at 23.98 or 24, 25,
29.97, or 30 frames per second.  It can also play
back 50 or 60 fields per second at 1080 interlaced.

The camera also offers a memory stick setup system
that memorizes various parameters and enables instant
recall.  Once you set the camera up for the first 
time, it will remember the settings then go right
back to the previous parameters at the touch of a
button.

A simple switch operation will enable automatic
adjustment and black set, black balance, and even
white balance.  You can quickly and easily shift
colors with the video camera, making it easier to
use than most other high definition video cameras
on the market.

The HDW 900 from Sony will come standard with HD
zoom lens, a tripod, AC power supply, and 3 Anton
Bauer Hytron 100 batteries.  With everything it 
offers you and everything it comes with right from
the box, the HDW 900 is truly nothing short of 
amazing.  If you've been waiting for the perfect
high definition video camera - rest assured that
the HDW 900 is it.
