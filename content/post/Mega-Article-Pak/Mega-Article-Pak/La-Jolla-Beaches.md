La Jolla Beaches

From the family beaches that are most often preferred
by tourists to the more secluded coves most desired
by surfers, divers, and swimmers, La Jolla beaches
offer something for everyone.  From Blacks Beach to
the north and Windansea Beach to the south, the 
La Jolla shoreline consists of steep sandstone 
cliffs that are seperated by coves and sandy beaches.

They sunny yet beautiful breezes and picture perfect
views are a vacation paradise for tourists and a 
water recreation highlight for locals.  There are
seven unique beaches that dot the seven mile
coastline against a backdrop of real estate, resorts,
cliffs, tall palm trees, and lush scenary.

Downtown La Jolla is conveniently located near 
most of the beaches which not only provide parking
for beach visitors but plenty of fine restaurants,
intimate cafes, culture, art galleries, and other
types of commercial convenience.

Between mid day and 4 PM, the crowds at any of
the La Jolla beaches can be very big.  The best
advice when visiting any of the beaches in La Jolla
is to come to the beach early and stay late - so 
that you can enjoy the magic of the sunsets and
dusk views from across the ocean horizons.

Each beach at La Jolla will offer you something 
unique with different ways to enjoy the bliss of
your vacation.  La Jolla Shores is the most 
popular beach for families with the largest 
expansion of flat, sandy beaches.  If you enjoy
people watching, sunbathing, and lazy days on the
beach - La Jolla Shores is where you want to be.

La Jolla Cove is another excellent beach, with 
steep sandstone cliffs offering amazing views and
the paradise of sparkling blue water the cove is
known for.  The La Jolla Cove is a swimmer's dream
come true because of it's gentle water.  Along
with the Children's Pool, the Cove is rich with
reefs that attract scuba divers and snorkelers to
the abundance of marine life.

There are several La Jolla Caves that were carved
by nature into the sandstone cliffs between La
Jolla Cove and La Jolla Shores that help attract
ocean kayakers from around the world.  There is 
one cave in particular, known as "Sunny Jim Cave"
that can be entered through a man made tunnel
that leads to a steep descent through a narrow
underground tube to a wooden deck.

With plenty of beaches all along the coastline,
La Jolla is the place to be during the summer
months.  La Jolla is a well known tourist attraction,
with well over 7,000 people visiting on a daily
basis.  If you enjoy the beach, La Jolla is 
going to feel like heaven on earth.
