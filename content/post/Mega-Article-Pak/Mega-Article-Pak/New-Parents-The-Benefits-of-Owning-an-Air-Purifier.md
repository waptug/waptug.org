New Parents:  The Benefits of Owning an Air Purifier

Are you a new parent?  If not, are you expecting to become on in the future?  If so, when that moment comes, your life will literally change forever.  Like most parents, there is a good chance that you would do just about anything to ensure the health and safety of your new baby.  When doing this, do you know what an air purifier can do for you and your child?

There is a good chance that you have heard of air purifiers before. If you haven’t, they are machines, which are electronic. The goal of these machines is to help clean the air indoors. This is often done with filters and collection grids.  These filters and collection grids tend to trap bacteria and air particles, preventing them from circulating around inside your home.  Of course, clean air is important for all, but it is especially important for young children.

If the air inside your home or your child’s room is unhealthy, whether it be due to smoking, pets, or a lack of fresh air, do you know the impact it may have on your child?  Smoking, pet hair, and the lack of fresh air has been known to cause numerous health problems. These problems may include asthma.  That is why it is important that you do everything in your power to keep the air inside your home, or at least the air inside your child’s room clean and pure.  If you are a smoker or a pet owner, the best option may be to quit smoking or get rid of your pets, but if that is not an option an air purifier may do.

When it comes to purchasing an air purifier, especially if you would like it to have benefits to your child, you have a number of different options. Air purifiers tend to come in two main styles. These styles include individual room air purifiers and whole house air purifiers.  Individual room air purifiers tend to clean the air in a specific amount of space, usually anywhere from 200 to 500 square feet. Depending on the size of the room in question, certain air purifiers may even be able to clean the air inside one or two rooms. As you might assume, whole house air purifiers are air purifiers that clean the air inside a whole house. This is done when the air purifier is connected to a home’s heating and cooling system.

Once you have decided whether you would like to purchase a whole house air purifier or an individual room air purifier, you will have to decide on a specific air purifier make and model. When doing this, you will want to keep a number of things in mind. Perhaps, the most important thing to keep in mind is the overall cost of owning an air purifier.  A number of air purifiers are filter-less, but not all are; in fact, most require a filter. In many cases, you will find that these filters need to be replaced, every so often. It is important that you examine the cost of all replacement parts, including the filters. It is the only way to ensure that you are really getting a good deal.

In addition to examining the overall cost of an air purifier, you will also want to examine your uses.  If you would just like to have the air inside your child’s room be fresh and clean, you should be able to purchase just about any air purifier that is currently on the market.  However, if you would like an air purifier to remove the remnants of cigarette smoke or pet hair, you may need to look for an air purifier that specifically treats them.  What you plan on using your air purifier for is important; it is the key to making your purchase worthwhile.
