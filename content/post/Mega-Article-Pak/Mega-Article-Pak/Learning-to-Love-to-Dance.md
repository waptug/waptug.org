Learning to Love to Dance

Of all the gifts you can give your children in the world teaching them to love to dance is one of the greatest. Dancing is a great way to get your children active, keep them healthy, and in many instances, keep them happy. Throughout history dance has been said to be an outward expression of joy. I would think that joy and a way to express it is an excellent legacy to leave our children.

Even Shakespeare understood the importance of dance and the joy that dance was meant to be the expression of.

"To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do"

--The Winter's Tale 

In these words, this was a wish of great importance and meant to be good fortune to the one that was the object of the affectionate wish. It seems that somewhere along the way however, far too many have forgotten the great gift that dancing really is for the mind, the body, and the soul of man and woman alike. 

Teaching your children to love to dance will give them the foundation for a healthy lifestyle that is lower in stress than many of their friends and acquaintances along the way will ever know. It will instill in them the value of discipline and dedication along with the sheer joy of simply moving to the music. Not everyone is meant to dance on a competitive level but I cannot possibly believe that we were designed as we were and not meant to dance.

Learning to love to dance is also the greatest gift you can give yourself. Much like your children you need to bring physical fitness into your life. You need to reaffirm the importance of discipline in your life. Most of us need to relieve some of the stress that is in our lives and we all need to take a little more time for ourselves and concentrate on healing and renewing our own souls rather than spending all of our available energy nurturing and revitalizing others. 

We need to learn to love to dance as an outlet for pent up emotion as well as the opportunity to work out those things that drive us from within. We need dance as a method of battling with ourselves and as a way of expressing our personal joys and triumphs. Dance is an excellent means for all of these things and so much more.

There is no such thing as being too healthy. Dance can help lower blood pressure, increase circulation, improve muscle tone, and simply make you feel more energetic and alive. There are very few things that can compete with the invigoration of dancing. Learning to love to dance provides you the perfect opportunity to improve your overall health and fitness level without feeling as though you have done something wrong in the process. This is no lose situation for those who have nothing to lose other than a few pounds that have lingered far too long.

Now is the perfect time for you to begin the process of learning to love to dance. Once you've learned to love to dance you need to share that love and passion with those you love. This would be your friends and family. Dance together, play together, and live longer, happier lives together.
