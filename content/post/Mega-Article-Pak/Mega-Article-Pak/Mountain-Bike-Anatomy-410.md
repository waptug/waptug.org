the body of a bike.

brake lever to the brake mechanism.

3.  Brake lever - The lever on the handlebar to 
activate the brakes.  The left side is the front brake
and the right side is the rear brake.

power from the chain ring to the cogs.

5.  Chain ring - The toothed rings that attach to
the crank to hold the chain.
