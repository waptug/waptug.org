What to Consider When Making a YouTube Video

YouTube is a popular online website, which allows internet users, just like you, to share videos or watch an unlimited number of them.  While a good portion of the individuals who post videos on YouTube are just posting videos that they have laying around, there are many more who actually make videos with the sole purpose of uploading them to YouTube and sharing them with other internet users.  If you are one of those individuals, there are a number of points that you will want to keep in mind.

When it comes to making a YouTube video, one of the things that you will need is a video recording device.  Popular video recording devices include camcorder, webcams, as well as cell phones with video recording capabilities.  If at all possible, you will want to try and use a webcam or a camcorder, as these video recording devices often produce the best quality.  If you are looking to make your YouTube video be a hit, quality is something that you will want to take into consideration. Many YouTube video viewers dislike watching poor quality videos; in fact, not everyone sticks around to finish watching them.  

Editing is also something that you will want to take into consideration.  YouTube actually encourages you to examine your video before uploading it to their site.  If you notice anything that you would like changed, you are advised to edit your video before uploading it to YouTube.  Of course, you don’t have to edit your video if you don’t want to, but editing your video is also likely to improve the overall quality of your YouTube video.  It is also relatively easy to do.  Most computers come with movie editing software programs already installed.  It may even be a good idea to play around with a movie editing software program and your YouTube video; you may be surprised just how fun it can be. 

It is also important that you think about and examine the content of your video, especially if you are planning on doing a comedy video.  Comedy videos are popular on YouTube, but you need to remember that a large number of people visit YouTube for entertainment.  Many of those individuals are from different races, sexes, and religions.  You will want to be cautious of offending any of your viewers, intentionally or not.  Keep in mind that comedy means different things to different individuals.  Of course, you have the right to make just about any type of YouTube video you want; you are advised to use your best judgment.  Should you be good at making YouTube videos, you may be able to make a name for yourself on YouTube, but you will want it to be a good one.  

It is also important that you examine safety when making a YouTube video.  As previously mentioned, comedy videos are popular on YouTube and so are video blogs.  Video blogs are where internet uses recite their blog in front of a camera, instead of in print.  Video blogs are fun to do, but many video blogers, both on and off of YouTube, make the mistake of giving out too much information about themselves.  For your safety, you will want to avoid giving your real name, especially if you are showing your face on your video blog.  It is advised that you do not mention your real name in any of your YouTube videos, but you definitely do not want to mention your address or any of your phone numbers.  Not divulging your personal information is for your own safety.  You need to remember that you never really know who is watching your YouTube videos or what they are thinking.  

The above mentioned points are just a few of the many that you will want to keep in mind, before making a video which will later be posted on YouTube.  In short, aim for quality and keep internet safety in mind and your YouTube video could end up being a hit.
