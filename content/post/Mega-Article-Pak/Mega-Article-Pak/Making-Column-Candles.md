Making Column Candles

Column candles are very similar to taper candles, but they are wider and usually shorter. The top of column candles isn’t pointed like on a taper candle. Instead, it greatly resembles the top of a volcano. Column candles are very pretty and distinct. They have a classic look to them that is timeless. These candles have a ridge design rather than a smooth design like the column candles. They add beauty and charm to any environment. Making your own column candles is very easy.

Column candles burn for hours on end, making them a great investment of both your time and supplies to make them. On average, column candles burn for 35 hours. Column candles do not produce smoke or dripping, making them very popular. Some people experience frustration looking for holders to put their column candles in. They will fit all standard tea light holders and spiked base holders. 

You will need some basic items to start making column candles including wax, molds, wick, color, and fragrance. The fragrance is option, but definitely adds appeal to your column candles. To melt the wax properly, you will need a double boiler. You will want to make sure you use high quality paraffin wax to make your column candles. Bees wax looks beautiful, but does not hold up well with the structure of the column candle. Too much heat will cause a column candle made of bees wax to ooze all over, creating a mess as well as a candle that isn’t too pretty to look at. 

To ensure the design of your column candles is perfect, coat the inside of the molds with a special spray for them. You can also get the same results using a non-stick cooking spray. After you have melted the wax, dip the wick in it. You will want the wick to be several inches longer than the top of your mold. Insert the wick from the bottom of the mold. Hold it securely in the middle of the mold by tying the top of the wick to a pencil that lies across the top of the mold. 

This is the point in the process where you will want to add any color or fragrance to the melted wax. As soon as you have mixed it together, pour the hot wax into the molds. If you allow the wax to start cooling before you pour it the candles will have lumps in them. You can remove your finished candles from the molds as soon as they have completely cooled. Snip the excess wick to about 1/4 inch of the top of the candle. 

If you want to be more creative, you can add leaves or pressed flowers to the candles using a thin layer of decoupage medium onto the back of the object. Immediately press it onto the candle, holding it in place for a few seconds. To make ice crystal column candles, put crushed ice in the mold before adding the hot wax. For additional craft ideas, consider looking in a book or on the internet. You will find some really neat column candle crafting ideas that are quite simple to imitate.

Column candles are very unique in their look and appeal. You can make them without any difficulty. These candles make lovely centerpieces as well as personalized gifts. You can find all the supplies you need to make quality column candles at your local craft stores as well as on the internet.
