Overseas International Airports:  What You Need to Know

When it comes to air travel, many Americans do not just stay inside the United Sates, many leave the country. In fact, international travel is rapidly increasing in popularity.  Many individuals are now taking honeymoons overseas, as well as attending business meetings or scheduling family vacations.  If are planning on being one of those individuals, there are a number of important things that you need to remember. Perhaps, the most important thing that you need to keep in mind is that you will be in another country; another country that may have a whole other set of laws and regulations.

While it is a given that different countries have different laws, many air travelers are unaware that different countries also have different air travel rules.  Unfortunately, many believe that the rules enforced in the United States are worldly.  It is true that many of the same rules are enforced, all around the world, but there are some differences.  For that reason, you will want to take the time to learn those rules. You can easily learn these rules by contacting the United States Embassy or by requesting more information from the international airport that you plan on flying in or out of.

Although it is advised that you and all other foreign air travelers research the laws and air travel rules of another country, particularly the one you will be visiting, not everyone does.  Whether you choose not to research these rules or you can’t, you are advised to proceed with caution and use your common sense.  This not only includes packing your bags, but how you handle yourself in a foreign airport. Perhaps, when it doubt it is always best the follow the air travel rules enforced in the United States.  If you are questioned on your behavior or actions that you took, it is best to state that you were unaware of the rules that were you breaking, if any.

As previously mentioned, it is best that you use your common sense, when it comes to preparing for international travel. This begins by having all of the necessary documents, which are needed for international air travel.  Even if you are not required to bring it along, you may want to think about carrying your passport with you at all times. In the event that you are detained by airport security or by local officials, this piece of identification could come in handy.  

It is also important that you pack your bags the correct way. If you are flying out of the United States, no matter where you are traveling to, you will be required to follow all American air travel rules. This includes the carryon luggage ban of liquids and sharp objects.  Since the United States tends to have more air travel rules and security procedures than other countries, you may not have to worry about your luggage violating a ban in another country. However, you should be worried about what you try and bring home with you. The United States has numerous restrictions on items being imported from other countries, including gifts.  In most cases, you will find these gifts are not sold in airports, even international ones, but it is still advised that you refrain from purchasing exotic gifts, such as alcohol or live animals.  

In addition to the points mentioned above, it is extremely important that your follow any requests given to you by international airport security officials.  Unlike in the United States, where you may just receive a warning for your inappropriate behavior or actions, you may be subject to additional consequences. Those additional consequences, which may include being arrested by local authorities, will vary from country to country.  Regardless of what the consequences are, it is still advised that you follow any instructions given to you, by international flight crews or by airport security.

By keeping the above mentioned information in mind, you should have nothing to worry about.  The truth is that as long as you think before you speak or act, you should be okay, even in an international airport or a foreign country.
