Lease Trading

Ever wanted to terminate your lease early, comfortable with the thought you
weren’t going to be hit with hefty fees? You can if you transfer your lease 
to someone else. 

Trading a lease is the best option for people who want to terminate a lease 
early and don’t want to pay the large termination imposed by most lease 
agents. It can also be an alternative to get out of a lease for far less 
than you would otherwise pay your original lease company for extra mileage 
and wear-and-tear charges that can run into the thousands of dollars. 
For a small fee, you can advertise your car lease for assumption to a large 
number of potential buyers on the look-out for leases on the Internet. Such
 services include LeaseTrader.com, the originator of online lease-trading 
and the biggest online marketplace where most lease transfers take place, 
and smaller marketplaces such as BreakAlead.com and TradeAlease.com

Before swapping your lease, make sure your leasing company approves lease 
transfer transactions. Caution must be exercised in choosing a lease 
swapping service: make sure they facilitate the whole lease transfer 
process, offer online or telephone customer-service help and registered 
buyers undergo stringent credit checks.
