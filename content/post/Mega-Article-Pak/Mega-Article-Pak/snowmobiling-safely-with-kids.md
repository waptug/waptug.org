Snowmobiling Safely With Kids

Winter sports are a great way for families to spend time together while experiencing one of the most beautiful seasons that nature has to offer. Snowmobiling is one of the most thrilling ways to enjoy the winter weather as a family because they can usually rent state-of-the-art snowmobiles along with safety equipment that is needed rather than investing large amounts of money into the sport. Winter vacation resorts often give guests this rental option to relieve the hassle of hauling your equipment with you when you stay with them. In order to increase you family’s chances of having a fun and successful snowmobiling experience, though, there are some safety tips to follow. 

The most important safety guideline is that everybody should wear the proper equipment needed for operating a snowmobile. Parents are not an exception. In fact, parents should be the first to put on their protective gear so they can be a model for safe behavior for their kids. Proper snowmobile attire includes waterproof snowmobile suits, insulated and waterproof gloves, rubber bottom boots, and most importantly, snowmobile helmets that meet regulation standards. Together, all of this equipment helps snowmobile riders to stay dry and warm while enjoying the cold winter snow. 

Parents should also adhere to the age restrictions when it comes to having an enjoyable snowmobiling experience or vacation. Children under the age of 16 should not operate snowmobiles on their own. These are high-tech machines that require a certain amount of knowledge and skill in order to operate them safely and properly. Snowmobiles also require a certain amount of strength and stamina that children under the age of 16 often lack. Instead, kids between the ages of 6-16 are safer being an adult’s passenger on a snowmobile. Unfortunately, kids under the age of six should not be on a snowmobile at all. Some trails can be bumpy and unpredictable, making it difficult for kids to hold on properly and also making it difficult for parents to hold on to their child during a snowmobile ride.

Adults should take certain precautions before setting out each day on a snowmobile adventure, whether the plans are for a few hours or a few days. It is important to check the weather forecast before beginning your snowmobile trip. This can help you dress accordingly and take the proper equipment to help you brave the winter weather. Checking the status of the snowmobile trail conditions is also important. The safest thing to do is to stay on the groomed and maintained snowmobile trails rather than going on paths that are not traveled or maintained. Not only are they smoother, but if you get stranded, chances are greater that help will find you quicker. Always travel in pairs or groups with your children and first aid kits are also important to have in case of emergency. This should include a small repair kit for your snowmobile along with flares, an extra key, and a cell phone. 

Finally, it is best to snowmobile during the day. If your family is taking a multi-day snowmobiling trip, make sure you have time to reach your next destination while the sun is still lighting your way. You can see better during the day and, in case of emergency or equipment failure, others can find you easier during the daylight hours. Snowmobilers are also encouraged to keep their snowmobile’s headlights on at all times and tie a brightly colored flag to their antenna so others will be able to see them more clearly.  Other important safety tips are to stay away from snowmobiling on ice and to avoid snowmobiling near roads and other areas where pedestrians often congregate.

Using safety is an important way to fully enjoy the opportunities and thrills that snowmobiling has to offer. It is a great way to keep families active and a great form of exercise even during the cold winter months. With the lack outdoor activities available during the winter season, snowmobiling is a fun and exciting way to enjoy the outdoors for families who would otherwise stay indoors and watch television. Although it takes preparation and precaution, being a safe snowmobiling family will have an immeasurable payoff that everybody will appreciate.
