How to use Streaming Video

Using a streaming video is often much easier than downloading the video to one’s hard drive.  There are a number of different reasons for this.  It is especially true of individuals that are new to learning about computers and those who may not be especially familiar with how a computer works or the different components of a computer.  When considering how to use streaming video, it is much less complicated than the use of downloading videos.  If a person does not remember where they saved a video, it can be very difficult to find it later.

There are many times that the computer will pick a place for the video, and if the individual does not change the save location, they may be confused later as to where the video file went.  Compared to this, how to use streaming video is much more appealing.  There is no where to save the streaming video, so the individual who is watching it does not have to locate it later.  Streaming means that the material is always coming forth from the source.  

When it comes to streaming video, and how to use streaming video, the individual merely needs to go to the web site location of the streaming video.  From there, they will be able to click play on the streaming video player that is being used.  The file will then begin to play for the individual.  The individual will be able to pause and rewind the file just like when playing a downloaded video.  Also, since the file is already on the web site and always being streamed from the source, it takes less time to begin watching the video in most cases, since the downloading process of a video can take a long time.  This way, streaming video can save the individual time and energy.  Once the video has been played, it can be played again and it will still not take up any more time than is necessary to connect with the host that is streaming the file.  

In order to use streaming video, the individual does need to be connected to the internet the whole time, since this is where the file is coming from.  This is another difference between downloading a video clip and playing a streaming video clip.  If an individual is watching a downloaded video, the person does not need to stay connected to the internet after the file is downloaded.  They will need to be connected when the file is downloaded, but after that process is complete, whether they are connected to the internet or not, their file will still be able to be played.

These are the very simple ways in which individuals can learn how to use streaming video clips for both personal and professional reasons, as well as being able to highlight the differences between streaming video and downloaded video clips, and what each of these can do for the individual that wants to play a video clip of any source on a media or video player.
