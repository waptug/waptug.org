The Three Best Buy Elliptical Trainers
	
Elliptical trainers are very new and are a great alternative to treadmills. You have heard about the many elliptical trainers that are available on the market, however, which ones should you get. Elliptical trainers should not be judged just on price, but also on rating the machine itself. We will go over the best three elliptical trainers that fit the best price and value for the money that you pay.
	
Elliptical trainers that are under one-thousand dollars usually are questionable as far as quality. However, the Nordic Track CX 990, falls in the rare elliptical trainers that has one of the bets prices on the market, along with good quality. This machine has a incline feature that can change the incline form ten all the way up to 30%. This is a great feature to add intensity to your workout, along with the ten levels of resistance that you can change. Now most Elliptical trainers only have a ninety day warranty, however, the CX 990 has a one year warranty which makes this machine a safe and smart buy for people who plan on using the machine regularly and want to maintain a nice low budget not wanting to spend less then one-thousand dollars on elliptical machines. 
	
The Smooth CE 3.2 is a very great value for a low amount considering all of its features compared to other elliptical trainers. Besides having a heavy duty flywheel and electromagnetic brake system, it also has a wireless heart rate control and a hand grip HRC. The Hand Grip HRC by Smooth  is exclusive technology that other elliptical trainers do not have. The CE 3.2 also includes nine programs and has ergonomic, pivot foot pedals to make using the machine easier without having a risk of injury. There are some elliptical trainers that do not let your body move in full alignment of the machine which does add some risk for injury. The Smooth CE 3.2 does allow your body to move your body in full alignment of the machine which is not only safer, but also provides a much more comfortable workout. This machine retails for less then one-thousand-five-hundred dollars, which is a great deal for not only for the machine, but also for the reputation of Smooth.
	
The Precor EFX 5.33 beats all other elliptical trainers on the market and is the top value for your money. This machine can be found at health clubs and offers a full body workout eliminating the need to join or go to a gym. It has movable handlebars, a twenty degree elevated ramp that is non adjustable as well as forward and reverse elliptical strides. The best thing about this machine is that it offers some of the best quality parts and even has a ten year warranty on the individual parts of the machine, as well as a one year service warranty on the machine. There are no elliptical trainers that can compare to the quality, craftsmanship and performance of this machine which is no wonder that this machine is slightly over three-thousand-five-hundred dollars. Despite the cost, the Precor EFX 5.33 will save you thousands of dollars in the long run, as you will not have to be replacing machines over the years. This is by far the best investment that you could put into any of the Elliptical trainers on the market, if you can afford to pay for the cost of the machine all at once. 
	
All of these elliptical trainers have their different benefits along with their unique features that make them stand out. However, one common theme that these Elliptical trainers share is that they are the top three best buys for their class.
