Aspen Nightlife – Winterskol

Since Aspen is a wintertime playground for so 
many people, it is only fitting that everyone in 
Aspen during the month of January participates 
in Winterskol. This is literally a celebration of 
winter, cold, and snow – which is a great deal 
of what makes Aspen, well, Aspen! Winterskol 
is the ultimate Aspen party.

Winterskol is held during the month of January 
each year, and it is the wildest winter 
celebration you will ever experience. The 
highlight of Winterskol is the Canine Fashion 
Show, where pets are dressed up in crazy 
clothing, such as miniature bridal gowns. 
Winterskol has been an Aspen tradition for 
more than fifty years – and it will continue for 
at least another fifty! The first Winterskol 
celebration was held in 1951.

During Winterskol, more than 40 events are 
scheduled in the downtown area, Aspen 
Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk 
Mountain, and Snowmass Mountain. The 
entire area gets involved in the activities. 
Winterskol is a celebration of Aspen’s Nordic 
ancestry, as well as a celebration of winter. 
While most events are scheduled in advance,
Winterskol also brings several surprises as 
well. You just never know what you will find at 
the Winterskol celebration – until you are there.

Favorite traditional activities include the Canine 
Fashion Show, Winter sculpt, the Buttermilk 
Uphill Race, and Snowmass Splash. Don’t 
miss the torchlight descent and the fireworks 
display over Aspen Mountain. Don’t miss the 
unique competitions happening all over town. 
There is constant live entertainment all around 
town as well. If you are planning a ski vacation, 
and you want to have the time of your life – 
your destination should be Aspen, and your 
arrival date should coincide with the start of 
Winterskol.

Winterskol is an ongoing week long party with 
something for everyone. Amusement, 
entertainment, parties, and celebration are top 
priorities during the week of Winterskol. You 
have to experience Winterskol at least once in 
your lifetime – and after you have been once, 
you will be back. Winterskol is a celebration 
that is comparable with Mardi Gras in New 
Orleans – but a lot safer, and in many 
opinions, more enjoyable.

As they do for Mardi Gras, people come from 
all over the world for Winterskol. Event 
packages are available, but all of the lodges, 
hotels, motels, condos, cabins, and 
campgrounds sell out early. Make sure that you 
book lodging for Winterskol well in advance, 
and take advantage of the packages that the 
various lodges offer. Packages typically 
include lodging, airfare, rental cars, and 
other things that you may require as well.
