Making Exercise More Fun

Nothing beats waking up in the morning with the thought
of going to the gym to lift weights or jog on the
treadmill.  After a hard days work, the gym is one
place you don't even want to think about.  Sometimes,
even the thought of exercising at home with your own
equipment can be less than desirable.  

Sometimes, just trying to get and stay motivated to
exercise on a regular basis can be a challenge.  No
matter how you look at it, exercise can be downright
boring and even tedious at times.

So, you may be wondering just how you can get the
motivation you need to exercise on a regular basis.
If you've been wondering what you can do to make
exercise more fun, you'll find some ideas below that
just may help to make exercise more fun and a little
bit easier.

First things first, you should exercise with a friend.
You can challenge each other, help each other out,
keep each other motivated and on track, make each
other laugh or just make a game out of your exercise
programs.

You can also try something different.  If you go
to the gym each and every day and use the same 
piece of equipment or use the same piece of 
equipment at home, you should try mixing things up.
Reverse your routine or just change the order of
your exercises.  

Go to a city park that has playground equipment and
use the slide, climb on the monkey bars, do pull-
ups, hang from your knees, just let your imagination
guide you.  You don't always need to follow a strict
routine, just get out there and have fun working
your muscles.

An outdoor circuit in the park is also something
you can try.  There are some parks that have circuit
courses set up with a planned course where all
you have to do is walk or jog to each station and
then follow the instructions. If there isn't a 
planned course, then you should do a combination
of jogging and walking, picking a distance of a 
couple hundred feet.  Jog 100 feet then drop and
do a couple of pushups, walk the next 100 feet 
and then drop to do sit ups.

You can also ride a bike around your neighborhood
or hike on a hiking trail.  A walk in the park or
around your neighborhood is also a great way to
get some exercise.  Doing yoga in the park or on
a beach is also a nice and relaxing way to 
exercise both your body and your mind.

Playing a competitive sport is also something you
can try.  A lot of cities have team activities
such as softball, volleyball, tennis, soccer, 
and so on.  These types of activities will not 
only provide you with good exercise but they will
also help you to meet new people as well.

When you exercise, try to picture your muscles
getting bigger.  Research has shown that if you
focus all of your thoughts on the muscles that
you are working, they will respond better.  Try
to watch them work with each repetition as your
muscles contract and relax.

As you can tell, there are plenty of ways you can
make exercise more fun and interesting.  You don't
need to follow the same routine day after day,
as you can do many other things to get in some
exercise.

The important thing is that you should always try
to incorporate exercise in any various form into
your everyday life and make these habits the kind
of habits that will last a lifetime.
