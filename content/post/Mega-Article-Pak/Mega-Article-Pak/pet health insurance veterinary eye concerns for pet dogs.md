Pet Health Insurance Veterinary eye Concerns for Pet Dogs

Owners who are considering purchasing pet health insurance for their dogs should make sure that the eye health of their dogs covered by the insurance policy. Because many insurance companies will not insure the eyes of a dog whose breed is habitually diagnosed with chronic eye problems may want to consider purchasing their puppy from a CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation). Breeders who are recognized by the CERF have been publicly acknowledged as breeding puppies without known health problems. In some cases insurance companies might also require that the owners have genetic screening done on the puppies before they can be insured.

Glaucoma is a common eye condition that begins with very subtle symptoms such as dilated pupils that don't respond well to light, and eye that appears to be red, poor vision, and corneas are often cloudy.  One California-based veterinarian claims that because the initial symptoms of Glaucoma can be very subtle many California pet owners to not immediately bring their dogs and for an examination.  If Glaucoma is not immediately seen by a veterinarian within 24 to 48 hours the increased pressure in the eyeball can lead to permit it cases of blindness.  In severe cases of untreated Glaucoma veterinarians have been forced to remove the pet's eye.
	
Any dog who has the developed an irritation in their eye that causes them to square to produce extra tears is called a "squinting dog".  Most cases of squinting is caused from a minor irritation such as an in turned eyelash or minor scratch to the cornea.  However some cases of squinting dog has led to the early diagnosis of diseases such as cancer and Blastomyosis.

The Dermoidis is a benign corneal neoplasam. It is sometimes referred to as the third eyelid. Hair growing from the Dermoidis can irritate the dog’s eye which can cause discharge and occasionally cause an ulcer to appear on the eye.
	
Once you have seen a person or animal with cataracts you will always be able to diagnose them. The official definition of a cataract is opacity of the lens. When you look into an eye that has a cataract it looks as if a darkly tinted contact lens has been placed over the lens. If the cataracts become too thick the pet will go blind.

Shar Peis. Cocker Spaniels, Labradors, and Rottweilers are susceptible to eye condition called Entropion. Entropio, happens when an eyelid fold inward toward the eye and causes the eyelashes to brush against the cornea. The irritation of the eyelashes rubbing the cornea generally gives the eye a squinty drippy appearance. Bulldogs, Poodles, and Cocker Spaniels are often diagnosed with a condition called Cherry eye.

Dry eyes is the term used to describe the eyes of a dog that isn’t producing enough tears. Lhasa Apso, Pugs, and Shih Tzus are breeds that are particularly susceptible to dry eyes. Dog owners should bring their dogs to the veterinarian as soon as they notice any of the following conditions; squinting, tearing, pawing at the eye, cloudiness, bloody eyes, a blind eye (this can happen very abruptly), constantly dilated pupils, and swollen eyelids. Dog owners need to understand that early diagnosis is often the key to preventing further eye issues.
