Caution When Using Gas or Nitro Powered Remote Control Helicopters

In contrast to electric helicopters, there also exist gas or nitro powered remote control helicopters that you should really check out, if you think you have it in you.  Of course, the gas powered helicopters can be more work intensive, but they can also be more rewarding.  You see, it is the gas or nitro powered remote control helicopters that are capable of really showcasing the best agility level and the highest, fastest flying capabilities.

At least that’s what I’ve typically found with my helicopter purchases.  Either way, you can really have a ton of fun with gas or nitro powered remote control helicopters and if you don’t mind replacing their fuel when it runs out and working carefully to avoid fire when you’re setting them up for flight, you can really have a wonderful time.

I remember once helping another shopper with a gas or nitro powered remote control helicopter purchase, and they really found that they could have much more fun with this type of helicopter than the electric helicopter that they were using before then, because the electric one just didn’t respond as well to the remote control.  I don’t know for sure if this is the case universally, or if this particular customer found that gas or nitro powered remote control helicopters were better than electric helicopters based on a single, isolated incident, but I do know that when I discuss which helicopter is better with other professional fliers, I typically get the same answer.  Gas or nitro powered remote control helicopters are indeed more work, but they are also unparalleled in their ability to fly well.

For instance, let’s say you want to fly your helicopter further backwards than any other person and make it to the Guiness Book of World Records.  Well, I have typically heard that people find the gas helicopters to last longer—the electrical charge in electric helicopters runs out before the fuel does.  That said, the gas or nitro powered remote control helicopters are also much more expensive, and you do need to know that you have to restore the gas whenever it runs out, and cleaning the apparatus also takes more ingenuity and work.  But of course, if you’re up for the challenge, the rewards are well worth it.  Just make sure that when you purchase gas or nitro powered remote control helicopters, as with any large transaction, that you are buying from a reputable independent or commercial dealer, and you have researched the price trends in your area, so you know you’re getting the best deal you possibly can for your money.

There is little more frustrating that purchasing your first real gas or nitro powered remote control helicopter and finding out that your next door neighbor got a similar one for a lot cheaper, and is happier with it because they had money left over to take a trip out to the country and really fly it around.  The choice is up to you, but if I had to choose one, I would choose the gas helicopter over the electric one!
