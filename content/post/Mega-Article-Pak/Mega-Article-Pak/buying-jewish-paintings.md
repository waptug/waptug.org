Buying Jewish Paintings

I have a family that has commissioned me to find all of the Jewish paintings I can find.  He has given me no budget constraints.  I’m not sure why he doesn’t have guidelines set up for me to follow; he just wants to amass a collection quickly.

I found an oil on canvas that was a Jewish painting called Jewish meeting.  The artist was Amparo Cruz Herrera.  The artist is Spanish and this work exuded grace.  I liked it a lot.  I purchased it for eight thousand dollars.  My benefactor was happy with the purchase.

My client made no distinction between Jewish paintings that were of a religious nature and those that were only painted by a Jewish person.  I bought a rare Leon Bakst that was dated 1910.  His subject was a person in an exotic costume.  I’m not sure where my client plans to display it.

The next Jewish painting I found for him was a cityscape in oil of a deserted house in Veroia.  This painting only cost six thousand dollars.  Veroia is a Jewish neighborhood in northern Greece.  I thought that this painting was a little bit unsettling.

I found another good Jewish painting for my client.  The title of the painting was Juedisches Oesterreich Jewish Austria and was created by Frank Ettenberg in 2004.  The person that sold me the painting said that the painting evoked a feeling of the artist's state of being face to face with nationalism, his ethnic identity and an existential situation.

I found another Jewish painting I liked for four thousand dollars.  The oil painting called Birds of Paradise was painted by Maurice Sterne.  Sterne was a Jewish immigrant from Russia.  He was the first person to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  He exhibited 174 paintings, drawings and sculptures.

I found a Jewish painting of a cat that sold for thirty five hundred dollars.  The artist of this work was Wettingfeld Zarojewski.  I could not find any other work from this artist at all.  My client really liked it.  He is also a cat lover in addition to being a collector of Jewish art.

There was a wonderful Jewish painting of a woman seated.  I fell in love with it on sight.  The woman depicted looks so reflective and comfortable.  I feel at ease just gazing at her.

I finally found a religiously significant Jewish painting for my client.  The artist was Joan Landis and the title of the painting was Simhat Torah.  This is the painting that was used by Pomegranate Publishing for their 2003 calendar and their greeting cards.  I thought it was lovely.

I liked the Jewish painting by Joan Landis so much that I sought out more of her work.  I purchased two paintings.  One of the paintings was named Shabbat and the other one was Mikveh.  I took the three that I purchased to my client and he fell in love with them.  He asked me to find more of her work.

I found more work by Joan Landis and I purchased every one I came across.  I found three more of the Jewish paintings on eBay at reasonable prices.  I purchased Shavuot, Purim and Birth for three thousand dollars each.  I felt like I got a bargain.

I liked the colors in the Jewish painting I bought called The Tailor Shop.  This painting was created by Jacob Glushakow.  He was an active member of the Jewish community in Baltimore.  His parents were immigrants from Russia at the start of WW1.  He has a painting that is still kept in the permanent collection of the Baltimore Museum of Art.

I was fortunate to find two Jacob Glushakow Jewish paintings on the same buying trip.  The other painting I found was entitled Barn in Maryland.  I liked it a lot and my client was very pleased with what I brought for him.
