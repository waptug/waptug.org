Universal Studio Tours Blackout Dates

If you are a regular annual pass holder for Universal 
Studios Tours, there are certain blackout dates 
when you cannot visit the park unless you pay for a 
one day full priced ticket for the blackout date. Not 
being aware of these dates may cause you 
problems, so make sure you know when they are!

In 2006, there are no blackout dates during the 
months of January through June, and no blackout 
dates in October. Every Saturday and Sunday are 
blacked out for July and August. Additionally, July 
3rd and 4th are blackout dates. September 2nd and 
3rd, November 24th and 25th, and December 26th, 
27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, and 31st are all blacked out.

Additionally, the park is closed on Thanksgiving 
Day and Christmas Day. If you are a regular annual 
pass holder, either upgrade to a premium or deluxe 
annual pass, or avoid the Universal Studios Tours 
on these dates so that you will not have to pay the 
full one day price – which costs almost as much 
as a regular annual ticket!
