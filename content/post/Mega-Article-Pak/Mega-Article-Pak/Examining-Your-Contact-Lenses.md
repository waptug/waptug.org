Examining Your Contact Lenses

As we all know, contact lenses are the preferred means of vision correction.  They are far superior to glasses, in more ways than one.  Over the years contact lenses have established themselves, and are now used by more than a million people throughout the United States.  Although contact lenses are great to wear if you need vision corrections, there are some things you should know.

Before you put your contact lenses in your eyes, you should always inspect them for tears or defects.  Sometimes, contact lenses can get tears in their material, resulting in serious problems if you put them in your eyes.  You should also inspect your lens for debris or smudges as well, and clean them thoroughly if you find anything wrong.  If the lens is torn, you should immediately discard it and replace it with a fresh contact lens.

No matter type of contact lenses you use, you should always inspect them. Depending on how you handle them, you may sometimes scratch the material.  Scratches on the contact can be very serious, especially if you aren’t aware of it and put the contact in your eye.  It can cause you serious trouble, such as an infection or even scratch your cornea.  The easiest way to prevent this is to examine your contacts before you wear them.

Before you put your contacts in your eyes, simply let them rest on your index finger and look them over.  Once you have inspected that side, simply put the in the palm of your hand and give them a thorough inspection.  You should always do this one contact lens at a time, before you plan on wearing them.  If you wear contacts, you should always make inspecting them a part of your daily routine.

Along with inspecting your contact lenses you’ll need to keep them clean.  You can clean your contacts after you have inspected them, by putting a few drops of your solution in the palm of your hand and gently rubbing your contact around.  This will help to remove any dirt or debris that you find on the contact, and keep them clean.  If you don’t clean your contacts on a regular basis, you may end up getting an eye infection.

Contact lenses are a great investment for anyone who needs vision correction, although you’ll need to take care of them.  Whether you wear soft or hard contacts, you’ll need to clean them on a regular basis and examine them for defects, dirt, or tears.  Contacts can get torn or damaged rather easily, and the only way to tell is to examine them.  If you catch the defect before you put the contact in your eye - you should be able to replace it with a clean lens before it can do any damage.
