Throwing a Potluck New Years Eve Party

If you are planning to host a New Years Eve party this year, you might want to consider making the party a pot luck event. Most people consider potlucks for picnics and parties for other occasions but a potluck is rarely considered when throwing a New Years Eve party. However, there are a number of advantages to hosting this type of event. Some of these advantages include reducing the amount of work required by the host of the party, ensuring the guests all enjoy some of the food provided and cutting down on the amount of leftovers the host has at the end of the evening. This article will examine the logistics of hosting a potluck New Years Eve party.

A potluck is a good idea for a fun New Years Eve party. Some hosts may be hesitant to ask their guests to contribute a dish for the party but there are a few ways to make the potluck a great deal of fun. One way to do this is by implementing a theme for the party. The host can take the responsibility for preparing the main course and then assign each guest to bring another part of the meal to the New Years Eve party with the stipulation that the dish they bring should fit with the theme of the party. 

While a potluck New Years Eve party greatly reduces the responsibility of the host in terms of food preparation, it is important for the host to remember she is still responsible for coordinating the meal. The host should take care of ensuring all of the elements of the meal are provided. This is important for preventing each guest from bringing a dessert and none of the guests bringing savory items such as the main course, side dishes, salads or appetizers. One way the host can do this is to indicate on each guest’s invitation which type of dish they should bring. The guest may assign 2-3 people to bring side dishes and 4-5 people to bring appetizers, 4-5 people to bring side dishes, 4-5 people to bring salads and 2-3 people to bring desserts. This will help to ensure there is a variety of item in each category. 

It is also important to consider food service when planning a New Years Eve party. This logistical matter is especially important if guests will be providing items which must be served hot. The host might want to consult with the guests to determine what they will be bringing to contribute to the New Years Eve party and how the food should be served. If it is necessary to serve the item hot, the host should plan ahead to make accommodations to reheat the item or keep the item hot if the guest arrives with the item still hot. This is important because dinner will not likely be served immediately when guests arrive. 

Beverages should also be carefully considered when planning a potluck New Years Eve party. One way to deal with beverages is for the host to supply all of the beverages. This is a good solution because alcoholic cocktails are particularly popular for New Years Eve parties and the host may prefer to plan on providing a few signature cocktails throughout the evening and will want to ensure they have the ingredients necessary to create those categories. While the host may want to provide all of the alcoholic beverages, she may allow a few guests to bring non alcoholic beverages as their contribution to the pot luck.

Finally, when planning a New Years Eve potluck it is important to ensure guests are aware of any dietary restrictions which should be considered when making the food for the party. For example if the host is aware that several guests require special diets such as diets for diabetics or diets for those with high blood pressure she want to make sure guests who will be preparing food for the party are also aware of these restrictions. The host may also want to ensure at least one main dish item is vegetarian in case any of the guests do not eat meat.
