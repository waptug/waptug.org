Formula D Fans:  Show Your Support for the Sport

Are you a fan of Formula D, otherwise known as Formula Drifting?  If you have a love for cars, racing, or anything else along those lines, there is a good chance that you are. Drifting has always been a relatively popular sport in the United States, but its popularity climaxed with the development of a professional Formula D series.  Despite that popularity, the sport is still unknown by many.  Formula D needs your help to keep its popularity on the rise.  If you are wondering how you can go about doing this, you are not alone.

When it comes to helping Formula Drifting increase in popularity, there are many individuals who over analyze the situation. There are even others who think it is too much work. Well, this is simply not true. If you want to help Formula D become all that it can be, all that you have to do is be a fan. Sounds simple enough doesn’t it?  While it is important to be a fan, you want to be more than just a fan.  You want to be a fan that has a love and a passion for the sport. There are a number of different ways that you can go about accomplishing this.

Perhaps, the easiest way is to watch television programming that is focused on Formula D, including coverage of live events.  To do this, you will need to have access to G4TV. G4TV is one of the few television networks that airs Formula D programs. The only problem with this is that the network has recently scaled back their coverage.  Not as many programs are shown as they were in the past and many are being repeated, without cycling through old repeats first.  To not only keep newer Formula D programs featured on G4TV, but to ensure that they keep their partnership with Formula Drift, you are advised to tune in as much as possible. 

When it comes to television and the programming that airs on it, networks will not air programs that no one watches. Of course, in a way, this defeats the purpose of repeats.  Most individuals can only watch a certain program a couple of times before it becomes too much to handle.  Although these may prevent you from tuning into the Formula D coverage offered on G4TV, you are advised to think about the bigger picture.  High ratings are the only way that a network will know that their viewers are interested.  By tuning in or writing to the G4TV staff, you may help to keep the sport of drifting alive and interesting, at least on television.

In addition to watching Formula D events on television, you are also encouraged to watch them live, in person.  The only problem with this is that there are a select number of locations in which Formula D events take places. These locations tend to include California, Georgia, Washington, Illinois, and New Jersey. If you are in the area, when one of these events are taking place, you are advised to attend one.  In addition to having an exciting day, full of action, you will also find that these events are fairly easy to afford.  Many venues only charge an admission fee of around twenty dollars per person. This means that you could easily afford to attend a Formula D event on your own or with your family.
When it comes to attending a live Formula D event, many fans are unsure exactly how it may help to increase the popularity of the sport.  When a large number of fans turn out for a particular event, the event promoters are usually pleased.  A large fan turnout will almost always guarantee that the event will occur again, often at a later date. A large fan turn out may also help to spark new Formula D event venues. If and when this does occur, they will likely be in new areas; thus giving fans, who were previously unable to attend an event the opportunity to do so.

As you can easily see, there are a number of different ways that you can go about supporting Formula Drifting.  In fact, as a fan, it is likely that you already attend live events or watch sports coverage on television.  If so, did you know that you are helping out the sport, likely in more ways than one?
