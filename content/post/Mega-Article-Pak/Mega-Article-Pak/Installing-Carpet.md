Installing Carpet

A majority of how your interior looks and feels will
depend on your floors.  Houses that have carpet
give off an undeniable warmth, vibrancy, and an
aesthetic appeal.  There is a wide range of colors,
textures, materials, and designs available that can
transform your home and give every room a chance
to be unique.  Your carpet installation has a long
term perspective, so it's important that you select
the best one for your needs and install it right the
first time.

Once you have picked out your material and design,
you'll need to it install it.  Professional carpet
installers can do the job for you, or you can choose
to do it yourself.  Even though doing it yourself
is cheaper than hiring a professional, it isn't 
recommended if you don't have the right tools, lack
time, or have no experience.

A great way to ensure a professional installation
of your carpet is to buy from an authorized carpet
retailer or dealer.  Most of the time, your carpet
retailer will have an installation staff that is
very experienced with installing carpet.

If the retailer doesn't offer an installation 
service, they can still guide you to a reputable
and experienced installer.  Even though installation
by a retailer is a bit more expensive, it offers
several advantages.  The experience will show in
their work and you'll come out better in the long
run.  You can also approach them if you aren't 
satisfied with anything they have done.

However, if you are looking for low budget carpet
installation services, you'll also have the option
of hiring independent contractors, architects, 
builders, or interior designers.  You should
always remember to get their references and inquire
about their experience, where they received their
training, and any certification they may have.

You can also visit homes that the installer has
previously worked on, as this will give you an
idea of their work before you hire them.  If it 
isn't possible, you should at least make it a 
point to see some pictures of their work.

Even though private contractors may offer a lower
rate for carpet installation than your retailer,
the services of post installation may be very
poor.  If you encounter a problem, you'll find
that your options are limited.  No matter what
happens, if you choose an independent carpet
installer, you should always make sure that the
installer follows the standard for installation
of residential carpet CRI 105.

Choosing the right installer for your carpet will
entirely depend on your specific needs.  If you
like to change your carpet type every few years,
you may be better off to choose an independent
carpet installer.  If you want carpet that will
last for a long time, you should get a follow up
from a retailer, as this will ensure that you 
have a trouble free experience with installation.

No matter who you choose, you should ensure prior
to installation the carpet is power stretched
so wrinkling and rippling will be minimized.
It is also important that your rooms are 
measured before laying any of them and the sub
floor has been cleaned.  

You should also vacuum the old carpet good before
it is removed, to help eliminate dust.  Once
the new carpet is down, the edges should be
trimmed and sealed with hardwood.  You should
always inspect the carpet, and make sure that
nothing looks out of the ordinary and that
everything pleases you before you finish the 
deal.

You should always keep in mind that no matter
how expensive or exotic your carpets may be, it
is the installation process that makes or breaks
the look of your home.  Therefore, it pays off
to invest a bit of time, money, and effort when
you choose the right installer for your carpet.
