Aspen Nightlife

Finding things to do in Aspen, Colorado during the 
day isn’t difficult – get out on the slopes and ski or 
enjoy one of the other winter sports that you love. 
At night, however, Aspen really comes to life with 
Aspen nightlife! No matter how old or young you are, 
there is something to do in Aspen twenty-four hours 
a day, seven days a week.

Music and dancing are the biggest Aspen nightlife 
attractions, but there is more to do than just that – 
so if you aren’t quite old enough to get into the 
various bars and clubs in the area, don’t think that 
you will be bored at night – you won’t be! Start by 
finding out what activities are planned for the 
evening at your lodge or hotel. Most lodges and 
hotels have events planned throughout the season 
– and this is a good place to start finding things to 
do after the slopes have closed for the day.

Shopping in Aspen is another highlight. There are 
many galleries and specialty shops that you won’t 
find in your own hometown. Take advantage of this. 
Most shops are open after the slopes have closed 
for the day, and many stay open late because they 
understand that you want to spend your daylight 
hours out on the slopes.

If you aren’t old enough for the club scene, take 
advantage of the teen nights that are offered by many 
of the resorts. These are safe fun nights for teens, 
which parents will approve of.  Teens also enjoy the 
offerings at many of the spas. Spas aren’t just for 
adults. Enjoy the skin treatments, massages, 
saunas, and hot tubs. Some resorts also have game 
rooms for the teens and younger kids.

If you are old enough for the bars and clubs – finding 
something to do won’t be hard at all. Again, find out 
what is happening in the evening at your lodge or 
hotel first. If you aren’t interested, hit the streets. 
Almost everything is within walking distance in Aspen, 
and anything that is out of walking distance is 
accessible by bus or taxi. If you will be drinking, 
do not drive your car to the bar or club – find 
alternate transportation.

The Aspen Recreation center has many planned 
events throughout the season that are appropriate for 
adults and kids. However, if you are planning to bring 
the kids, but you want to enjoy some adult Aspen 
nightlife as well, child care may be available through 
your lodge or hotel.
