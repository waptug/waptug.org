Google Adsense: How to Write Great Blogs and Watch Your Adsense Dollars Add Up 

The best thing about blogging is that there are no rules.  You can write about anything you want.  A self-publisher’s dream!   There are some things you can do though to maximize your Google Adsense profits.  Narrow your subject.  Don’t just write about shopping.  Write about shopping for antique dresser drawer pulls.  Write every day. Have a blog at more than one site. If you develop a readership, you’re more likely to increase your profits.

Write about something you know or want to know or at the very least care about. If you try to write a great blog based on a “hot keyword” yet it’s something you could care less about, you’ll likely not stay with it long. Experiment and see what works for you. You can write based on your own opinion or something factual. You can review a product or service or a movie.  Read other people’s blogs and notice how many reads they’re getting.  Above all, have fun.  After all, it’s free and if you’re persistent you’ll see your Google Adsense dollars adding up.
