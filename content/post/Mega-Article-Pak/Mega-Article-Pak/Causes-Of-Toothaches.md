Causes Of Toothaches

When it comes to toothaches, there are many different things that can cause a toothache.  A toothache can come at any given time, even though you may not expect it.  The pain can be unbearable at times, and you’ll do practically anything you can to make the pain stop.  When a toothache first comes on, many of us start to wonder what caused it to happen.

Some of the main causes of toothaches include decay, a fracture in the teeth, and cavities.  A crack in the tooth is also a cause, although it can be difficult to diagnose, as cracks will normally appear to be invisible to the naked eye and x-rays.  Cracks can make your tooth feel as if it is exploding, as they expose the dentin and nerves to the air and anything else you put in your mouth.  If you don’t get them fixed, they will get worse, possibly leading to your tooth breaking off at the gums.

Pulp irritation is another cause of toothaches, as it occurs after dental treatment.  No matter how well your filling or crown was done, the materials that were used to fix the tooth can end up causing pain later on down the road.  There really is nothing you can do, as crowns can sometimes come off or the filling can sometimes come out.  If this happens, all you can really do is go back to the dentist to get the problem fixed.

If you have an exposed root or nerve, it can also be the cause of your toothache.  This normally happens due to rough brushing, receding the gums and exposing the root.  If the root is exposed, the air or liquid you drink can trigger a toothache.  To prevent this from happening, use care when you brush and never try to tear your gums apart thinking it will get your teeth cleaner.

If you use tobacco products, you’ll more than likely get toothaches on a frequent basis.  Chewing tobacco is a common contributor to toothaches and tooth pain, as the tobacco will eat away at your teeth until there is nothing left.  It doesn’t take long for it to happen either, especially if you have been chewing for a long time.  Smoking can trigger toothaches as well, as the smoke is bad for your teeth and eats away at them as well.

Even though there are many causes to toothaches, there are things you can do to stop and pain and prevent toothaches.  You should always brush your teeth on a daily basis, and go to the dentist for your regular checkups.  If you get a toothache you should always go to the dentist and get the tooth fixed.  The dentist may be able to catch it early enough to save the tooth - which will prevent you from having to get it pulled and save you a lot of money - and pain in the long run.
