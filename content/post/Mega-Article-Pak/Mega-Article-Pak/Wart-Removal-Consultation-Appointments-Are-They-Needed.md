Nowadays, it seem as if you always need to schedule a consultation appointment before undergoing a particular medical procedure, no matter how major or minor that procedure is.  While many of us associate consultation appointments with new patients, more and more healthcare professionals are making consultation appointments a regular occurrence, even for their regular patients.  This may leave you wondering whether or not a consultation appointment is needed for a simple wart removal.

Before you can begin to understand whether or not you will be required to schedule a consultation appointment, you need to keep one thing in mind. Not all doctors are the same.  In the United States, there are a number of different doctors who perform wart removals.  These doctors all have the ability to run and operate their business in anyway that they see fit. Essentially, this means that just because your neighbor was required to schedule a consultation appointment with his or her physician, it does not necessarily mean that you will be required to. 

When it comes to consultation appointments, dermatologists are more likely to require them than other doctors.  This is because dermatologists rarely end up treating their patients on a regular basis. This means that there is good chance that you are either a really old patient or a new patient. If this is the case, a dermatologist may wish to perform a consultation appointment first.  This consultation appoint may not only be used to examine the wart or warts in question, but it may also be used as an opportunity to express any other skin concerns you may have. So, in a way, a consultation appointment, if you can afford one, can be considered a good thing.  

As mentioned, not all healthcare professionals operate under the same rules and restrictions. To determine whether or not you will have to schedule and pay for a consultation appointment, in addition to the actual wart removal appointment, you are advised to contact the doctor that you plan on seeing. Their office should be able to give you an accurate timetable, as well as an estimated cost of service.  It is important that you learn this information upfront.  If treatment is too much for you to afford, you may have to look for alternative options; therefore, it is important that you get your questions answered before you are responsible for any services incurred.

Perhaps, it is also important to mention that you can choose any healthcare professional that you would like. For example, if your primary care physician would require you to schedule and pay for a consultation appointment and you do not think that one is necessary, you may want to think about finding another doctor, at least for the wart removal.  By contacting a number of local dermatologists or other primary care physicians, you should be able to find at least one professional who could treat you in one appointment.  This will not only save you time, but maybe even money.  

As you should be able see, consultation appointments, in most cases, are not necessary. Depending on how many warts you need to have removed, your healthcare professional should be able to examine the situation, as well as remove all of your warts, in one appointment. If you would like a consultation appointment or you would like to have yours eliminated, feel free to speak to your healthcare provider; the worst that they could say would be no.
