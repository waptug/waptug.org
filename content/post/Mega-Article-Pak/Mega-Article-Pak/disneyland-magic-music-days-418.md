Disneyland Magic Music Days

Disneyland has always contributed to the education 
of young people in one way or another. This tradition 
is continued with the Disneyland Magic Music Days 
program, which is an educational program for 
students of music, vocal arts, or dance. 

Your group has the opportunity to showcase your 
talent and to improve even more in a setting that 
promotes learning – and you can have fun doing it! 
The program is available all year, and is open to 
schools, studios, and other organizations worldwide. 
Auditions for the program are required. 

There are many workshops held to help improve the 
specific talents of each member of your group. These 
workshops are taught by professional actors, 
choreographers, comedians, dancers, composers, 
singers, arrangers, musicians, and conductors. 
Where else will your group have access to 
professionals in these fields – all in one place? To 
sweeten the pot, many of these professionals are 
famous in their fields, performing in both Hollywood 
and New York, among other famous places in the 
world.

Instrumental groups can audition to perform on one 
of the Disneyland stages. Marching bands can 
audition for the famous Disneyland parades. Along 
with performing in the happiest place on earth, 
which is an experience you will remember and talk 
about your entire life, you will also receive the 
benefits of world-class workshops, conducted by 
world-class professionals. Vocal groups and dancers 
audition to perform on one of the Disneyland stages, 
and are also offered the world-class workshops 
designed for vocalists and vocalist groups or dancers.

This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for your group. 
The performance alone will be unforgettable, but the 
information that these young performers will learn in 
the workshops is invaluable. Instrumental groups 
and marching bands will benefit from the 
soundtrack/instrumental workshop, the soundtrack
 jazz workshop, the tune in seminar, and the 
percussion workshop. 

Vocalists are offered the industry show choir 
workshop, academy show choir workshop, the 
academy vocal workshop, the industry vocal 
workshop, and the express yourself workshop. 
Dancers can take advantage of the industry dance 
workshop, academy dance workshop, and the 
express yourself workshop. There is something for 
all performers as Disneyland Magic Music Days!

Each member of each group will receive an 8 x 10 
glossy picture of their entire group, dressed in 
performance attire, in front of the Sleeping Beauty 
Castle. Although you won’t need any help 
remembering your time at Disneyland Magic Music
 Days, you can share this photo with your friends 
and loved ones when you return home from the most
unforgettable performance you will ever have!
