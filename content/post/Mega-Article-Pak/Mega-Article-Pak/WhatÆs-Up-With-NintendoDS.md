What's Up With NintendoDS?
A Guide of What's Available for the NintendoDS System

If you're looking for a game system that comes with a butt-load of inexpensive games, you come to the right place. No other gaming system on the market today hosts as many games at such low prices as the handheld NintendoDS System. Nor does any other gaming system on the market cater to such a young audience.

More appropriate for young gamers than teens or adults, NintendoDS games bring back the SuperMario flavor that we've all come to love. Pokemon is still as strong as ever with this system as well, however we've noticed a few new games (and types of games) thrown into the mix too. 

This article describes some of the accessories and games available for this particular sytem that everyone can enjoy.

The NintendoDS System. This isn't your regular GameBoy system of yesteryear. The new NintendoDS System has a high-powered flat, folding handheld gaming device complete with bright color touch screen technology - all available for only $129.99.

NintendoDS Accessories. Like the games that this system plays, its accessories are just as plentiful - fully appreciated by the serious gamer on the go. You can get a $14.99 headset for those quiet moments, and sport your system in a small $9.99 Duo game case, $9.99 ultimate leather case, or $17.99 G-Pak for quick trips or for storage. For $29.99, you can stock up on a multitude of accessories encased in a convenient player pack or settle for quick emergency fixes with the $14.99 value kit. Recharging is a breeze on a $9.99 glow deck.
