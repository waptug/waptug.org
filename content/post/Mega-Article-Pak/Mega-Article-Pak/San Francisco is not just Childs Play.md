San Francisco is not just Child's Play

Visiting San Francisco, California is great to do with a family; it is even better to do as an adult without children along. Frisco has a thriving nightlife and plenty of entertainment that simply isn't meant for children. From the slightly off color to the seriously bawdy, San Francisco nightlife has entertainment of almost every flavor. Of course there is still plenty to do during the daylight hours too.

If you're looking for a taste of nightlife that is 'belly busting' funny, there's Comedy on the Square that offers comedic variety shows. You can also check out Lila Theatre for some of the best long-form improvisation. If you need a good laugh these are great places to start. 50 Mason Lounge is also a great place to go to get in on the laughs. The problem with San Francisco is that there are so many great comedy clubs they can't all be listed in one place. My suggestion is that you ask around for suggestions and find out who's playing. You never know when someone you recognize might be popping in for the evening. 

In addition to the great comedy clubs there is the general 'gentleman's' nightlife alive and well in this fair city. I would be remiss if I failed to mention some of the more unique adult entertainment that San Francisco has to offer. In addition to the typical gentlemen's clubs such as Broadway Showgirls Cabaret, which boasts more luxurious surroundings than other clubs, there is Crazy Horse, Inc., which has totally nude live shows, The Gold Club, and Larry Flynt's Hustler Club. There is one club that goes above and beyond what any of these clubs offer though and is worth checking out with a date if you and your partner are so inclined. This club is called Power Exchange and while there are a few places like this around the country, they are extremely rare. If you aren't easily offended and are the least bit curious, I would recommend checking it out.

San Francisco is swimming with active and awesome nightclubs and as such it is quite difficult to single one out as superior to any other. I recommend finding a nightclub that is within walking distance of your hotel. This diminishes the odds of your driving while intoxicated. As always it is important to enjoy responsibly. 

If you want to make the most out of your trip to San Francisco, be sure to remember that while there is plenty to do at night, you want to be awake and aware for at least part of the day so don't have too much fun at night. If you are very brave and adventurous and looking for more adult only entertainment you can try one of the nude beaches in the area. While these beaches are not for everyone and they aren't exactly nighttime activities, they do offer some adult only entertainment that is worth considering if it floats your boat.

You can also rent sailboat and powerboat cruises in the bay, if you are with a loved one, try one of the sunset cruises. These cruises are romantic time away from the crowds of the city. Even if these times aren't exclusively for adults, if you close your eyes and imagine, you can whittle the world down to just the two of you.

Whatever your pleasure in this great city, I hope you have found some ideas for great fun and entertainment that will get your trip off to a great start. Remember to have fun and enjoy the time you spend visiting San Francisco, California whether that time be day or night. If none of the things I've mentioned above have struck your fancy there are always more cultural undertakings such as museums, guided tours, or trips to Alcatraz. Just remember the purpose of a vacation is fun, if you aren't having fun where you are, go somewhere else!
