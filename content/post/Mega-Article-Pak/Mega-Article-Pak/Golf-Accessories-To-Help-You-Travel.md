Golf Accessories To Help You Travel

If you are a die-hard golfer, you no doubt enjoy traveling to golf courses all around the world to practice your skills in places that are a little less familiar than the golf courses you usually spend your time at. When you travel to other parts of the country (or even other parts of the world) to play golf, you may have a hard time getting everything there easily and intact, and keeping everything sane for the whole time you are there. If you buy a few golf accessories beforehand, you can make things a lot less stressful on yourself. Here I will outline some of the things that will make your trip much easier.

First, you should purchase some sort of carrying case for your golf clubs. Having your expensive clubs smashed is never pleasant, and it is even worse when you planned your entire week around them. If you are flying to your destination then this tip will be particularly true. Buy a carrying case that will be strong enough and stiff enough to resist any crushing power that might attempt to smash your golf clubs. You can buy these strong bags at some golf stores, or online. Make sure that the one you buy is reinforced with some sort of metal material that will prevent it from caving in. You should put the case to the test before you rely on it to protect your clubs.

Another great way to keep your clubs safe is to purchase an ID tag to keep with your clubs. Include all of your contact information on it, as well as your cell phone number or the number of the hotel you are staying at. If you somehow lose your clubs in transit, it is a good idea to have them marked in a way that someone could return them to you if they were so inclined. There are still quite a few good Samaritans out there, so don’t give up all hope if something gets lost. You can make this tag yourself out of an index card, or you can buy an official one from a store. Fill it out with the most current information possible.

You should also include a few of the accessories that you usually take for granted. Include extra tees and golf balls, just in case you lose your main ones for some reason, or you can’t find the kinds you like at your destination. Small items like that have a particular tendency to get lost in luggage, so having extra will ensure that you have some once you get there. Spread them across a few different bags so that you always have a backup. It may seem extreme to do this, but you would be surprised at how frustrating it can be to have no golf balls or tees when you get to a new area.

If you are worried about losing your bag along the way, there is an option you might not have considered. There are many overnight shipping services created particularly for golfers that do not trust the airlines. One of the most popular ones, “ShipGolf”, will deliver your clubs to your hotel the very next morning. Of course they come with insurance so that if even the shipping service loses them you will be compensated. These can be a good choice if you have particularly expensive clubs.

Golf trips are a lot like the actual game that is played. The whole thing might be going according to plan, but then right near the end a really horrible shot ends up disrupting your mental flow. After that, it is almost impossible to get back in to line. This same thing applies to a golf trip overall Therefore it is good to be prepared for anything that might occur. As long as you are prepared, an undesirable event won’t cause the rest of your trip to be ruined.
