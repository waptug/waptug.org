One of the many benefits of requesting free beauty samples is that they are free.  Many times, you don’t even have to pay for the cost of shipping. Depending on who the free sample in question is being offered by, the product manufacturer or the retailer in question will ship the free sample to you free of charge.  When you look at it that way, what do you have to lose by requesting free beauty samples?

Another one of the many benefits to requesting free beauty samples is the products that you can find available. For starters, free beauty samples come in a number of different sizes, but you are often only given a free trail size. As for the actual free beauty sample, you will find that there a number of products for you to choose from. For instance, free beauty samples often include makeup, perfume, skincare creams, lotions, shampoos, conditioners, and so forth. No matter what you are looking for, in terms of a beauty product, you should be able to find some form of that product type available as a free sample.

Speaking of what you are looking for, that leads to another one of the many benefits to requesting free beauty samples.  Requesting free beauty samples is relatively easy to do. In fact, you have a number of different options.  One of the best ways to go about requesting free beauty samples is by using the internet.

You may want to visit the online websites of beauty product manufacturers, as well as beauty supply stores, as they often have free sample request forms on their websites.

You can also use the internet to find free beauty samples by visiting websites that are regularly referred to as freebie sites or free product sample websites. These websites are often in message board formats so that internet users can share free product samples that they come across online with others. What is nice about visiting a free product sample website is that you will not only find links to free beauty samples, but a wide range of other sample types, including books, movies, food, pet products, and baby products.

It may also be a good idea for you to visit one of your local beauty supply stores on occasion. While it is more common to find free beauty samples online, many beauty supply stores also offer free beauty samples to their customers or even those who just enter the store.  Since not all retailers offer in store free samples, you should not count on receiving them, but if you happen to be in or around a local beauty supply store you may want to look to see if they have any free beauty samples available for taking.

Perhaps, the greatest benefit to requesting free beauty samples or taking one when you find them in store is that you never really know what you may end up with.  Product manufacturers and retailers often offer free samples on their new products; therefore, it is likely something that you haven’t already tired before.

In fact, you may be so pleased with your recently acquired free sample that you decide to buy the full size product from then on out.

In addition to sending you a free product sample, it is common for a product manufacturer or a retailer to also include moneysaving coupons with your free sample. This is nice because should you like the product in question, you may want to buy the full sized product and your coupon may come in handy if and when you decide to do so.
