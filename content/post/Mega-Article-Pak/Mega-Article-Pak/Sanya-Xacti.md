Sany Xacti VPC-HD1

This digital HD media camera is small, elegant, and
also lightweight.  The Sanyo Xacti will beautifully
capture your memories in high definition.  The
stylish vertical design offered by the camera will
make it easier for you to keep an arm steady while
you shoot.

2.2" color OLED
The 2.2" flip out organic light emmitting diode 
screen will offer easier viewing of your recordings,
even in bright sunlight.

Video and pictures
The Xacti will simultaneously shoot 5.1 megapixel
still images and high definition video clips.  The
HD1 can also record over 21 minutes of 720 pixel
HD video on a single 1 GB SD care, or well over 42
minutes on a 2 GB card.

MPEG 4 format
The HD1 utilizes the high quality MPEG 4 recording
format which will deliver amazing video clarity and
detail.  With the files being conveniently small, 
you have the ability to record long, high quality
video clips.

Start up
When you close the LCD screen, the camera will go
into standby mode.  Open it back up, and you are
ready to shoot in as little as 2 seconds!  The
camera also records straight to SD flash memory
cards, so it will skip the long process of getting
the tape deck started.

Image stabilizer
The image stabilizer will accurately distinguish
between the unintentional camera shake and 
deliberate camera movement from pans or tilts.  It
will then compensate for the camera shaking to
give you more natural results when you shoot.

Zoom lens
The highly effective and bright 10x optical zoom 
lens witha maximum aperture of f/3.5 will allow you
to get up close to the action.  Coupled with a 10X
digital zoom, it will give you up to 100X of zooming
capabilities.

Scene modes
You can create breathtaking pictures with the HD1
by selecting the best suited mode to the subject.  
The scene selection mode will work for both still
images and video.  The modes to choose from include
sports, portrait, landscape, fireworks, and even
night view.

Easy playback
You can share your pictures and video clips with
family and friends in a snap.  Multiple connections
will allow for easy television playback, dubbing
to a VCR or DVD recorder, transfer to a PC for DVD
creation, editing, or just posting on the internet.

With everything the Sanya Xacti VPC HD1 has to 
offer, it's perfect for anyone looking for a HD
video camera.  You can do many things with this
camera, other than taking pictures or making videos.
If you've never experienced a HD video camera, the
Sanya Xacti is certainly one of the first ones you
should check out.
