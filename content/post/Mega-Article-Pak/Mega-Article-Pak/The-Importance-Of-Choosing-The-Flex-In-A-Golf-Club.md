The Importance Of Choosing The Flex In A Golf Club

When choosing a golf club, it is tempting to only focus on the things like length and weight. However, in order to choose the golf clubs that are best for your golfing abilities, you will need to carefully consider the flex of the shafts of the golf clubs you are looking at. Flex is an important factor in any golf club, but most beginners have a hard time wrapping their minds around the reason why. Here I will try to impress upon you the importance of the flex of a golf club. If you can understand why it works the way it does, you can start to buy golf clubs that work better for the goals you are trying to accomplish.

When you swing your golf club, there is a very imperceptible flex in the shaft. You won’t be able to notice it because you will be swinging at the time, but it is there. When you buy your golf club, it will have a flex rating assigned to it that will tell you everything that you need to know about the club. These ratings are extra stiff (X), stiff (S), regular (R), seniors (A), and ladies (L). You may think that it is not very serious to choose the wrong fled rating. When you strike the ball with a club that has a flex rating that you are not accustomed to, your shot is most likely to be angled in the wrong direction. This will cause nothing but frustration for you during your game.

To prevent this game-crippling turn of events, you should definitely be careful when choosing the flex in your shaft. There are certain traits that will always give away someone who should go for a stiffer rod. If your longer shots tend to always fly left of the intended target, this means that your golf club is most likely too flexible. The same goes if your swing is stronger than the average swing. If you swing the golf club extremely fast, chances are you would be better off playing your game with a stiff club. Just take the opposites of these things for the more flexible clubs – if your shots tend to veer to the right of if you have a slower swing, this is what you want to go with.

One way to determine what category you fit in is to go out to the driving range and hit the ball as far as you can. If your maximum drive is less than 200 yards, stick with an L flex rating. If it between 200 and 230, go with an S. Between 230 and 250, R. 250 or more, S. XS is usually only used by professional golf players, and doesn’t often come in handy for consumers. However, the rating system overall is a very good system and a great way for you to make sure that you are getting the golf club that you need. If you need more advice as to which rating you should choose, talk to some of the more experienced golfers around your favorite golf course and see if they can offer you any words of wisdom. The more personal advice you can get regarding the flex rating of your future golf clubs, the more likely you are to be happy with the choice.
