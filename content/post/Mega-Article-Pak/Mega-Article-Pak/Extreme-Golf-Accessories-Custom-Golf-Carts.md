Extreme Golf Accessories: Custom Golf Carts

There is no limit to the number of accessories that you can buy for golfing. You could spend thousands of dollars on small items that will hardly ever come in handy. However, you may not have had the idea of skipping all of those small accessories. Why not save your money for an extremely handy golf accessory that will continue to be useful throughout the whole game? A custom golf cart satisfies these requirements, and is arguably one of the best golf accessories that money can buy. It may not seem practical, but if you read on you will find out about the many ways that you can accomplish this, and how it can come in handy when you are hitting the golf course.

Golf carts are almost necessary for some of the bigger golf courses. If you are going to be hitting a huge golf course anytime soon, you will almost certainly need a golf cart in order to get from one course to the other while carrying all of your gear with you. You can rent golf carts from almost any golf course, but why rent when you can have your own for a cheaper rate in the long run? It is preferable because it allows you to buy a cart that has exactly what you want, and allows you to customize it in the future. The choices for custom golf carts far exceed those for the ones that you can rent, and you can get quite a luxurious setup going on.

The size of the golf cart can vary greatly. It is possible to buy one that is almost like an oversized go-kart. It will only hold you and your clubs, but it will be inexpensive and very efficient with gas. However, if you play golf socially then you will probably want to invest in a golf cart that seats 2 or even 4 people along with their gear. The power of the cart is also important. If the cart is fully loaded down and traveling along at a steady rate, will you immediately start to backslide when you start heading up a hill? This is very important to consider, especially with the hilly nature of golf courses. With most golf cart manufacturers you will not have much to worry about, especially if you stick with brands that are more well-known.

With your own golf cart, you can begin to make the ride more enjoyable, much the same way you would with a regular car. You can install a stereo system if you want to enjoy some tunes in between courses. If you are good with electronics like that, you could install a regular car stereo system in the golf cart without too much trouble. Just imagine being the only one on the golf course who is able to crank out music as loud as a rock concert. Sounds tempting, doesn’t it? You can deck out your golf cart with as many features as you could imagine, whether your goal is to make the ride more enjoyable, more efficient, or simply quicker. It can make a great ongoing project to add onto at later dates.

If you are interested in putting together a custom golf cart, you can either do it yourself if you are the engineering type, or you can contact a golf cart manufacturer. There are several companies that sell golf carts to individuals, and if you can get one as close as possible to what you want then it will be very possible to add features in the future. Make sure you are very clear on the cost and the methods of delivery when you begin to order your golf cart, so that you aren’t hit with any nasty surprise bills that you weren’t expecting. It’s definitely a big project to undertake, but if you have the time and money to do it then you will surely have a good time.
