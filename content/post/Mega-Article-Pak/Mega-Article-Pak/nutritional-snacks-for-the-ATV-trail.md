Nutritional Snacks for the ATV Trail

Could what you put in the ATV operator really make a difference on the ATV trail?  Absolutely; after all, you wouldn’t fill up your four-wheeler’s tank with maple syrup and potato chips. Filling up your own “tank” with garbage is just as likely to result in a negative outcome such as fatigue, gastrointestinal upset or distracting hunger pangs early on during a long ride.  

Want to know the secret to a long and happy ATV trail excursion?  It’s replacing all those sodas and juice bottles with clear and cool water. Though many ATV drivers swear by sports drinks, they might deliver too much sugar into your system.  Though sports and energy drinks are coveted by athletes who are exerting tremendous amounts of energy, you’re better off imbibing clear, pure and unflavored H2O.

What better food stuff than a handful of trail mix to go along with your thirst-quenching bottle of water?  Before you start munching on the various trail mixes available on the market, take heed.  Many of those so-called “healthy” snacks are loaded with trans-fats, unnecessary sodium, and far too much sugar.  Instead of trying to sort through all the supermarket options, why not make your own?  In a large plastic bag, throw in a cupful of a high fiber cereal, a half a cupful of nuts, a half a cupful of unsweetened dried fruits (such as cranberries, apricots, or raisins), and, if you must have something sweet, a modest sprinkling of semi-sweet baking chocolate chips.  Shake the bag and share with your ATV trail buddies.

Though many of the energy bars on the market are woefully lacking in basic nutrition, there are some which are hearty enough to eat as a meal substitute.  If you’re going to be out on your ATV all day, you can replace lunch with one of these power-packed energy bars.  Just make sure that your choice has at least 250-350 calories and a whopping dose of fiber.  Watch out for energy bars that are all carbohydrates; try to find one that balances carbs with protein. Try to avoid any that are made by popular candy makers because they usually contain way too high a proportion of sweetener.

One of the most underappreciated fruits is the lovely yellow banana, a tropical delight that packs a nutritional punch.  Though a medium banana is only about 100 calories, it is loaded with potassium and has reputedly therapeutic benefits.  If you can stow a few of these edible golden treasures in a place where they won’t get squashed during your ATV trail excursion, you’ll be able to benefit from their natural wealth of nourishment.  

Never forget that the more planning you put into your ATV exploration, the more you’ll get out of the experience. That includes the type, amount, and quality of foods you bring with you on your next ATV journey.
