Everything You Need to Know About the Strasbourg International Airport

France is one of the most popular vacation destinations in the entire world. This is due to the fact that France is home to a number of beautiful cities.  If you are planning on traveling to France, you will need to get there by air. To do so, you will have to find an international airport to use.  If you are traveling from the United States, you will want to find an international airport that is located close to your home.  When traveling to France, you will find that you also have a number of different international airport choices.  One of those choices is the Strasbourg International Airport.

Like many other well known, international airports, the Strasbourg International Airport is home to a number of popular and well known airlines.  One of those airlines is Air France. Air France regularly makes flights between France and the United States. Additional airlines that offer flights out of the Strasbourg International Airport, but not necessarily to the United States, include Austrian Airlines, Brit Air, Olympic Airlines, and Turkish Airlines. The previously mentioned airlines are just a few of the many that service this popular French airport.

Since the Strasbourg International Airport is an international airport, there are a number of air travel rules that passengers must follow.  If you are traveling to or from the Strasbourg International Airport, you will find that the air travel rules that you must abide by are not only the French air travel rules, but the rules of country that you are coming from. For instance, if you are traveling to France from the United States, you will also have to follow all American air travel rules, such as the ban on liquids or the ban on sharp objects, in your carryon luggage.  

Unlike most of the international airports in the United States, the Strasbourg International Airport has a relatively short check in time. In the United States, most airports recommend that their passengers arrive at least two hours before their flight is scheduled to take off. For international flights, the Strasbourg International Airport requests that you arrive, at least, thirty minutes before your flight is scheduled to depart.  However, that does not mean that you should wait until the last minute.  If you are unfamiliar with the Strasbourg International Airport it would be wise to give yourself time.

The Strasbourg International Airport, although popular, is a fairly small sized airport. For that reason, you will find a limited number of shops and restaurants.  Currently, the Strasbourg International Airport is home to six restaurants and bars and three retail shopping stores.  Although these numbers are fairly small, when compared to most other international airports, you will find everything that you need at these shops and restaurants.  

If you are vacationing in France, you will find that once you arrive at the airport or even when you want to leave, you will have a number of different transportation options.  There is a train that regularly runs from Entzheim to Strasbourg.  It is said that the train arrives within a short walking distance from the airport.  If you were looking for a direct pickup or drop-off, you will find that the airport has a bus shuttle service and tram service.   

In addition to the above mentioned retail stores and eateries, you will find that the Strasbourg International Airport provides travelers with even more.  If you are traveling with children, your children will likely enjoy the Europa Park.  The Europa Park is an onsite and indoor playground for kids. While your children are enjoying the playground, you could be reading the news online or checking your email.  This is because the Strasbourg International Airport is now setup with wireless internet.  As long as your laptop or PDA system is able to work wirelessly, you should be able to use it while waiting to board your flight.
