Security at Universal Studios Tours

If you are concerned about your safety while visiting 
Universal Studios, you should not be. There are 
security officers on the grounds, and security offices 
are located in the upper lot by Nick Stuff and in the 
lower lot inside the Jurassic Park Visitors Center.

After the 9/11 terrorists attacks, Universal Studios 
put a heightened security program in place. Today, 
security precautions are constantly taken for the 
safety of all visitors and guests. The park stays 
up-to-date on all security briefings that are issued 
by local and federal law enforcement agencies, 
and always takes appropriate measures to ensure 
everyone’s safety and well-being.

To date, there have been no major security issues at 
Universal Studios. The park has never been 
threatened by terrorists or nationals. In the event that 
the park is threatened, again, measures are in place 
to ensure the safety of everyone. With this in mind, 
enjoy yourself and all that Universal Studios Tours 
has to offer – leave the worrying to the people who 
are already equipped and prepared to deal with such 
an emergency, should it ever arise.
