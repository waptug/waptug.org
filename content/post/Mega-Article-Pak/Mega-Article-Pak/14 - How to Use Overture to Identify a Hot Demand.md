How to Use Overture to Identify a Hot Demand

The Overture Search Tool is a wonder to behold. There are so many tools and so much help available at the site that when you visit you will be asking why nobody has told you about this before now. The costs are small and the services are large and extremely helpful to Internet entrepreneurs.  It is free to join the site and there are so many ways for you to help yourself. You can locate the best keywords for your business you can find out what the top bid is on the best key words and you have to opportunity to place a higher bid. For only the very small price of $1.99 you can get even more help….and from professionals. 

There are a couple of differences to take note of, however. The free service gives you access to the STST. The way that overture will make a profit here, since the service is free, is by selling you the best key words. There’s nothing wrong with that…everybody has to make a profit to stay in business. The Keyword tool on Google gives a complete different set of Keywords. They don’t sell the keywords so it makes you wonder which list of Keywords are the best. 

If you have not yet made use of Overture, this is certainly a tool you should take the time to explore. Bidding very high on the best Keywords can move your advertisements into the top ten search results in the major search engines very quickly. 

We all know that search engine optimization (SEO) is the key to making sales and making use of Overture is one of the best ways to accomplish that task.  

Overture was originally named GoTo.com. It changed its name to Overture in October, 2001 and was purchased by Yahoo in 2003.
