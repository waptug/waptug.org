Fight Stress With Healthy Eating

Whenever we get too busy or stressed, we all tend
to make poor food choices that will actually 
increase stress and cause other problems.  To get
the most of your healthy eating and avoid stress, 
follow these simple tips.

Always eat breakfast
Even though you may think you aren't hungry, 
you need to eat something.  Skipping breakfast 
makes it harder to maintain the proper blood and
sugar levels during the day, so you should always
eat something.

Carry a snack
Keeping some protein rich snacks in your car, 
office, or pocket book will help you avoid blood
sugar level dips, the accompanying mood swings, and
the fatigue.  Trail mix, granola bars, and energy
bars all have the nutrients you need.

Healthy munchies
If you like to munch when you're stressed out, 
you can replace chips or other non healthy foods
with carrot sticks, celery sticks, or even 
sunflower seeds.

Bring your lunch
Although a lot of people prefer to eat fast food
for lunch, you can save a lot of money and actually
eat healthier if you take a few minutes and pack
a lunch at home.  Even if you only do this a few
times a week, you'll see a much better improvement
over eating out.

Stock your home
As important as it is to get the bad food out of
your house, it's even more important to get the good
food in!  The best way to do this is to plan a menu
of healthy meals at snacks at the beginning of the
week, list the ingedients you need, then go shop
for it.  This way, you'll know what you want when
you need it and you won't have to stress over what
to eat.
