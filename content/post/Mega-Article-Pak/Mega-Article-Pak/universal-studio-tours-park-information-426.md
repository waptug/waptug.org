Universal Studios Tours – Park Information

If you are planning a trip to Universal Studios Tours, 
you need to know specific information about the park 
before you arrive. If you have special needs, you may 
need more information than usual, and you should 
contact Guest Services and inform them of your 
special needs prior to your arrival.

You may purchase tickets in advance either online, 
or over the telephone. Tickets can also be purchased 
at Ticket Master Outlets and through travel agents. 
You may also purchase tickets at the gate. General 
one day admission costs $55, and those under forty 
eight inches tall are charged $45. Children under 
three are admitted free of charge. VIP Studio 
Passes are available on a limited basis, and are 
not available for children under the age of five. The 
cost for VIP Studio Passes is $149 per person. 
Annual tickets are also available, at a discounted 
rate. 

Universal Studios Hollywood is located in Los 
Angeles, California, at 100 Universal City Plaza. This 
is easily found right off of Highway 101, which is often 
called the Hollywood Freeway. The park is about 
ten minutes from the Los Angeles downtown area.

Only paid parking is available. It costs $10 for cars 
and $11 for recreational vehicles. You can also get 
preferred parking, which is closer to the entrance 
for $17. Free parking is not available on the Universal 
Studio grounds.

Realistically, it takes a full day to see all of the 
attractions in the park. However, if you don’t have a 
full day to spend at Universal Studios Tours, you 
should purchase the VIP pass, which will allow you 
to move to the front of the line for all rides and 
attractions. This cuts down wait times in lines 
significantly, and allows you to see all of the 
attractions much faster.

Don’t allow the rain to ruin your parade! The park 
remains open even when it rains, but if severe 
weather is an issue, many shows may be cancelled 
or relocated. In the event that the park must close 
due to whether, a rain check will be issued. A 
Universal Studio rain check will be issued if over 1/8 
of an inch of rain falls before 2pm, and it is good for 
thirty days.

Again, if you have special needs that may need 
special accommodations, please contact Guest 
Services by telephone prior to your visit. Some 
accommodations can take up to two weeks to 
arrange, so the sooner you contact Universal 
Studios Tours with your special needs request, 
the better the staff will be able to serve you.
