Yankee Candle Company

The Yankee Candle Company is known for providing quality candles in an array of colors and wonderful fragrances. They have been in business since 1969 when a young boy named Mike Kittredge made a candle from melted crayons as a gift for his mother. His friends and family members loved it, and he began selling them. 

Soon the demand for them was more than he could keep up with. Mike soon learned that the area in his parent’s home he was using to make the candles wasn’t large enough. He also learned he needed help to meet the supply demands. At the tender age of 19, he invested in retail space to make and sell his candles. 

In 1974, the business was moved into an old paper mill in Mike’s hometown of Hadley, Massachusetts. In 1983 the business relocated to a factory built in South Deerfield Massachusetts where it remains today. The company is a proud employer of more than 5,000 employees. These hard workers manufacture approximately 80 million candles each year. Customer satisfaction with their products has earned them the position as the Nations top candle designer manufacturer, and retailer in the industry. 

Customers are impressed with the selection of candles the Yankee Candle Company has to offer. The collection includes votives, pillars, and tea lights. Their most popular selling line is the jar candle. These are sold with a wick as well as with a burner that the jar sits on instead of using a wick. Once you know the style of candles you want, making a decision on the color and fragrance can be quite difficult. The company offers a free catalog featuring all of the selections available.
