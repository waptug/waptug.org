Aspen Nightlife – Aspen Center for 
Environmental Studies

Aspen Nightlife isn’t always about music and 
dancing. The Aspen Center for Environmental 
Studies is a great place to go at night! There 
are many planned activities related to 
environmental studies, and you shouldn’t miss 
the weekly Potbelly Perspective Series.

The Potbelly Perspective Series takes place 
one night each week, usually starting about 7pm. 
This is a lecture series presented by local 
people, as well as visiting guests. Adventures, 
pictures and stories are presented that are very 
interesting to anyone who has a love of nature 
or the environment. This series is not only 
interesting; it is also a very inexpensive way to 
spend an evening. Admission for adults is only 
$3.

Naturalist’s nights are also offered once each 
week. Here, you will learn facts about the 
natural world, and issues concerning the 
natural world. With expert speakers, many 
topics are covered, and these nights are planned 
in advance. This is a wonderful learning 
experience, and a great way to spend an evening 
in Aspen.

Many daytime programs are also offered 
through the Aspen Center for Environmental 
Studies, including ski tours and snowshoe tours. 
Call ahead to find out what events are planned, 
and to make reservations as necessary.
