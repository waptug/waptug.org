Formula D Racing Series Events and Venues

Formula D Racing, also commonly referred as a Formula Drifting, is a popular sport. That sport has recently started gaining popularity in the United States. In fact, a few years ago, a professional drifting series was created. This group of drivers and the series that they race in is sometimes referred to the Formula Drift Championship.  In the Formula Drift Championship, around fifty drivers compete to be known as the best professional drifter in the United States. Like all other professional racing events, these events take place in a series of different locations, namely professional race tracks.  

When it comes to all racing events, including Formula D Racing, you will find that it is hard to examine all of the different racing venues.  This is because they tend to change. As Formula D continues to rise in popularity, there is a good chance that additional tracks will be added, in the years to come.  However, you if you interested in learning more about the tracks which have already hosted an event, you are advised to pick a season and research those specific venues. For this article, we will focus on the 2006 Formula Drifting season.

Atlanta, Georgia is one of the stops on the Formula Drifting series.  Their events take place on Road Atlanta.  Road Atlanta is known as one of the best road courses in the United States.  In fact, it is also known on a worldly level.  In 2004, the staff at Road Atlanta added another horseshoe turn just for the Formula Drifting series.  This new paved turn helps to add extra excitement to the events being hosted at Road Atlanta.  In addition to Formula D Racing, Road Atlanta is also home to a number of other popular racing events. These events include, but are not limited to the AMA Suzuki Superbike Showdown, the Audi Driving Experience, and the Kevin Schwantz Suzuki School.  

The Formula Drift series also makes a stop in Sonoma, California.  That stop is to the Infineon Raceway.  The Infineon Raceway is popular due to its location.  It is located near the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco; in fact, it is located only thirty miles from there.  In addition to the Formula Drift series, the Infineon Raceway is also home to a number of other popular racing events. These events include, but are not limited to, NASCAR, drag racing, and the AMA Superbike tour.

Unlike the above mentioned tracks, Formula Drifting also takes place at Solider Field in Chicago, Illinois.  If you are familiar with Soldier Field, the football stadium, you may be wondering how drifting can take place there.  Despite what you may believe, the event does not actually take place inside the stadium; instead it takes place outside of it, in the parking lot.  During the Formula Drift event, the lot is transformed into an amazing drifting course.  Although it may not be on a track, the excitement is still the same, if not better.  One of the reasons why this event is so popular is because, aside from New Jersey, Formula D Racing usually does not usually come up to the mid or upper north east area.  

In addition to the above mentioned venues, the Formula Drift series also makes stops in Long Beach and Irwindale, California, Seattle, Washington, and Wall, New Jersey.  In Wall, New Jersey, the action takes place at the Air Force Reserve Wall Speedway.  In Long Beach California, the action takes place in the Streets of Long Beach.  In Irwindale, California, the events take place at the Irwindale Speedway.  As you can see, a number of these events are hosted at well-known racetracks and others are hosted in other locations, such as city streets or parking lots.  

As previously mentioned, the above mentioned venues were on the 2006 Formula Drifting circuit.  In the future, additional stops may be added and some of the above mentioned stops may even be eliminated. If you are interested in watching a live Formula D event, you are advised to obtain an up-to-date schedule for the year or years which you would like to attend.
