Custom Shutters

A lot of companies claim to sell custom shutters,
although they may actually be selling customized
interior shutters.  Customized types of shutters
will start as pre-built individual stock size
shutter panels, which are then cut down and hinged
together to achieve a specific size of shutter.

This will generally result in shutters that are a
poor fit for the windows of your home.  The 
shutters aren't proportional to the window size
and depending on how much of it was trimmed, the
panels themselves may also be compromised.

Synthetic shutters on the other hand, normally 
use pre-made stiles, rails, and louvers, then cut
them to size for quick production.  This can also
result in an improper fit and components that 
aren't in proportion to the window.

Other companies out there sell custom made shutters,
which are shutters specifically made from the start
for each individual window.  Even though this may
sound very nice, the results are normally those
you wouldn't want to display on your home.  With
your home being very important, the last thing
you want is shoddy shutters.

Custom made shutters are fabricated so that all
stiles and rails can be uniformed throughout the
house or office.  Even though they claim the 
custom made shutters are perfectly made for
your windows, it generally isn't the case

When you go out and purchase shutters, you should
always avoid companies that sell customized types
of shutters.  Instead, you should use the old
fashioned method and measure what you need, 
then go out and buy.

This way, you'll know exactly what you need to
buy.  You can select the shutters you like the
best, even those that match the interior or 
exterior of your home.  Before you know it, 
you'll have the shutters you've always wanted -
your way.
