Contact Lenses Without A Prescription

Even though you can get non prescription contacts, they aren’t meant to correct your vision.  Known as plano, the most common type of non prescription contact lenses are the opaque color contact lenses.  Even though they don’t require a prescription, those who want them need to consult with an optometrist first to ensure they get the right fit.

Locally or on the Internet, you can find many different varieties of non prescription contact lenses available.  You can find lenses that enhance the natural color of your eyes, lenses that enhance your look, and many others.  There are also Halloween contact lenses as well, which are great for Halloween or other times when you want to look different.

With non prescription contact lenses, you’ll have the choice of daily wear and disposable lenses.  If you are looking to change colors on a frequent basis, disposable lenses may be your best choice. The best thing about disposable lenses is the fact that you don’t need to clean them at all, simply wear them during the day then take them out and discard them at night.

If you are going to use the same color or the same pair of contacts for a while, you may want to go with daily wear lenses.  Daily wear contact lenses will last you a lot longer than the disposable lenses, although they will need to be disinfected and cleaned on a regular basis.  As long as you clean and disinfect them on a regular basis, they will last you for quite a while.

Without the supervision of a doctor, may doctors don’t advise the use of non prescription contact lenses.  Doctors will tell you that when they don’t monitor the fitting, usage of the contacts, and the overall effects, they may cause you serious problems and possibly even blindness.  While a lot of people use non prescription contacts, few of them experience serious problems.  

When an individual buys non prescription contacts without going to see an optician, they tend to forget the fact that contacts aren’t for everyone.  The amount of tears, shape of the eye, and need for correction varies from person to person.  To get the right fit, you must consult an optician, as he will need to carefully examine you.

Even though they may work great for some, non prescription lenses aren’t for everyone.  Anytime you use them, you should be very carefully and take the necessary care for your lenses.  If you are a diabetic, you’ll need to be very carefully, for the simple fact that eye infections will take a long time to heal.  Even though you may not get an infection, there is always a small chance that it could happen.  Therefore, you should always be carefully anytime you use these types of contacts.
