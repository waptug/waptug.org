Benefits Of CD Duplication

The process of CD duplication is the means of making
several copies of CDs of various types without
doing a replication of many.  The term is used to
describe the need and use of short run quantity
copying of various types of CDs.  Most CD
duplication is done for quantities under 500.

The value and quality of the duplicate is high, 
with the sound quality being very good and matching
the quality of the original.  There are many benefits
to CD duplication, including:
	1.  Its less expensive to do CD duplication
than it is to do a full replication, especially when
the demands are much lower.
	2.  In most cases, during a replication there
will be a minimum amount that is actually more than
needed.  By using CD duplication, you can actually
eliminate this extra replication.
	3.  Believe it or not, it can actually be
much faster to use CD duplication than a full CD
replication run.

There are other things that can cause you to take a
second look as well.  With most cases, CD duplication
will cost more per CD than that of a full run
replication. In the long run however, this may still
be much lower.  Not all will look like the original
either, as some will have blue or even black 
burn marks on them that make them appear to be
duplicates.

CD duplication, never the less, is a widely used
system of replicating CD's in a very effective and
timely manner.  The technology is always improving
as well, so you can look for updates in the quality
of CD duplication systems as well - which is great
news for those who enjoy CD duplication.
