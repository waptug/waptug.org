Characteristics Of The Golden Retriever

Almost all breeds of dogs are group oriented, as they need to interact with other species of their group to remain secure.  Golden Retrievers, in particular, have been bred over the years to be geared more towards people.  They make great guide dogs for the blind, friends for younger children, and even assistants for those who love to hunt.  Due to the way they have been bred, they need to interact with people on a frequent basis.

They are merciful dogs at heart, and will tolerate several mistakes from you all the while wanting nothing more than you to acknowledge the fact that they are there and pat them on the head.  Further proving that Golden Retrievers aim to please, is the fact that they were the first three dogs to obtain the Obedience Trial Championships - which is quite a statement indeed.

With Golden’s being so people oriented, it’s very important that they live with their owners.  When you do any type of family activity, you should make sure that your Golden is included.  Even though they don’t normally bark a lot, they will start barking if they get bored.  Once a Golden Retriever is fully grown and becomes stout, he will enjoy many types of activities such as hiking, walking, hunting, jogging, and many other types of physical activity.

If you start your Golden Retriever puppy out early with exposure to kids, he will grow to become better than ever will kids. Although they can be very friendly around young kids, they can still knock them over or tend to want to lick them in the face.  No matter how great your Golden Retriever may be around kids, you’ll never want to leave your dog and your kids alone.  Even though Golden’s have a great temperament, a child can accidentally poke him or pull his tail and cause him to retaliate via his natural instinct.

All Golden Retrievers love the water, and choose to get wet any chance they get.  If you have a pond or other source of water on your land, you can expect your Golden Retriever to get into it whenever he gets the chance.  They are also drawn to mud, and will get themselves dirty on a frequent basis.  Once your Golden is full grown, you can count on bathing him every couple of days.

During the summer, you’ll need to make sure that your Golden Retriever has plenty of moving air, shade, and water.  They like the heat, although it normally isn’t good for them.  As long as you take care of your Golden and don’t let him over exert himself, he should be just fine even in the hottest days that summer can dish out.
