Aspen Nightlife – Art Galleries

Aspen is famous for more than skiing. There are 
currently more than thirty art galleries in and around 
the Aspen area, where art created by famous artists 
around the world resides. Visiting the art galleries in 
Aspen is a must, and no Aspen vacation will be 
complete without this taste of culture.

Most of the art galleries are within walking distance 
of each other, arranged in a three by four block area. 
This area is located between Spring Street and 
Monarch Street, and Hopkins Avenue and Durant 
Street. 

You will find everything from vintage poster art at the 
Omnibus Gallery to Impressionism art at the Galerie 
Du Bois. Visit the Highline Gallery for glass art and 
the Pam Driscol Gallery for bronze sculpture art. 
Contemporary collections can be found at the 
Baldwin Gallery. 

While some galleries are open after hours, many 
close around 5pm. It is important to find out the 
operating hours of the galleries that you want to visit 
ahead of time. Many shows and events are planned 
at the galleries for the evening hours as well.
