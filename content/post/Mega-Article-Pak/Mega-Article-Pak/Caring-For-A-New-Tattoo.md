Caring For A New Tattoo

When you finally decide to get a tattoo, the first thing you’ll need to do is find a reputable tattoo artist.  Most tattoo artists have several designs that you can pick from.  If you don’t find anything you like, you can always ask him to make a custom tattoo.  You should always be careful in what you choose, as you’ll have the tattoo for the rest of your life.  The design is very important, although not nearly as important as taking care of it.

Good tattoo artists will also clean and apply antiseptic ointment to your tattoo as they create it.  Expert artists know that this helps keep the tattoo healthy.  Once the tattoo is finished, the artists will wipe it down, clean it off good, and apply another coat of antiseptic ointment.  Once the ointment has been applied, he will put a piece of soft tissue or cellophane over the tattoo.

Once the tattoo is finished, the artists should tell you how to take care of your new tattoo.  Some of the better artists will talk to you and give you a detailed sheet with all of the information you need.  If you went to a tattoo artist who didn’t explain this to you, you may be wondering just what you should do.  Taking care of a tattoo isn’t hard – as long as you know what you can and can’t do.

When you first get home with your new tattoo, you should never hop right in the shower.  You should keep it dry for the first few days, but also clean it every few hours.  Before you touch the tattoo or clean it, you should always make sure that your hands are clean.  If you keep your hands clean, you won’t have to worry about an infection.  

You’ll also want to visit your local drugstore and purchase a tube of A&D ointment.  A&D ointment is the best to use.  A&D will keep your tattoo clean and shiny and should be used for the first few days. Once the ointment starts to dry on the tattoo, you should wipe the old application off and apply some more.  Don’t rub it too hard, or you could damage the healing process.  For the first few days, you should avoid using soap as well.

After 5 – 6 days, you can quit using the ointment.  A&D ointment will keep your tattoo healthy, which you’ll notice the first time you apply it.  After you stop using it, you should use an unscented body lotion.  You want to avoid body lotions that have scents, as they can easily irritate the tender skin that resides under your tattoo.

After you have used the lotion for a few days, you can stop using it.  Most tattoos, after they have healed, tend to leave a scab in some areas.  If your tattoo has a scab, you should be careful when you try to pick it.  If you aren’t careful, you could end up damaging your design.  The best thing to do is you have a scab is to leave it alone.  You can put A&D ointment on it if you want, as most of the time a scab will itch.

A tattoo can be a great thing to have providing you take care of it. Tattoos will stay with your for the rest of your life, unless you choose to get them surgically removed.  Taking care of your tattoo now will keep it healthy and infection free in the long run.  If you follow the above advice on how to take care of your tattoo – you won’t have anything to worry about.
