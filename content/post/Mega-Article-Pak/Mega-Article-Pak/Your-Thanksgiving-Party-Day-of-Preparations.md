Your Thanksgiving Party:  Day of Preparations

Are you in the mist of planning a Thanksgiving party?  When it comes to Thanksgiving parties, a large amount of focus is placed on the planning and the preparation. While it is always advised that you plan and prepare for your party in advance, there are some things that just cannot be done until the last minute or, at least, the day of your party.  That is why it may be a good idea to familiarize yourself with the last minute party preparations that you will have to make.  

Depending on the size of your Thanksgiving party, you may need to make additional accommodations for your guests.  These accommodations may likely include seating arrangements.  If you need to set up additional tables and chairs, it may be a good idea to save that task until the day of your Thanksgiving party. This will prevent your home from being cluttered with additional tables and chairs; tables and chairs that may very well be in your way.  

Since a Thanksgiving party is not complete without Thanksgiving decorations, there is a good chance that you will be decorating your home.  If you do choose to decorate your home, for your Thanksgiving party, you may want to leave the decorations until the last minute.  Of course, you can always put your decorations up early, if you want to, but there are a number of benefits to leaving them down until the day of your party. Those benefits include the lack of dust that will accumulate on those decorations and the less likelihood of them getting damaged before your party even begins.

If you decided to incorporate a Thanksgiving dinner into your Thanksgiving party, you may have prepared some of your foods and side dishes early. While you can prepare a number of dished in advance, there are some that need to be made at the last minute. Whether you are cooking a turkey or preparing a fresh salad, you may need to do your cooking on the day of, likely the morning of, your party.  Even if you are just serving snacks and drinks at your party, you will want to wait until that day to start setting them out.

Another task that you may want to leave until the day of your party is the cleaning of your home. While you can also start to prepare your home a few days before your party is set to take place, there are some cleaning tasks that you may want to leave until the last few hours. These tasks may include a quick dusting, as well as a quick vacuum.  Waiting until the day of your Thanksgiving party to sweep or vacuum your home will help to ensure that your home is as clean as it could possibly be.  

In addition to the above mentioned tasks, you will likely find that there are number of other tasks that you may like to complete on the day of your Thanksgiving party. If you are currently in the planning stages, it may be a good idea to develop a party checklist or a party planning schedule.  This may make it easier to decide what you should and shouldn’t save until the day of your Thanksgiving party.  In addition to giving you a set schedule to follow, you will also likely find that planning your party ahead of time, even at the last minute, will make it easier for you to enjoy yourself, even before your Thanksgiving party begins.
