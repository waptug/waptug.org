Chase.com credit card 
Chase.com credit card offers



Online credit card applications seem to be the in thing and Chase too offers online credit card application facility. Here, â€˜Chase.com credit cardsâ€™ refers to the chase credit cards that can be applied for online. Just for those who donâ€™t know, â€˜Chaseâ€™ is a brand that is owned by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (a leading global financial services firm). 

By â€˜Chase.com credit card offersâ€™, I mean the credit card offers that are available at chase.com. Obviously, â€˜Chase.com credit cardsâ€™ would be regulated by chase. Again, as with any other credit card supplier, â€˜Chase.com credit cardsâ€™ on offer would be changing too.  

Anyways; one night, before going to bed, I thought of just checking the chase.com credit cards section. Here is what I found:

There is a separate Chase.com credit cards section. As I browsed through the Chase.com credit cards section (the online application ones), the first one I encountered was called â€˜Chase Cash Plusâ€™ or the â€˜Chase Cash Plus Rewardsâ€™. These promise faster rewards and offer 5% earnings on gas and on purchases made at grocery-stores/drug-stores. For other shopping venues, it offers 1% earnings. These earnings can be in the form of gift certificates or cash. 

The next on the Chase.com credit cards section was the â€˜Flexible rewards Visa signature cardâ€™. Here you earn a point for every purchase of $1. You can keep collecting these points and then finally redeem them for your choice of things (like cash, travel, gift certificates or some kind of merchandise). The redemption can start at 2500 points (and you get a bonus of 1000 points once you make the first purchase). Moreover, this one doesnâ€™t have any annual fee either. So that was the second one in the Chase.com credit cards section. 

Moving on in the Chase.com credit cards section, I found â€˜Free Cash Rewards Platinum Visa cardâ€™. This one, as the name goes, offers cash rewards. You can get a $25 check or a gift certificate on redemption of 2500 points. Since there is one point earned for every $1 spend, this mean that you effectively get 1% cash back on these cards. 

I had started loving browsing through the Chase.com credit cards section. So I moved on to the next one in the Chase.com credit cards section. The next one on the Chase.com credit cards section was â€˜Chase Perfect Platinum MasterCardâ€™ which doesnâ€™t limit you to getting rebates only on a particular brand of gasoline; instead, you get rebates everywhere. â€˜

Chase Platinum MasterCardâ€™ was the next one in the Chase.com credit cards section. This one offers online account management i.e. monthly statements, bill payments etc can all be done online (also you donâ€™t have any annual fee on this one). 

There were few more cards on Chase.com credit cards section and one especially caught my attention. This one was at the bottom of Chase.com credit cards section and was called â€˜Check Gallery Platinum Visa Cardâ€™. Here you could choose the design of your card from those available e.g. cowboys, smileys etc. 

By now, I was so sleepy that I really had to shut down my computer and go off to sleep.
