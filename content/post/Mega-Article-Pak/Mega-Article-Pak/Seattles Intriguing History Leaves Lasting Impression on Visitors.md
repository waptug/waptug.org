Seattle's Intriguing History Leaves Lasting Impression on Visitors

Seattle, Washington has a great deal to offer its discerning visitors. From the ordinary and mundane to the out and out macabre, you will see it all while visiting Seattle, Washington, if, that is, you know where to look for them. Seattle has a rich history and it seems an even richer future. Nestled among some of the most beautiful countryside North America has to offer, this great city has the best of most worlds-a very mild climate, access to water, land, mountains, fields, and streams. Seattle is like every patriotic song you can imagine and in the middle of it all Seattle is a bustling metropolis. 

If you are planning to visit Seattle, I have one word of warning for you. You will probably want to stay. That is of course, if you aren't too worried by rain. The only real drawback I can see for living in Seattle is that your skin will have a difficult time getting that sun kissed glow that summer brings almost everywhere else in America. But I think I could sacrifice sweltering heat and sticky humidity in exchange for a little rain. In fact, I would welcome a little rain right now; it might actually cool things off. 

For those who have tastes that run a little bit off center of ordinary, Seattle has a great bit of entertainment to offer you as well. The first bit is a freebie and not of interest to some (yet it still seems a vastly popular stop for tourists). That place is the Lakeview Cemetery. This is where the bodies of many of Seattle's founding fathers and most prominent citizens have been laid to rest. Perhaps most startling is the fact that Bruce and Brandon Lee receive more visitors than anyone else in the cemetery. While some may find this fact mildly disturbing, I guess when you think of all the visitors Graceland receives every year it really isn't all that obscene. 

The next stop on the off center tourist traps would be Bill Speidel's Underground Tour. This tour takes you to the streets of old downtown Seattle. The only thing is these streets are beneath the streets of New Seattle. This is perhaps one of the most interesting tours you will find in the city-other than maybe the Private Eye tours but that's another story-because it literally takes you into history. At the end of this tour you can get access to Rogue's Gallery Museum where you will see exhibits relating to Seattle's Victorian era and other historical points of interest. The tour lasts about 90 minutes and costs $11 for adults. If you have the time, this is one tour that if nothing else, will leave a lasting impression.

If you are in the Pike Place Market area, you really should check out the Market Ghost Tours. These are one hour walking tours of the market where those who work in the building share stories of strange occurrences. You will also get to hear some of Seattle's interesting history mixed in with the ghost tales. This is a walking tour and might be a little frightening and/or boring for smaller children. But, if you are looking for something different to do, this tour should be right up your alley. Whether you believe in ghosts or not, I would hope that you can at the very least find tours such as this entertaining. 

The city of Seattle has a great deal to offer those who are adventurous enough to seek the knowledge, fun, and entertainment that abounds. Some of the tours and exhibits need to be taken with a grain of salt and a sense of humor. All others should at the very least provide some degree of information, education, and fun to those who visit. I hope more than anything that your trip to Seattle takes you off the beaten path at least once. What on earth would you tell the people back home if you didn't at least have one extraordinary adventure?
