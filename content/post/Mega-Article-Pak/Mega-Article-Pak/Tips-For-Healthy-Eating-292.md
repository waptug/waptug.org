Tips For Healthy Eating

Healthy eating is a way of balancing the food you
eat to keep your body in great health.  With healthy
eating, you'll have energy all day, get the vitamins
and minerals you need, stay strong for activities
you enjoy, and maintain a healthy weight.

Below, you'll find tips designed to help you with
healthy eating.

1.  Don't skip any meals
Eating 3 meals with snacks in between is the ideal
way to maintain both energy and a healthy weight.
When you skip meals and get hungry, you're more
than likely to choose foods that aren't very good
for you.

If you are eating away from home, take food with 
you or know where you can buy healthy food from.

2.  Learn about how to prepare foods
Instead of deep frying, try grilling, stir frying,
microwaving, baking, and even boiling.  You should
also try fresh or even dried herbs and spices to 
add flavor to your food.  Before you eat any type
of meat, be sure to trim the fat and skin off of 
it.

3.  Avoid a lot of sugar
Drinks that contain sugar are a major source of
empty energy.  What this means, is that the drinks
contain a lot of energy that your body may not
need, and it doesn't contain any vitamins or 
minerals.  If you plan to drink sugary drinks,
don't go overboard - limit yourself to 1 a day.

4.  Avoid thinking about diets
There are no good food nor any bad foods.  All 
food can be a part of a healthy diet, when eaten
in moderation.  You don't need to buy any low 
carb, fat free, or even diet foods, as these foods
normally have lots of other added ingredients 
to replaces the carbohydrates or fat.
