Snow Boarding Holidays

OK so have you ever been on a snowboarding holiday? If so, then you must have enjoyed yourself. The thing about Snow Boarding is that absolutely everybody can enjoy it regardless of their ability. When I first went on a snow boarding holiday it was with my friends and they had all been snow boarding already. This was something that I had never done before, and I was obviously nervous about whether or not I could really enjoy myself when I had absolutely no experience on a board.

But the fact is that I enjoyed it just as much as them, if not more! When you get behind a board something special happens, that I cannot explain. When you are going down a slope, no matter how small, you feel something special when you start to speed up and the acceleration just hits you. I went on the starter slope with my friend who had also never been snow boarding before, but we really enjoyed ourselves. We were firstly given instructions and training by a girl who was an experienced snow boarder. She basically gave us all the hints and tips that we would need to hit the slopes ourselves.

After we had been given the training we also got taught one of the most difficult parts of snow boarding. Yes guys, you guessed it – How to get to the top of the hill on our own. It is really difficult because if you miss-time getting on the lift then you could fall, and if you miss-time getting off the lift then problems can happen just as easily. This is what I always noticed when I was snowboarding because I actually used to get really nervous before I approached the lift. Getting off a snow boarding lift is probably just as difficult for a beginner.

Now let me tell you more about what you can actually get up to on a snow boarding holiday. There is so much to do that it is unbelievable but what I really enjoy the most is how relaxing they are, if not tiring!

You get up in the morning and if you are staying at a hotel, then you really should try and get as big a breakfast as your stomach can handle! Next it is time to hit the slopes, and that it the part that takes up most of the day. When you are deciding what slope to go to you should ask people what slope they prefer and what kind of slope they enjoy. For me this was simple, as I was just a beginner. But as the week went on I did start to get a little braver I have to say. After you have spent your day snow boarding, there is usually lots that you can do on a snow boarding holiday. For a start, you can think of activities that you would do back home. Me and my friends are from the states and we had never been allowed to drink before. So when we went to Europe and we were 20 we could not wait to sample drinking in clubs and pubs around the slopes. This was so much fun, and I have to say that apart from the snow boarding this was the best part of the holiday.

A lot of people ask me if you have to hire out a snow board to go snow boarding on a snow boarding holiday but this is not the case at all. You can easily rent one out when you are over here and it really will not be that much cost at all. My friends are all snow boarders and they decided to hire out snow boards because it actually worked out cheaper than the cost of flying them over on the plane. Whatever you do go on a snow boarding holiday and I am sure that you will really enjoy yourself if you are anything like me.
