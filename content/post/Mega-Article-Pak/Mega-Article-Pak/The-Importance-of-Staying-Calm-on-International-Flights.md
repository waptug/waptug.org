The Importance of Staying Calm on International Flights

Each day, a large number of American citizens hit the sky.  While many are only traveling from one state to another, there are some who are traveling from one country to another. If you are one of those individuals, you may be nervous, rightfully so.  If you are a first-time flyer or if you have a problem with flying in general, it is advised that you learn to calm your nerves as much as possible. Although it may seem impossible to do, there are a number of benefits to doing so, namely for your own safety.

Unfortunately, in today’s society it seems as if air travel has gotten a little bit out of control.  Airport security, airline personnel, as well as other passengers, are all concerned with their safety. While it is important to be concerned with your safety and the safety of others, it is seem as if what it takes to make everyone feel unsafe has also gotten a little bit out of control. If you are on an airplane, especially on an international flight, and someone carelessly mentioned the word bomb, your flight would probably land at the nearest airport. The same can be said for uncooperative passengers. That is why it is extremely important that you remain calm, aboard an airplane, at all times.

Many travelers are nervous about flying, all on its own, however, others display a wide array of emotions for other reasons. One of those reasons is dissatisfaction.  On international flights, like all other flights, you will find that your actions are limited in the air. There are only certain times when you can remove your seatbelts, use the bathroom, or use your electronic equipment. If these times do not meet with your schedule, you are advised to just deal with it. Becoming upset or hysterical will not accomplish anything for you; expect for maybe a date with local authorities at your next stop.

One of the number one reasons why trouble begins on a plane, even if is innocent enough as being scared to fly, is because travelers do not know the consequences of their actions. A nervous, jittery, or confrontational passenger is what flight attendants are taught to look for. Although you may not be a terrorist, you may be displaying noticeable symptoms. In the event that this does happen, your plane will likely be rerouted, where you and other passengers will be met with airport security or local authorities.  Depending on what your actions involved, you may be charged with disorderly conduct or something similar. Essentially, this means that it is extremely important that you remain calm at all times.

In addition to remaining calm aboard an international flight, it is also advised that you remain calm at the airport. All international airports are on high alert. This means that they will not only be looking for prohibited items, but suspicious travelers as well.  If you are nervous about flying, you need to think of something enjoyable; it may help to calm your nerves. If you are asked to do something by airport security, such as step aside, you are advised to do so. If you do not, it is likely that a confrontation could brew.  Starting a confrontation in airport is just as serious as starting one in the air.  In fact, you will likely be met with the same consequences, as mentioned above.

Although it is important to know what could happen to you if you fail to remain clam in an international airport or aboard an international flight, is it is also important to work on ways to stay calm.  Whether it involves thinking happy thoughts, bringing along headphones, or by taking long deep breaths, it is advised that you develop multiple ways to keep yourself calm and level headed.  If you fail to do so, you may regret your decision to fly for the rest of your life and that is something that shouldn’t have to happen.
