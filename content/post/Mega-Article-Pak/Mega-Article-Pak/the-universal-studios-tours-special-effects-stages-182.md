The Universal Studios Tours Special Effects Stages

When you visit Universal Studios, the Special 
Effects Stages is an attraction that should not be
missed. This is not only a great way to learn and 
understand how special effects are done in the 
movies; it is also a great deal of fun. It is really 
quite interesting to see how it all comes to life in 
Hollywood!

There are three Special Effects Stages: The Virtual 
Studio, The Creature Factory, and The Sound Lab. 
Remember that this is an interactive attraction, so 
you will be able to create your very own special 
effects. You will learn many of the special effects 
secrets used in major movies, such as The Hulk, 
The Mummy Returns, Jurassic Park, and many 
others. There are Universal Staff members 
available to help with the effects.

The special effects stages are not designed for 
people who have medical conditions that may be 
affected by strobe lights, or anything resembling 
strobe light effects. People with sensitive ears 
should avoid this attraction, or bring and use 
earplugs. The Special Effects Stages are located 
on the lower lot at Universal Studios.
