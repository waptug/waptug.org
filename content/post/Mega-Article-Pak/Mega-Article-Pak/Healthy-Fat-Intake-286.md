Healthy Fat Intake

This information is aimed at helping you to 
reduce your fat intake.  The average individual
eats too much fat, a factor that's linked to
a variety of health problems, including cancer.
Diets that are high in fat are associated with
breast and colon cancer, with some studies 
linking high fat to prostate cancer as well.

A majority of people can bring their fat intakes
down to a healthy range by making a few adjustments
in the way they shop, cook, and prepare the foods
they eat.

Now days, it's getting easier and easier to control
the amount of fat you consume.  The fat content of
foods are now available through the nutrition label
and through brochures distributed by food companies
and even fast food restaurants.

You can use this information on nutrition to choose
lower fat foods by comparing products and food 
brands.  Once you have a rough idea of what a healthy
intake of fat is, you'll know what you can and what
you can't have.

From day to day, the amount of fat you eat will
vary.  Some meals and some days will be higher in
fat than others.  Even high fat meals can be kept 
in line with healthy eating as long as you balance
those days accordingly.  The average fat intake over
the course of weeks and months is important, not the
fat intake of every meal and food you consume.

Younger adults and high active adults who have 
higher calorie needs can probably eat a little more
fat.  Older adults and those that aren't very active
should aim for a lower fat intake.  This way, you
can control your fat intake and avoid the many 
problems that fat is associated with.
