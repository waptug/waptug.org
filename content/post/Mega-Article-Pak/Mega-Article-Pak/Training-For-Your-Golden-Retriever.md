Training For Your Golden Retriever

With the term training in mind, there are several different meanings involved.  When you are looking to train your Golden Retriever, you have a few options available to you.  Below, we will take a look at the many types of training for your Golden, and help you decide when type of training is best for both you and your Golden.

Behavior training
Behavior training teaches a Golden Retriever to be a good dog in general.  The training involved includes house breaking, good general behavior around people and pets, leash training, and other types of things that will make him a better companion.  Dogs that who passed obedience training and well composed - no matter where you decide to take them.

Activity training
Activity training teaches Golden Retrievers various activities such as hunting, herding, search and rescue, and several other tricks that you can do together.  Activity training is very popular with the Golden breed, as it helps to make the relationship between you and your pet a lot more interesting.  By concentrating on activities that the Golden breed was bred to do, activity training is always very beneficial to your Golden Retriever.

Obedience training
Obedience training teaches your Golden how to perform various activities.  This type of training focuses on general behavior as well, teaching the dog to be well behaved.  Most dogs who go through a class in obedience training turn out to be well behaved and will listen to your commands and shouldn’t do things such as chewing and barking for no reason.  If you want your Golden to be well behaved and obedient, you should enroll him in a obedience training class as soon as you can.

Keep in mind that there are certain lines and distinctions with each type of training. If you choose obedience training for example, then your Golden Retriever won’t get any help with his behavior.  When you select a class for your Golden, you always want to select a class that fits his needs at that time.  If you are having trouble controlling your dog, you may want to start him off with behavior training, which is what most Golden owners tend to do.

When you look for a training class, you should also know what area your dog needs help with.  Sometimes, a behavior pattern can be the result of boredom, which can easily be fixed by spending more time with your dog.  Once you have spent more time with him, you’ll sometimes notice his patten to stop.  Other times however, he may need a bit more help with certain behavior patterns, which is where training comes into play.  Although Golden Retrievers are smart dogs, they won’t know if they are doing something wrong unless you show them.

Before you can train your Golden puppy, you need to know what to teach him.  Golden puppies adore routines, and feel more at ease than ever if they are on a schedule that they can predict.  When you take your dog to training, you should always be patient with him and reassure him that he is doing good.  As your Golden gets older and begins to learn new things, he will never forget his training.  In the unlikely event that he starts to slip on some of his training, you can always let him go through a course again to brush up on the techniques.  This way, no matter how old your Golden Retriever gets, he will always be the ideal companion that you have grown to love over the years.
