Protecting Your Health While Aboard a Cruise Ship

When it comes to cruise ship safety, there are many individuals who are concerned with their physical safety.  Physically staying safe aboard a cruise ship is important, but so is staying healthy.  Due to a large number of individuals in a fairly small space, cruise ships have a number of health concerns. 

The health problems and concerns found on cruise ships are often highly publicized.  Despite this publicity, most cruise ships are fun, safe, and clean.  Being concerned with your health aboard a cruise ship is one thing, but you should not let it prevent you from enjoying your vacation.  Rather than letting the fear of getting sick ruin your vacation, you should take a few simple steps to ensure that your health will be the same as, if not better, when you first boarded.

Before your cruise ship is scheduled to set sail, you are urged to schedule a visit with your family physician.  Be sure to inform him or her that you are planning a vacation aboard a cruise ship.  Your physician will likely check your health to make sure you are fit for travel.  In addition to examining your general health, it is possible that your physician may require a number of immunizations.  These immunizations may offer you extra protection; therefore, you are urged to obtain them.

If you are taking multiple medications at the time of your cruise, you will want to make sure that you have an adequate supply.  If you are running low on your medication, you may want to obtain a refill before you leave for your cruise.  It is also likely that your doctor may request that you bring along extra medication.  This request is often made to individuals who must take their medications to survive.  In the event that you misplace your medication, you will have an extra supply to fall back on.

Taking health precautions before you board the cruise ship is important.  However, it is also important to take precautionary measures after you board.  These measures are simple; however, they may be vital to your health.  One of the first things that you should do is familiarize yourself with the layout of your ship.  Determining whether or not there is a doctor onboard and where they are located is important.  

Since germs and illnesses spread easily aboard cruise ships, you will need to protect yourself.  This protection involves washing your hands on a regular basis. When most individuals are at home, they wash their hands after completing certain activities.  In addition to eating and using the restrooms, you should wash your hands after using all public facilities.  If you find it difficult to wash your hands regularly, you may want to obtain a package of disinfecting wipes.  If used properly, disinfecting wipes can be just as effective as soap and water.

Cruise ships are popular for their relaxing atmosphere.  This relaxation may include lounging.  When lounging or taking a stroll, it is advised that you keep your shoes on at all times.  As previously mentioned germs can easily spread aboard a cruise ship.  Keeping your feet covered at all times will not only protect you from contagious illnesses, but it will prevent you from stepping on harmful objects.  

In addition to cruising along water, most cruise ships dock in a port. It is likely that you will be visiting a foreign country.  In the event that you end up on foreign land, it is important that you carefully monitor what you eat and drink.  If you notice drinking advisories, you are urged to follow them.  Instead of drinking tap water, you may want to opt for bottled water or another bottled beverage.  Many individuals are concerned only with the drinking water, but you should also be concerned with ice cubes and water in uncooked foods. 

As you can see, the above mentioned precautionary measures are simple and easy to follow.  Why put yourself at risk for illness; especially when it requires little or no effort to keep your health in good standing.
