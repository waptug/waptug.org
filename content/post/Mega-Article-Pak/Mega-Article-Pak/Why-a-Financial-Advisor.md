Why a Financial Advisor?

Many people will readily and admittedly seek the services of legal professionals, medical professionals, tax professionals, even domestic professionals but when it comes to financial planning, they rarely seek the assistance of financial professionals. Perhaps it's the result of our grand parents generation and a fundamental lack of trust when it comes to sharing our financial situation with others. But could it be that this is one area where we are simply afraid to admit that we do not hold the answers? It's money after all; we should be able to control it, where it's going, and what it will do when it gets there right? I'm afraid the answer to that would be, "Not exactly."

Just as the tax codes in this country have become so complicated that you need a magic decoder ring in order to sort through them and actually pay your taxes, so have the rules and regulations when it comes to setting aside funds for the specific purpose of financial retirement planning. One of the reasons they are so complicated is because that many of the plans have very unique and very specific tax benefits either before or after the money is received. In other words, don't put away those magic decoder rings too quickly. You may need them in a few years.

The bottom line is that a good financial planner can help you navigate your way through the treacherous territory of taxes in relation to your financial planning and so much more. Most importantly however, a good financial planner can clue you in to opportunities that you may not know about or may not know enough about. It is their business to know about the many opportunities that exist to set aside and make money for you and your family. 

A good financial planner can help you plan for so much more than retirement. In fact, a very good financial planner can help you plan for your retirement, the college funds for your children, emergency funds for life's little mishaps, and a little bit to put towards those special purchases we like to make along the way.

They can do all the things mentioned above by assessing your current situation, your future needs, your current means, and your future goals. They will discuss spending issues that may be problematic, make suggestions, and help you come up with a realistic plan for meeting your goals. Their work doesn't stop there however. They will monitor your progress and when necessary make adjustments that will help you get back on track with your financial planning.

Many people feel that they are perfectly capable of doing this on their own and the truth of the matter is that some people are. The vast majority of us however, lack the discipline, willpower, and the knowledge of investment strategies to make nearly the return on our investments that a good financial planner will yield. When planning your financial retirement and the future of your family you should keep the bottom line in mind at all times. If a good financial planner can net you $100,000 or more in retirement funds over time, he's well worth the price you pay for his service.

Some of the best things about a financial advisor is that you won't have to pay the sometimes high price that comes with learning from your mistakes. You will have his or her knowledge and experience working for your money rather than your own inexperience risking it. He or she can also help you with estate planning and tax guidance so that you aren't left floundering in these matters. He or she can also help you determine your insurance needs in order to protect those you leave behind. There are many ways that a decent financial planner can help you maximize your retirement money the hardest part for you as the consumer is making the call.
