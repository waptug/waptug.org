Hot Selling Items for eBay Auctions

Many people who are trying to start an eBay 
business spend a great deal of time trying to figure 
out which items sell the best on eBay. Many of these
 people have elaborate systems for determining this 
information, and many others purchase expensive 
courses that teach them how to find this information 
as well. None of that is necessary. Everything you 
need to know is right in front of you – on the eBay 
website!

Take a look at any category, and you will see the 
word ‘hot’ beside some items. These items are not 
marked as hot sellers randomly – there is a method 
to the madness! Items only get marked as hot when 
there have been more than thirty bids placed on 
the item. All you have to do is wonder around the eBay 
website for a while to find an item that will do well. 

However, most power sellers will agree that there is 
more to figuring out which items sell best than this. 
In fact, they claim that it is a science. A great way 
to start your search for items that will result in a 
successful auction in the future is to do research on 
the auctions that were successful in the past. You 
can view old listings that have completed at:
http://listings.ebay.com .

A new way to determine what items sell best on 
eBay is ‘eBay Marketplace Research.’ Marketplace 
Research will allow you to view important statistical 
information on the buying trends at eBay. This 
product contains all of the data one could possibly 
ever need to determine how well – or how poorly – 
an item will do in an eBay auction. There is a small 
fee for using the eBay Marketplace Research tools, 
however.

Another tool that will be very useful in your quest for 
finding hot selling items for your eBay auctions is the 
listing of popular eBay search terms that is found on 
the site. This list can be found at: 
http://popular.ebay.com/ . This list is divided into 
categories, which will make it easier to determine 
how popular your potential item may be. 

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that an item will 
do poorly, or that it will do well without doing your 
homework on the item first. Some of the strangest 
things sell for the highest prices, while items that 
would sell quickly in any other environment just sit 
there. Almost any eBay Power Seller will tell you 
that the key to a successful auction rests in the 
amount of research you put into the items you 
hope to sell.
