Family Vacations Aboard Privately Chartered Yachts

Are you and your family in the process of planning a family vacation?  If so, have you already decided on a destination yet?  If you have yet to choose your family vacation destination, you may want to take a close look at the chartering of a private yacht.  Although the chartering of a private yacht isn’t like visiting the beach or an amusement park, it is something that your family may love and enjoy.

Before further examining family vacations aboard privately chartered yachts, it is first important that you know what chartering a private yacht entails.  If you weren’t already aware, the chartering of a private yacht is when you actually pay to have the yacht for a specific period of time. While this will sound a lot like renting, it isn’t exactly the same. See, when you charter a private yacht, you are not only getting the yacht, but a trained yacht staff. This staff is likely composed of a captain, as well as a number of other trained professionals.  Essentially, this means that you get to sit back and basically do nothing, aside from enjoy your family vacation.

When it comes to taking a family vacation aboard a privately chartered yacht, there are many families who wish to do so, but fear that they cannot.  One of the many reasons for that is because of restrictions.  Private yachts are often associated with luxury and romance.  For this reason, there are many individuals who believe that children are not allowed aboard privately chartered yachts.  While it is not uncommon to find a yacht chartering company that does have an age requirement or age restrictions, you will find that most companies would be more that willing to allow you to charter one of their yachts for your family vacation.  In most cases, the quick viewing of that company’s website or a quick call to their offices and you should be able to determine whether or not your children would be allowed onboard.

Although it is nice to know exactly what the chartering of a private yacht entails, you may be wondering exactly why your family should take your next family vacation aboard one. In all honesty, there are a number of different reasons.  Just of those reasons involves a change of scenery.  Where has your family spent vacations in the past?  If you are like many American families, there is a good chance that your answers would include amusement parks, campgrounds, or beaches.  While these destinations are nice, they can get old and tiring quick.  The chartering of a privately owned yacht will likely be considered new and exciting for your family, particularly your children. Although it can be considered a unique family vacation, it is one that everyone will likely enjoy.

Another reason why you may want to think about taking your next family vacation aboard a privately chartered yacht is because of quality time. In the past, family vacations were designed to allow families to spend quality time together.  Nowadays, it seems as if they have more of a focus on fun and less of a focus on quality.  Aboard a privately chartered yacht, there are an unlimited number of fun activities that you and your family can participate in, but it is also important to remember privacy. You will be on your own private yacht, without anyone else except for the crew.  For you and your family, this can mean less distractions and more one-on-one time together. 
 
The decision as to whether or not you want to charter a private yacht for your next family vacation is yours to make, but it should be something to discuss with your family.  You may be surprised with just how well the idea sounds to them.
