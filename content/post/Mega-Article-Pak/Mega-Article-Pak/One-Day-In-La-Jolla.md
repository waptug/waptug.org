One Day In La Jolla

You could easily spend a week in La Jolla, walking
on the beach, puttering around town and enjoying
meals in great restaurants; but if you only have 
one day, you can still enjoy some of the best La
Jolla has to offer.

You'll want to start off by going to the beach.  La
Jolla Shores is one of the best beaches in the 
state of California, with a gently sloping beach
and panoramic views.  A sunset or morning walk
on the beach is enough to relax even the most
stressed individual. The walk is better with the
tide going out, as it leaves the beach with a 
mirror like water display.

La Jolla is home to some of the best restaurants,
with many of them serving excellent cuisine at
lunch, although a lower price at night.  This way,
you can live large on just the right budget.

Something else you'll want to do is go tide pooling.
The Tiny La Jolla Cove is a couple of blocks away
from downtown, and accessible by a stairway.  At
low tides, the tide pools will have hundreds and
hundreds of hermit crabs.

Walking around is also a great way to spend part
of your day.  You can go for a window shopping
stroll along Prospect Avenue and the side streets
there.  With chain stores in sight, you'll 
probably find something you must have.  

If you have time to stay through the evening,
the La Jolla Playhouse is worth your time, as it
offers plenty of entertainment for the entire
family.

For just a day to spend in La Jolla, there is a
lot that you can do.  Once you spend a day in
La Jolla, you'll probably find yourself wanting
to come back for more - the town is simply that
good.
