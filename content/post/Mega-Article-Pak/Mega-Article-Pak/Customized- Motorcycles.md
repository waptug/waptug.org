Customized Motorcycles

Motorcycles are very popular, with thousands of them on the road. You will find them in a variety of makes and models for your enjoyment. Finding exactly the style you want that fits your body can prove to be difficult, especially if you are extremely short or very tall. Having a customized motorcycle made to your specifications is a great alternative, but it is also more expensive. 

One of the most well known custom motorcycle makers is Jesse James, owner of West Coast Choppers. Jesse James has been passionate about motorcycles since he was seven years old. He has customized motorcycles for many celebrities including Shaquille O’Neal, Kid Rock, and Kyle Petty. The bikes range in price from $50,000 to $150,000. 

While this is going to be much to expensive for the average individual, you can still get a great customized motorcycle from some other sources. There are many things you need to consider to get started. First, what is it that you need from a motorcycle that you can’t get from a standard one at any retailer? If it is simply the color, you will save a great deal of money by purchasing it from the retailer and having it repainted. In some cases, you may be able to contact the manufacturer and have the bike painted your ideal color at the factory.

Most of the time, individuals need to have a motorcycle customized to fit them properly. Take Shaquille O’Neal for example. He is such a large person, that the average motorcycle just doesn’t work well for him. Jesse James was able to use O’Neal’s measurements to create a motorcycle that was comfortable for him to ride. Customized motorcycles are a great choice for those with a disability that prevents them from being able to operate a standard motorcycle. 

If you are determined to have a customized motorcycle, take the time to research the various manufacturers you have to choose from. Keep in mind that you may have to wait several months or even years to get the motorcycle you want if the manufacturer is very busy. Always discuss the options you want in great detail as well as the price. If the manufacturer won’t agree to your specifications then look for someone who will. 

It is a good idea to conduct research about the manufacturer. Find out how long they have been customizing motorcycles. Ask for references and to see samples of their work. You will also want to inquire about warranty information and a guarantee if you aren’t pleased with the work. In most cases, you will have to pay a deposit before work begins on your customized motorcycle. Make sure they are familiar with working with the model of motorcycle you want to have customized. 

Having your very own motorcycle is a great recreational item to spend your time with. However, investing in a customized motorcycle will allow you to have the very best motorcycle that fits your style as well as your body. Being comfortable on your motorcycle will allow you more enjoyment and you can also use it for long road trips. You are less likely to be involved in a motorcycle accident if the motorcycle is a proper fit. While a customized motorcycle is more expensive than a traditional model, it is an investment that is well worth it.
