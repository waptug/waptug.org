Seattle's Maritime History Plays Important Role in its Current Culture

Seattle Washington is nearly surrounded by water. It is no wonder that water has played a vital role in the history of this great city. Water has also been a serious draws for those choosing to visit Seattle Washington as well. Not only is water of historical significance to this city, it is a cultural phenomenon as well. The maritime traditions of this great city are an important part of its current greatness.

If you are planning a visit to Seattle, one of the very first things you should do is head on over to the Pioneer Square Historic District and take the Underground Tour. This tour will explain to you a significant point in history about the relationship of this city and water. Take a tour of an entire section of the city that was literally buried in order to avoid plumbing problems. Find out where the term Skid Road originated and laugh along as you hear great stories about the colorful history of this part of town. 

Many Islands and Island communities abound on the outskirts of Seattle. The Ferries here are integral to the daily lives of commuters and tourists alike. Access to many tourist attractions is easily accessible by Ferry when driving would be impossible. There are often summer concerts at the Ferry Terminal on Pier 52. The last Friday of every month from June through August, they celebrate Picnic at the Pier with live music on the upper level of the Terminal from 3:00 until 6:30 p.m. There are 10 ferry accessible communities in the Puget Sound; each of these communities has a unique flavor that is really interesting to experience. If you can't visit them all, read about them and visit the ones that interest you most. It is a great day trip and you never know what creatures you will see along the way. 

If you love the water, and by this I mean you are like me and feel that a piece of your soul was meant to be at sea, then you simply can't pass up the opportunity to visit the Center for Wooden Boats. The visit is free and you get to actually see how these beautiful boats are crafted. There is nothing like literally riding the wind in a wooden sailboat and you can do just that on Sunday afternoons for free or you can charter one of their many boats during the right weather conditions. Remember these boats are works of art and should be handled with extreme care. If you're going to be in town a while you can even take one of their sailing lessons. They offer group lessons (which are excellent for beginners) and one on one training (better for this with basic knowledge of sailing).

Whether you were born with webbed feet or just enjoy the idea of being on water, there is plenty to be seen and done from the water in and around Seattle. From whale watching and sailing, to kayaking, water skiing, and any number of other water activities there is a place to partake in them all in this great area. Not all areas are suitable for all activities so be aware of the water you are near and find out what is and isn't safe to do in that area. There are some areas where the water simply isn't safe to be in for health reasons and others where the currents are dangerous and swift. Most importantly have fun exploring the great salt and fresh water in this area and learning their role in the history here.
