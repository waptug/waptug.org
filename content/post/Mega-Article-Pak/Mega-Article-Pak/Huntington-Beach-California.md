Huntington Beach California

One of the very best getaways for a beach vacation 
in California is sunny Huntington Beach.  With many
diverse sports such as surfing, biking, boating,
skateboarding, fishing, golf, tennis, and beach
volleyball - everyone can get into the game and find
something to enjoy.  Even after the sun goes down,
you'll find something to do on Huntington Beach.

Even the briefest of family beach vacations to 
Huntington Beach should include a visit to the 
International Surfing Museum, where some of the
most treasured surfing artifacts are stored.   

Other attractions ideal for Huntington Beach include
the Huntington Beach art center, and the surfers
hall of fame.  There are plenty of other things to
do here besides the beach, which is perfect for
families who want more to do than swim.

Kids of all ages will enjoy a trip to Huntington
Central Park, which is one of the largest city parks
in Southern California.  With picnic tables, 
barbeques, restaurants, sports complex, the 
Adventure Playground, and even a golf course, this
is a great place to spend some time away from 
the beach.

Huntington Beach is also within short traveling
distance to many of Southern California's most
popular attractions and sights.  Disneyland, 
Knott's Berry Farm, Wild Rivers Waterpark, and
the Aquarium of the Pacific are all less than 20
miles away from Huntington Beach.  After a fun
day of exploring and riding rides, the beach is 
an ideal place to return to.

With a lot to offer you and a lot of things to do
nearby, Huntington Beach is one of the best areas
Southern California has to offer.  There is always
something to do for your entire family, even if
your family is hard to please.  Huntington Beach
is that good - and your family will soon see that!
