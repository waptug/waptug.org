Benefits Of 1 Day Acuvue Contacts

If you wear contact lenses, you may want to look into the 1 day lenses from Acuvue.  These contact lenses put a stop to using messy solution, as they don’t need to be cleaned at all.  You simply wear your contacts during the day, then toss them away at night.  The 1 day lenses from Acuvue totally eliminate the hassle commonly associated with leaving your contacts in solution during the night, then cleaning them once you wake up.

With other types of contact lenses, you must clean them before you can wear them.  The reason for this, is the protein buildup that builds on the surface of the lens.  Once you have worn a pair of contacts for a period of time, the protein in your eyes builds up on the lens, which you eventually have to change out.  Protein is a bad thing, which is the reason why you must clean your contacts frequently and soak them in solution for hours at a time.

After you have worn them during the day, simply throw them away at night - and wake up in the morning to a brand new pair.  For your eyes, Acuvue 1 day contact lenses are the best that you can buy.  They don’t have any protein buildup, which eliminates the need for cleaning along with any damage to your eyes.

Another great thing about 1 day contact lenses is that they are flexible and great for special occasions or occasional use.  There is no need to worry about anything with these lenses, for the simple fact that you’ll get a pair for each new day.  Unlike the traditional contact lenses, 1 day contacts are an ideal way to protect your eyes and still get the vision you need to carry out your day to day activities.

Acuvue 1 day lenses are also the only contacts in the world that offer you daily usage with complete UV protection.  Even though other contacts are great to wear and may feel comfortable, they don’t quite match up to everything that Acuvue offers you.  For most contact lens users, Acuvue 1 day are the best that money can buy.  They aren’t that expensive either - especially if you buy them in bulk.

If you are just starting to wear contact lenses, using Acuvue 1 day lenses will be the smartest move you have ever hade.  These lenses offer you everything people know and love from the Acuvue brand, along with an experience you will love.  If you are ready to take things to the next level and get a pair of contacts that you don’t need to clean - 1 day lenses are the perfect pair to start your life of contacts out with.
