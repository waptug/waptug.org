Summer Vacation Destinations for Beach Lovers

Do you consider yourself a beach lover?  If you love the sand, the water, and the sun, you may be considered a beach lover, on a number of different levels.  Individual who love the beach are more likely to select a beach for their next summer vacation destination.  If you are interested in experiencing a vacation on the beach, there are a number of important factors that you should first consider.

When planning a beach vacation, there are many individuals who wish to visit the “hottest,” beaches.  While it is nice to experience what so many individuals view as popular, there are a number of disadvantages to visiting these popular vacation destinations.  One of those disadvantages includes the number of tourists. 

In the summer months, a large number of individuals flock to the beaches along the coast.  This often results in beach overcrowding.  If you do not mind be one of thousands of people at the beach, there shouldn’t be a problem.  However, if you are looking for a private or romantic beach getaway, you may want to examine more secluded beach resorts.  In addition to romantic getaways, many families find it difficult to vacation at an overcrowded beach, especially if they have young children. 

If you are looking for a secluded beach, there are a number of options. The majority of these options include inland beaches.  Many individuals do not consider inland beaches to be true beaches, but many offer the same on and offshore activities.  Inland beaches vary from location to location.  Despite their variation, all will have a body of water nearby.  Many popular inland beaches are set on the banks of a river, lake, or other large body of water.  

When choosing your summer beach destination, you will want to examine the accommodations nearby.  Large beaches are often stocked with nearby hotels. While having a number of hotels nearby is nice, you will often have to arrange travel accommodations just to reach the beach. These extra accommodations can be eliminated if you select a hotel that is within walking distance to the nearest beach.  Beach resorts are another way to select a vacation destination that does not require excessive amounts of travel.

Beach resorts are often classified as beaches that have onsite hotels.  In addition to offering overnight accommodations, beach resorts have a number of other services and features.  Onsite accommodations often include room service, in-room internet hookup, fitness centers, and onsite restaurants.  In addition to offering a large number of hotel services, many beach resorts offer vacationing services to their customers.  These services may include guided fishing tours, swimming lessons, and much more. 

If you are interested in vacationing at a beach along the coast, you have a number of options.  Almost all states, including those located up north, have ideal summer vacation spots.  Popular coastal beaches include, but are not limited to, Long Island, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Virginia, California, Texas, Oregon, and Washington.  

As previously mentioned, coastal beaches are popular vacation destinations.  If you are looking for a secluded vacation destination, that is still considered a beach, you are encouraged to examine inland beaches.  Many popular inland beaches can be found in Upstate New York, Central Florida, Wisconsin, and Michigan.

As with most other summer vacation destinations, you are encouraged to make the appropriate travel plans and overnight accommodations ahead of time.  A large number of beach hotels and beach resorts allow online reservations.
