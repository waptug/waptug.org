Creating a Guest List for a New Years Eve Party

When planning a New Years Eve party, one of the most important items of business is creating the guest list. This is important because the number of guests you plan to have at your party will influence a number of the decisions at the party. Some of these decisions may include the location of the party as well as the food which will be offered. However, this is not the only reason why it is important to create a guest list early. It is also important to do this so you can make plans for potential conflicts which are an unfortunately occurrence in any circle of friends. This article will discuss the mediation a party host often has to perform and will also discuss how the guest list has an impact on other elements of the party.

One unfortunate aspect of planning a New Years Eve party is that the host may sometimes have to make difficult decisions when she is creating her guest list. These decisions arise if there are guests at the party who do not get along. The host may be friends with all of the people they wish to invite but they may also be aware that some of their guests may not get along. This can put the host in a difficult position when creating the guest list. If the party is going to be a rather small event, the host may have to decide to eliminate certain people from the guest list if they believe they will cause an incident or make the party uncomfortable for other guests. If the event will be rather large it is less of a concern because it is possible these people may not even see each other at the party and if they do, they will certainly not be pressured to interact because there will be so many other guests. However, the host will have to use her discretion when creating the guest list and if she believes the guests will not be able to behave maturely at the party she may choose to eliminate one or more of the guests who is likely to cause a problem.

The guest list will greatly affect the location of the party. For example if you plan to host a small party for only a handful of guests you will likely have no problems hosting the party in your home. However, if you plan to invite hundreds of guest, it can be impossible to host the party in your home, unless you own an extremely large home. You will most likely have to rent a restaurant or catering hall to host your party in a location which will be large enough to accommodate all of your guests. The size of your guest list will also impact the location you select because many locations may set a minimum on the amount of guests required to reserve the room. This means you will have to pay for a certain number of guests even if you do not plan to have this many guests in attendance.

The size of your guest list will also impact the food you plan to serve at your New Years Eve party. Planning an elaborate sit down dinner for a few guests is relatively simple but this becomes more difficult for a larger group. If you invite many guests you may prefer to offer a buffet or only serve appetizers and desserts at your New Years Eve party.
