Dry Foam Carpet Cleaning

The dry foam procedure is mostly rather than dry as 
the name infers, although the content of moisture
is so low that it can actually be referred to as dry
foam (90% air - 10% liquid).  The dry foam machine
is equipped with a pressure tank, which you will
pour a solution of water and shampoo into.

A compressor will work to convert the solution into
foam which is then dispensed all over the carpet
using a revolving cylindrical brush.  The brush will
work to comb the foam through the piles of the 
carpet so that each individual fiber of the carpet
is cleaned.  

To achieve success, you must make sure that the
bubbles being produced are of uniformed size so the
foam can complete the cleaning process before it
is dispersed.  Once it has dried, the carpet is
then thoroughly vacuumed to remove the dried crystals
of dirt that have been left behind.  

Below, are the steps to the dry foam procedure:
	1.  First of all, vacuum the carpet and 
remove all the stains that you possibly can.
	2.  Mix the dry foam solution according to
the directions of the manufacturer.
	3.  Shampoo the carpet then once it has dried,
vacuum the carpet.
	4.  Depending on the type of carpet you
have, groom the pile to speed the drying process.
	5.  Complete the work by using a furniture
leg pad or block to eliminate furniture stains
or rust.

Advantages
The process of dry foam cleaning is capable of
covering a lot of area in a very short amount of
time.  There isn't really any danger involved in
saturating the carpet simply because the moisture
content is low.  This will also help you to 
minimize the problems that are commonly associated
with over wetting.

Disadvantages
The dry foam method is capable of removing average
levels of soil.  There is however a possibility of
excessive residue and soil build up if the machine
you are using has inadequate extraction capabilities.

Dry foam is the ideal method of choice if you have
older carpet if you want to get your carpet as clean
as possible.  You can rent a machine at your local
department or carpet store if you don't think you'll
use it enough to buy it.  They don't cost that 
much to rent, which is great for those who just
want to give it a shot and see what happens.

Dry foam carpet cleaning isn't that hard to do,
as you'll be fine even if you have no experience
with these types of machines.  The above information
will help you greatly, and if you follow it, you
shouldn't have any problems.  Dry foam can make a
carpet look spectacular, as long as you follow
the manufacturers directions on mixing the dry
foam solution.  Once you've finished cleaning your
carpet with dry foam, you'll probably find yourself
falling in love with the results.
