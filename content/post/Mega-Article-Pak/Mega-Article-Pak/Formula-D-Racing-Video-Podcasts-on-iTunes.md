Formula D Racing Video Podcasts on iTunes

Are you a fan of Formula D Racing?  If you are, there is a good chance that you will enjoy watching the sport, just about any chance that you get.  Unfortunately, like many other sports, Formula D Racing, also commonly referred to as Formula Drifting, only takes place at certain times and on certain courses. For that reason, you may find it difficult to get your drifting fix. If this is the case, you do not have to worry; you will find that you have a number of different ways to watch Formula D Racing or other drifting programs.

When you think of drifting programs or Formula D events, that are not live, what is the first thing that comes to your mind?  If you are like many other Americans, you would respond with television.  Recently, the Formula D Series partnered with G4TechTv, also commonly referred to as G4TV.  This popular television channel is most commonly known as a gaming channel. One of the reasons why Formula D is shown on this television station is due to the fact that Formula D or Formula Drifting is sponsored by the game Need for Speed. This is the connecting link between drifting and this popular television gaming network.

As nice as it would be to watch programs on Formula D, not everyone is able to. This is because the G4 channel is often perceived as a specialty channel.  It is not available with all cable or satellite programming packages. In fact, to gain access to this channel, many cable and satellite providers need to purchase one of the highest costing programming packages.  Unfortunately, this is something that not everyone can afford.  However, if you do have access to a computer and the internet, you can still enjoy Formula D Racing programs.  You can do this by using iTunes.

If you have the internet, watch television, or listen to the radio, there is a good chance that you have heard of iTunes before.  iTunes is a program that is created by Apple.  It allows you to legally download short movies, podcasts, music videos, as well as music.  One of the podcasts that you can find on iTunes is centered on Formula Drifting. These podcasts are presented by G4.  What is nice about these podcasts, unlike many of the other items that can be found on iTunes, is that they are free.  Essentially, this means that you can easily view these podcasts, without having to pay a thing.

Once you have iTunes installed on your computer, you should be able to use the search feature to find Formula Drifting podcasts. You may want to search with the words Formula D, Formula Drifting, or Drifting.  Once the results are displayed, you should be able to find a number of results.  G4 is planning on adding additional podcasts, but currently you can find twelve podcasts that are available for viewing.  These podcasts not only include clips from recent drifting events, but they also have other focuses.  You can find information on the cars cooling systems, as well as information on the drivers. The length of each podcast varies, but most are around two minutes long.

If you don’t already have iTunes installed on your computer, you will need to install the program.  You can easily obtain the download file for this program by visiting www.itunes.com.  Like the Formula Drifting podcasts, you will also find that it is free to download and install iTunes on your computer. The only time that you will be charged is if you make the decision to purchase other entertainment items, such as a music album.  Other than purchasing other items, which are clearly labeled for sale, it is completely free to view Formula D podcasts, which, as previously mentioned, are presented by G4TV.

Although these Formula Drifting podcasts are fairly short in size, you will still find them useful, fun, and exciting.  Whether you are looking to learn more about the sport or you just want to pass the time, you are advised to examine iTunes and the Formula D podcasts that are available.
