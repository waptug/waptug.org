Ricky Carmichael: A Championship Supercross Racer

If you are a fan of motorcycle racing, there is a good chance that you have heard the name Ricky Carmichael before. In fact, even if you aren’t a fan of racing, there is still a good chance that you have heard of Ricky Carmichael before.  Ricky Carmichael is known as one of the most popular and well known motocross and supercross racers of all time.  

Ricky Carmichael, like many other professional supercross motorcycle racers, got his start in motocross racing.  Motocross racing is similar to supercross racing; however, the races tend to occur outdoors. Outdoor tracks mean longer tracks and longer races.  Although Ricky Carmichael is most well known for his motocross racing abilities, he is also a fantastic supercross racer. In fact, he not only has numerous motocross championships, but numerous supercross championships as well.

Supercross motorcycle racing, just like motocross racing, is considered to be a dangerous sport. The racing takes place on man-made tracks. These man-made tracks are filled with exciting obstacles, including small hills and large jumps.  Although the track makes the sport exciting, it can also make it dangerous for the riders.  Overtime, Ricky Carmichael experienced a number of injuries, due to his supercross motorcycle racing.  In fact, Ricky Carmichael decided to take most of the 2004 race season off.  He did this because he had experienced a knee injury in 2003, but he later returned in 2005.

When Carmichael did return in 2005, he saw victory. When he returned, he ended up returning with a new team, Suzuki.  2006 is Ricky Carmichael’s second season with the Suzuki team.  Prior to racing with Suzuki and on a Suzuki motorcycle, Ricky Carmichael was a member of the Kawasaki team and then the Honda team.  In fact, his previous decision to move from Kawasaki to Honda, before finally becoming a member of the Suzuki team, was a highly publicized move. Not everyone agreed with the move, including his fans, but it did turn out well in the end.  

As previously mentioned, Ricky Carmichael saw victory when he partnered with Suzuki motorcycles.  That partnership has even led the development of the replica Ricky Carmichael motocross, supercross motorcycle.  The motorcycle is a RM-Z450. What is unique about it is that type of motorcycle is that it is a four stroke motorcycle.  This same exact motorcycle type, the one that is being sold as a replica by Suzuki, was the first four stroke motorcycle to ever win an AMA Supercross Championship.

Although Ricky Carmichael is not the only “big name,” in supercross, is one of the best.  Additional supercross motorcycle stars include, but are not limited to, Chad Reed and Jeremy McGrath.  Ricky Carmichael has been able to hold his own against these competitors. In fact, it was Ricky Carmichael who took over the supercross championship from Jeremy McGrath. That occurred in 2001.  Chad Reed was the champion in 2004, the year that Ricky Carmichael decided to take a year off from supercross motorcycle racing.  However, as previously mentioned, once he returned he saw victory.
