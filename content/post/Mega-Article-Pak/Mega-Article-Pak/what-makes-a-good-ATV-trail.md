What Makes a Good ATV Trail?
 
There are thousands of ATV trails throughout North America (and more are being charted every day), but how do you judge whether you’ve found a good one or not?  Here, we’ll examine a few of the elements that you need to look for when deciding where to take your four-wheeled “baby” for your next pleasure cruise.

Generally, if you’re someone who is familiar with four-wheeling, you’ll want an ATV trail that has some length to it.  Otherwise, you could risk becoming bored when you just go in circles in the same field.  ATV trails can be a few to a hundred miles long; start small and gradually build up your endurance.  If you’re a beginner, ask a more experienced ATV operator to show you the ropes; heading out on your own is a dicey proposition and not recommended.

You want an ATV trail that matches your ability, or it won’t be much fun.  Thus, if you’re a novice, don’t start your four-wheeling hobby in an extremely mountainous region or one that requires a great deal of ATV riding know-how.  Similarly, if you’re someone who has a great deal of ATV operation experience, you should find a suitable trail or you’ll be overcome by ennui an hour into your excursion.

One of the greatest aspects of ATV riding is enjoying the natural surroundings, so be certain that your next trail ride is one that includes some amazing views or which allows you to soak in the beauty of the area.  Remember you don’t have to be a photographer, an artist or a poet to be moved by a snaking stream or a radiant sunrise.  

Not sure if a trail or area is open to ATV travelers?  Then stop before gunning your motor and don’t ride on any trail or in any region until you have been given the “okay” by either the property owner or a legal authority.  Far too many four-wheeling enthusiasts have given the sport a bad name by ripping through private property or tearing up national parks.  There are plenty of legal ATV trails out there; make sure the one you choose is on the up-and-up or you could be hammered with a heavy fine.

The last thing you want is to get lost during an ATV trail ride.  Riding without the proper gear while outside in the elements can be uncomfortable, scary, and deadly in some situations.  Therefore, if you’re unfamiliar with your ATV trail, make sure you obtain a map of the region so you can stay aware of your bearings.  Even if you never need to glance at the map, it’s still better to have it than to end up wondering, “Where the heck am I?” while a dark night approaches.

Finally, one of the most important elements of a great ATV trail is that it is one you want to share with friends and other riders.  You will know you’ve found an awesome path when you can’t wait to get on your blog and start bragging about your recent excursion to other four-wheeling adventurers.  After all, when you’ve found something that’s really exciting, it’s up to you to share the news with your friends all over the world.
