Intro To CD Mastering

Even though many assume that the mixing of the
seperate audio tracks is the final step, a recording
should always be mastered well in order to sound
great.  CD mastering is the final chance for
creative input when you create a compact disc.
After the discs has been mastered, it can be printed,
reproduced, and then sold.

The process of mastering a CD actually involves
several steps.  The first step is putting the songs,
or tracks at this point in the correct order.  The
length of time between the songs is also adjusted,
along with the editing of the songs.  Any unlisted
or secret songs on the CD are normally added at
this point as well.

There are several ways that you can go about 
mastering a CD.  First of all, the mix can be 
sent to a professional CD mastering engineer, 
which is what professional musicians normally 
decide to do.

The mastering engineers will often work in their
own mastering facilities, which are very different
from standard studios, in the fact that they have 
much less gear and are designed for the best
possible playback of the mix as possible in
order to fix anything that's wrong.  

Aside from mastering engineers, CDs can also be
mastered at home using computer software.  This 
option is normally more realistic for unsigned
artists or musicians who are just starting out
with their music.  Depending on the software
quality and skill of the individual doing the
mastering, the CD may turn out perfect or it 
may sound very unprofessional.

You can also refer to online CD mastering as 
another option.  Cds that are mastered online
can be great, as instead of sending a mix to a
mastering engineer, the mix is instead sent
via the Internet.  To do this, you'll need a 
high speed Internet connection.

The cheapest way to go about mastering a CD is
with free mastering.  Artists and musicians may
choose to use free mastering programs with 
demos or other earlier recordings that artists
will use to send to major record labels to 
generate some interest in their music.

The major differences with a professional CD
and an amateur recording is normally found in
the mastering.  Every song that you hear played
on the radio is thoroughly mastered in order
to sound better.

While you can master using free programs or 
your computer, a professional CD mastering 
engineer is normally the best way to do business
if your band is looking to make a profit from
your music.
