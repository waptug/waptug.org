Understanding Women on Valentine’s Day

One complaint that many men have is that they just don’t understand what women expect from them on Valentine’s Day. This can make planning for Valentine’s Day a very stressful experience for men. They are worried that the gift they buy will say the wrong thing or that their gift will be misinterpreted by their girlfriend or wife. As a result they often wind up either doing too much or too little on Valentine’s Day and have trouble finding that happy balance where their gift will be appreciated without their partners reading too much into the gift. The key to finding this perfect gift is to understand women and how they think of Valentine’s Day.

The most important rule for men to remember is that when women say it is okay for you to not do anything for Valentine’s Day, 99.99% of the time they do not mean this. It is true there are some women who really do not expect anything from their boyfriends or husbands on Valentine’s Day but the vast majority will be extremely disappointed if you allow Valentine’s Day to pass without even a card or a small gift. So unless you are absolutely sure your partner is one of those women who really does not care about Valentine’s Day it is a safe bet to at least get a card and a flower for the special woman in your life. She is likely to be disappointed if you don’t. 

Now you might be wondering what type of card you should get for the special woman in your life on Valentine’s Day. There are humorous cards available for purchase on Valentine’s Day but again unless you are absolutely sure this is the type of card your partner will like it is a better idea to go with a romantic card. You can find these types of cards expressing a number of different sentiments and are likely to find a card which expresses your feelings about the relationship perfectly. Men may not realize this but women typically put a great deal of time and effort into selecting your card and they may be disappointed if you do not do the same when selecting a card for them. 

Men should also be aware that women do not want to be reminded of their diets on Valentine’s Day. Your girlfriend or wife may talk about wanting to lose weight and may be trying to exercise and eat right but this does not mean she wants you to buy her sugar free candy and give her workout equipment for Valentine’s Day. You may think you are doing something great for your girlfriend or wife but trust us on this one, she will think you are calling her fat. If you really want to support your partner in her diet efforts, you can give her a small box of chocolates and a piece of jewelry instead. Conversely, a box of diet cookies and a workout video are not likely to be well received.

Finally, one of the most important things for men to remember is it really is the thought that counts. Women want to feel special on Valentine’s Day. Extravagant gifts may seem like a good idea and may be well received but most women really just want to know that you love them on Valentine’s Day. So whether you give them expensive jewelry or make the effort to cook them dinner they will know how you feel about them.
