Tips For Selling Wine

In the world of wine, the Internet has drastically changed the business and landscape for a lot of industries and manufacturers.  Retails and wineries alike are using the Internet to sell their unique wine to the public, reaching more people than they ever could before.  For the public, the Internet provides a lot of options for buying or even selling wine.

The key to selling wine is knowing the conditions of the bottle, such as how it was stored, how old it is, and the price you are asking for the wine. Age worthy wines are normally the best selling, as they all have one thing in common - all can be held for quite a long time.  These types of wines are high in demand, some dating back to the 1940s.  They are still selling strong today, some even going for an high as $5,000 dollars a bottle!  If you have any bottles of age worthy wines, you should hang on to them for as long as you can - then sell them for a hefty profit.

Vintage Port is one of the best age worthy wines.  Being a fortified wine, Vintage Port brands can age for nearly 100 years or more.  The big names include Taylor Fladgate and Fonseca, among others.  Port wine is very popular these days, with people buying and selling it to rake in the profits.  As long as you take care of the bottles and store them properly, they can bring in a lot of money.

Fine Italian wine is also great to have, as they are normally bought and sold online.  You can store these types of wine for several years, as they still provide great taste.  Top California Cabernet is another type of wine that sells great, although it can be hard to get.  If you buy the right type of Top California wine, you can sell it for 2 - 3 times the price you paid for the bottle.

If you are looking to sell wine, online auctions are a great place to start.  By using an online auction, you can list your wine that you are selling, and get the current prices on wines that you are thinking of selling as well.  If you look around on the Internet, you can find some great auction web sites that will allow you to sell wine.  There are several out there, giving you plenty to choose from.  When you find one that you like, make sure that you look at the prices and how things work - before you decide to use it to sell your wine.

Another great place to go online are wine message boards. Most wine message boards offer a buying and selling area as well.  Almost all message boards are free to join, although you should become active with your postings to gain trust on the boards.  Members of the boards sell their wines to each other.  Selling is done privately, which eliminates any type of transaction fee.

Proper storage is also important when selling wine.  Not only for the seller, but the buyer as well.  In order to sell wine, the wine needs to be stored properly, with the proper temperature.  If it isn’t, the wine will be nothing but mere vinegar once it is opened up.  

All things aside, wine can be a very profitable hobby, providing you do things right.  If you have a passion for wine and a passion to succeed - selling wine can be very profitable.  When selling wine, you should always put quality first.  Money will come with time - although you should always think about the quality of the wine - and not just the dollars and cents.
