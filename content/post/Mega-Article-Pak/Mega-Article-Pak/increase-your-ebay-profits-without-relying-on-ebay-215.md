Increase Your eBay Profits Without Relying on 
eBay!

While it is possible to earn a full time living on eBay, 
it is a mistake to depend solely on eBay for your 
income. You could be using your eBay auctions to 
generate a huge amount of business for other 
products and services! Many people, however, 
fail to fully utilize eBay’s resources to this end.

eBay has over 100 million members, and they 
gained those members by continually running major 
marketing campaigns. Essentially, they do your 
marketing for you. But you have to help yourself as 
well. The key is to drive people to your auction page, 
which in turn can be used to drive traffic to your 
website.

You can sell many different items on your website, 
including items that are up for auction at eBay! This 
is a fabulous way to earn income that does not rely 
on eBay auctions. You can easily accept website 
payments with a Paypal account, so there is no 
need for an expensive merchant account!

You are not allowed to include the website address 
of an outside website on your auctions – you are, 
however, perfectly welcome to place a link to your 
website on your eBay ‘About Me’ page. Invite your 
bidders and potential bidders to view your about me 
page, and watch the website traffic roll in!
