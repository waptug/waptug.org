When Is The Best Time To Be At Disneyland?

When you are planning your Disneyland vacation, 
you should note that some days are better than,
others at the park. The days that you choose to be 
there will depend greatly on whether you are more 
interested in attractions or entertainment – or both.

For instance, Tuesday’s, Wednesday’s, and 
Thursday’s are the days when you will have shorter l
ines for the attractions, because there will be fewer 
people there. On the other hand, the entertainment 
on those nights cannot compare to the entertainment 
that is offered on the weekends. If entertainment is 
important, plan your visit to Disneyland for the 
weekend.

If you will be at Disneyland for several days, however, 
plan to ride the attractions on Tuesday, Wednesday 
and Thursday, and then enjoy the entertainment, as 
well as the other things the park has to offer on the 
other days. If you are visiting during the off-season, 
you should note that entertainment usually isn’t 
offered on weekdays. Also remember that the park 
really fills up as the day wears on, so try to ride the 
attractions in the morning if possible!
