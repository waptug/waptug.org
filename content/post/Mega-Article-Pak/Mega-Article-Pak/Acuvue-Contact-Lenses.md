Acuvue Contact Lenses

Its really no secret that Acuvue is one of the most popular and most dominant brands of contact lenses out there on the market.  There are several different types of Acuvue contact lenses to choose from, including Advanced, Acuvue 2 Colors, and lenses that contain the very popular and innovative Hydraclear.  Oasys is another type of Acuvue contact lens, although it is somewhat new and isn’t as easy to find.

Just like other brands and types of contacts, Acuvue lenses were designed to correct many vision problems such as far sight, astigmatism, near sight, and the inability or lack of changing focus from far to near.  Acuvue offers you options as well, such as hard lenses, soft lenses, and even toric contact lenses.  

To make things better for you, Acuvue contacts have a few different periods of wear.  Some of them, such as the Acuvue Advanced, are designed to be worn for a two week period, after which they need to be discarded and replaced with a fresh pair.  Some types of Acuvue lenses are made for daily use, which means that you must use a fresh pair each day.  Normally, Acuvue contacts are intended for daily use and need to be soaked in solution while you sleep, although there are types that can be left in while you sleep, although you’ll need to clean them on a regular basis.

Although Acuvue contact lenses are considered to be the best contacts you can buy, you should always check with your optician first, as he can tell you which contacts will work best for your eyes.  He can also tell you everything you need to know about contacts, and how to take care of them as well.  You’ll need to clean your contacts daily, unless you chose to go with the 1day Acuvue contacts, which you’ll change out every day - eliminating the need for cleaning.

Among the many types of Acuvue lenses, those that contain Hydraclear are easily the most popular.  Acuvue Advance with Hydraclear are preferred by many, as they are easily among the most comfortable.  Hydraclear is a breakthrough in contact lens innovation, helping to prevent your eyes from drying out.  

Acuvue contacts are also known for their appearance as well, as they are easily among the best in both comfort and style.  Acuvue strives to be the best in contact lenses, which is why their contacts have very little problems.  As long as you take care of them, the contacts shouldn’t give you any problems.  On the other hand, if you don’t clean them or take care of them as you should, you’ll more than likely encounter some problems.

You can find Acuvue contacts at your local optician’s office, at your local department store (if they sell contacts), or online.  Online is the best way to purchase, as you’ll normally get amazing discounts and you’ll find many types of Acuvue contacts that you won’t be able to find locally.  

All in all, Acuvue is considered to be the best brand in contact lenses.  They have been around for many years, providing those who wear contacts the best in comfort and innovation.  If you wear contacts, you are probably already familiar with Acuvue.  If you wear contacts but haven’t tried them yet, you really should.  Acuvue has many different designs to offer you, and they can easily become your preferred brand if you give them the chance.  They are very affordable as well - which makes them an ideal investment for any budget.
