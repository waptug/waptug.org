The Difference between Supercross Racing and Motocross Racing

When it comes to off-road motorcycle racing, there are a number of different variations of the sport. Two of the most popular variations include supercross motorcycle racing and motocross motorcycle racing.  To those unfamiliar with the world of off-road racing, it can be difficult to separate the two apart from each other. In fact, many, who are unfamiliar with the sport, tend to believe that they are the same thing. While motocross motorcycle racing and supercross motorcycle racing do have their similarities, they are two completely different sports.

Motocross motorcycle racing was first developed before supercross racing was ever heard of.  Motocross racing events take place in outdoor venues. Their racing tracks vary in size, but many tend to be around one or two miles long.  Due to the size of most motocross racing tracks, these events largely take place in rural or country locations.  Motocross motorcycle racing is different than most other forms of motorcycle racing due to the fact that it has off-road track features. These features most commonly include jumps, corners, and other obstacles.

Although motocross racing events take place outdoors, the natural terrain isn’t always enough to create amazing courses. For that reason, motocross racing surfaces are a combination of natural terrain and man-made obstacles.  These man-made obstacles are most commonly created by taking large amounts of dirt and molding it to create a unique, track surface.  In addition to straight up racing, motocross is also known for the skill that is needed. To maneuver around the track, often with thirty or forty other racers, skill is needed.  That skill combined with the excitement of racing is what makes motocross racing so popular and that is the reason why its popularity still exists today.

Although motocross motorcycle racing is still one of racing’s most popular sports, not everyone gets to enjoy it.  This is largely due in part the location of most motocross racing events.  As previously mentioned, most motocross events take place in the outdoors.  Many cities and towns, across America, do not have the space for an outdoor motocross track; however, that does not mean that big city or big town residents do not have a love for the sport.  It just means that it was difficult for most to watch a live event; that was until the development of supercross motorcycle racing.

Supercross motorcycle racing, although it is not the same as motocross racing, is a variation of the sport.  It was created largely in part due to the fact that not all racing fans had access to their favorite off-road racing sport.  Unlike motocross racing, supercross racing events take place in a large indoor stadium. These events commonly take place inside of indoor football stadiums and other similar sports centers. Although the racing is taking place indoors, it is still considered off-road racing, like motocross because man-made tracks are created.  

The man-made tracks are used to create racing surfaces that are similar to those found in outdoor motocross racing events. The only difference is that the courses are smaller. For that reason, supercross motorcycle racing events are usually shorter. That shorter track allows them to have a limited number of drivers.  Depending on the course and the preference of race promoters, many supercross races have only around twenty to twenty-five rides. Despite the fact that this number seems fairly small, it is important to remember that the size of indoor supercross tracks are relatively small, when compared to outdoor motocross tracks.

As you can easily see, there is a difference between supercross motorcycle racing and motocross motorcycle racing. It may not appear as if there is a difference, but once you take the time to fully research and understand each sport, you will learn that there is a difference, often more than one.  Although the same equipment is used and even the goals are the same, there is a difference between the two.  Essentially, these differences mean that exciting off-road racing can be enjoyed by all, even those who do not leave in rural country areas.
