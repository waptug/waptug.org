Auto Navigation Systems that use Laptops or PDAs

You may or may not be aware of the many options on today's market when it comes to auto navigation systems. Take my word for it there are now more options than ever before with new options appearing daily. Among the many options that are available for those of you who are interested in obtaining equipment that will assist you in finding your way on long and short trips there are options that can be used along with your laptop or PDA devices. If you currently own and use on a regular basis a laptop or PDA the software or other devices and receivers that are required in order to utilize your laptop as a GPS device aren't nearly as expensive as purchasing a stand alone auto navigation system.

In fact, as far as money savers go, this is a great way to save money on your purchase and receive the same great benefits that some of the top of the line auto navigation systems has to offer. You will find these types of devices that are geared towards as many different budgets as the actual stand alone systems. Some of the more popular of these tools include the following:

1) US Global Sat BU-353 USB port GPS Receiver. This nifty device costs less than $100 and allows you to turn your laptop or pc into a GPS. This is a great feature for finding directions and attaches to your laptop through the USB port.

2) DeLorme Earthmate LT-20 GPS. This is also a little less than $100 and gives your laptop fully functional navigation features. This not only works with laptops but also with Palm OS. You will experience rapid satellite acquisition and you have the Street Atlas software to guide you towards your destination. The software is included with the Earthmate. This software will even recalculate your directions should you miss a turn along the way. For the price, I highly recommend this if you have a PDA or laptop already.

3)  DeLorme Earthmate Blue Logger Bluetooth Wireless GPS. This is another nifty tool by DeLorme. This device will allow you to receive a real time image of your location but requires an unobstructed view of the sky in order to accurately record its current position. This device also works with Street Atlas software in order to assist you in charting your course and giving proper driving directions.

4) Tom Tom Navigator 6 Bluetooth. If you are looking for feature rich navigation then this is certainly the tool for you. This is useful with laptops and Palm systems. Not only will you find mapping technology that is quite superior but you will also find useful things such as parking garages, fueling stations, and restaurants along the way.

You will notice a great variety of prices and features with these devices. The important thing to remember is that you want the same or better features for less with this type of equipment since you are providing either the laptop or the PDA. If you already have the laptop or PDA you should be able to save a tremendous amount of money over the costs of purchasing a stand-alone auto navigation system. If you aren't getting an incredible bargain you might want to debate whether or not the system you opt for really is the best system for you.

Perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is the fact that your laptop or PDA can become an important tool in keeping you on the right track when traveling. You may be one of the lucky few who has never gotten lost while traveling (or one of those who refuses to believe they are lost) however, if you aren't then perhaps it is time to seriously invest in either software, equipment, or devices that can help you find your way whenever you are lost. Laptop and PDA equipment offer great alternatives for those who need navigational assistance but need to remain within a strict budget.
