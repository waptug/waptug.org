Vacation Rentals

Many vacationers opt to rent a home in their vacation destination rather than staying in a hotel. For these vacationers, this is a worthwhile option because it gives the vacationer a more comfortable place to stay with features such as cooking facilities which are not typically offered in commercial hotels. Finding these vacation rentals can be significantly more difficult than simply making hotel reservations but many vacationers report this to be a worthwhile effort. However, some care should be taken when renting a vacation home to ensure the quality of the home meets the expectations of the vacationers. 

Finding Vacation Rentals

Finding a vacation rental property can obviously be much more difficult than simply renting a hotel during the vacation. Of course some vacationers will be lucky and have a friend or family member who owns a home in a particular vacation destination and is willing to rent it out to others. Those who do not have this type of fortunate situation have other options for finding a vacation rental property.

Many homeowners in popular vacation destinations rent out their home during the peak season. These homeowners may allow a realtor to handle the transactions. Contacting realtors in the area of the vacation destination and inquiring about available rental properties in the area is one way to start the search. The realtor will likely be able to assist you in finding a home for rent. 

There are also many popular websites where homes for rent are listed directly by the owner of the home. Searching the Internet can lead you to a reliable source of homes for rent. These homes are usually divided into categories by region and will likely provide you instant access to available dates. It will likely give useful information such as whether or not pets are allowed, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms as well as the size of the home and the proximity to nearby attraction. The listing may also provide useful information regarding the furnishings of the home. Some rental properties may include items such as bedding and cookware while some may not. 

Ask Questions before Renting a Vacation Home

Vacationers who wish to rent a vacation home as opposed to spending their vacation in a hotel should exercise a certain amount of caution in selecting a property to rent. Being cautious will not only enable the vacationer to ensure his rental property meets his expectations but will also help to avoid potentially dangerous situations. One way to avoid these potential problems is by asking a great deal of questions during the process.

Renting a vacation home through a rental agency is ideal for safety purposes. In these situations the agency handles the entire rental giving the renter the security of knowing they are not walking into a potentially dangerous situation. However, even in this situation the renter should ask some important questions. These questions will be explained in the subsequent paragraphs.

How old is the property? Potential renters should ask questions about the age of the property and whether or not appliances, plumbing and electricity have been updated. This is important because this type of information can mean the difference between a comfortable stay in the property and dealing with problems related to the age of the home.

What is included in the rental? While most rentals include the basic necessities, there are some rental agreements which only include the use of the house and furniture. Renters may be required to bring along bedding, towels and even cookware. 

How often is the property rented and how is it maintained? These two questions are inter-related because properties which are rented often see significantly more wear and tear than properties which are only rented a couple of times per year. Properties which are rented often should employ a maid service to clean the property thoroughly between each rental and possibly during longer rental periods. 

What is the exact location of the property? Asking this question will enable the vacationer to determine whether or not the property is ideally situated for the purposes of the vacation. For example a vacationer on a ski trip would want to be situated close to the mountains while a vacationer more interested in a cultural vacation might be interested in a downtown location which will likely be closer to museums and other locations of interest.
