Buying Orange Paintings for Friends

Buying orange paintings for friends can be very rewarding.  This can also be a business if it is done properly.  If you know your friend’s tastes, you can be very successful.

I have been finding the most delightful paintings in orange lately.  I have been buying the paintings for friends.  They have been very well received.

I found a seascape that had a beautiful red and orange sunset in it.  The artist was Robyn Joy and buying paintings from her has been relatively easy.  Her prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent.

There was a painting that I decided to buy for some friends that were getting married.  The painting was enormous and perfect for the loft they just purchased.  It was orange and red and had a very stylized heart represented in the center.  The painting was shipped from Germany and arrived only three days before the wedding!

The painting that I chose for my son’s college roommate was of orange sneakers.  He got an executive position at Nike and needed help decorating his office.  He loves the color orange and was thrilled that I actually found some dynamic modern impressionistic art for his office that featured shoes.

My yoga instructor has been a good friend to me.  I found buying a painting for her to be a very rewarding search.  The painting that I ultimately chose was an abstract nude orange oil painting.  She proudly hung it in her studio.

My love of orange paintings tends to lean toward the abstract.  I keep finding paintings that really speak to me.  Buying the paintings for my friends has been really fun.  One of my oldest friends received a painting of orange blossoms for Christmas.  I know that orange trees bring back wonderful memories for her.

While I was searching for just the right painting for my friend’s new home, I found a wonderful artist named Aileen.  I bought her painting called Sunset Palm.  It was an original acrylic painting on solid wood.  It was breathtaking.

Folk art is something that I am not very good at buying.  I found myself drawn to some pieces at a local gallery that were very colorful and fun.  I even found myself buying one!  The friends that I bought the painting for are cat lovers and this was a folk art painting of three cats.

The painting I bought for my best friend looks very stylish on her plain walls.  It complements her modern furnishings and it makes an instant focal and conversational point.  This painting is orange and burnt sienna has a dream like quality and, according to the artist, is born from our rich cultural heritage of myths, legends and poetry. It is full of atmosphere and evokes feelings of mystery.

Pop art is fun to buy for friends.  I had a friend move to Southern California and buy a beautiful home.  I found the perfect painting for his stark white kitchen.  The painting is of an orange and a glass of orange juice.  It looks so nice on the new wainscoting.

My niece is getting married later this year.  I have spent quite a bit of time getting to know her soon-to-be new in-laws.  I have found a lovely painting for them as a welcome to our family gift.  They are involved in rose competitions and I found them a wonderful oil painting of a wild orange rose.  I can’t wait to give it to them.

The most energetic painting I’ve purchased was for a friend of my husband.  I found an art student at the local college that was trying to sell a wall painting she had done in orange and green.  The painting depicted orange and green in nature and how they represented the moods of the day.  I wanted to keep this one for myself.

I have a friend that teaches in a Montessori school.  I found that buying a painting for the school was pretty easy.  The classroom my friend teaches in is called the Iris room and I found a lovely watercolor painting of an iris that was very vibrant.  My friend and her students sent me a very lovely thank you note for buying it.
