The Evaluation Process Of Data Recovery

As most people already know, almost all hard drives fail due to normal use and conditions.  Although it can happen at anytime, hard drive failure normally takes several years to occur, due to normal wear and tear.  No matter what the case may be, you should always be fully aware of the options that are available to you, and what you should do if your hard drive fails.

Data recovery is the most useful and by far the best way to retrieve data that has been lost or deleted from a hard drive.  Hard drive recovery can restore files that have been lost, no matter what the cause may be.  From viruses to crashes, data recovery can restore the files on your hard drive by rebuilding the platters and the structure of the drive.  Most experienced computer technicians can restore your hard drive in just a couple of days.

Before you hard drive can be rebuilt, it must be evaluated.  The evaluation process will give the technician a chance to go through your hard drive, determine what caused the failure, and what they need to do to restore your data.  This is a very extensive process that involving a series of steps performed by the technician.

First things first, the technician must determine if the problem is logical, physical, or possibly a combination of both.  Physical failures result in hardware malfunctions, while the logical problems lie in the software.  Once the technician has found the problem and the cause, he can plan out the repair process and what he needs to do to recover the information.

If the technician is able to gain access into the hard drive, he or she will then create a mirrored image of the drive and continue the process.  The data structure will come next, where the technician will determine just how much of the data can be saved.  This step in the evaluation can be the most time consuming, as the technician or technicians will have to go through each sector step by step and located what data can be retrieved and what data cannot be retrieved.

Once the evaluation process has been completed, the results will be given to you.  The technician will normally go over everything with you, and explain the options you have available.  This is where they will discuss pricing, as well as how long it will take.  They will also let you know how much data can be retrieved, and what they think caused the problem.  You can always get a second opinion if you choose, or go ahead and use the technician.  In the rare event that no data can be retrieved, the technician will tell you that nothing can be done for your hard drive.  Keep in mind that before they do anything to retrieve data, they will always contact you first to find out what you want to do.

Normally, most data can be retrieved in as little as 48 hours.  The evaluation process may take a few days, as it is more time consuming and planned out than the actual data recovery process.  The evaluation process can take longer depending on the parts that are needed, or if other technicians need to be involved with the process.  If the technician has all of the necessary parts on hand and the experience, it normally doesn’t take long.  On the other hand, if the hard drive has a lot of hardware and mechanical problems - it can take a few weeks before you find out anything.
