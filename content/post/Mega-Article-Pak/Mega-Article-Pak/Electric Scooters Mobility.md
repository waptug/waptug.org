Electric Mobility Scooters And What To Look For

Electric mobility scooters are designed to assist those who have physical conditions that make walking difficult enjoy the sense of independence and freedom that comes from mobility. When selecting the appropriate make and model of an electric scooter the individual rider’s overall physical condition and personal preferences need to be considered in relation to the basic construction of the scooter.

The basic construction should combine a backrest, seat and foot support to provide a comfortable and stable seating base.  This enables riders to expend their energy on the essential activities, such as operating the vehicle and accomplishing tasks from within the mobility scooter rather than wasting effort trying to maintain a comfortable, upright position. The seat unit should have an anatomically contoured seat base and backrest and be wide enough to accommodate outdoor clothing if necessary. However, it should not be so wide that the user is forced to sit asymmetrically to feel properly supported.  If the seat is too narrow it will become uncomfortable and increase the risk of pressure sores.

Try to choose an electric mobility scooter that has a seat and backrest which can be adjusted to meet individual comfort levels. Additionally, a seat with fold up armrests adds to the comfort of the rider, make transferring on and off the seat easier and will reduce the amount of physical strain on the upper body. A stable seating posture is essential in order to manage the vehicle’s controls which are located on the tiller, or steering column and handlebars. 

The tiller is the control and steering mechanism for the mobility scooter and has the controls to drive the scooter forward or in reverse, as well as steering the front wheels. Some tillers feature height and angle adjustability to ensure that the rider can comfortably reach the tiller and therefore has maximum control over the scooter. A console, centrally located on the tiller, has the supplementary controls for lights, indicators, horn and to power the unit on and off. Two hands are typically required to manage the tiller steering component of an electric mobility scooter. Some models can be controlled by only one hand if the model is equipped with one level for acceleration that switches for forward and reverse mode, however operating supplementary controls at the same time as steering can be difficult. 

If the intended rider is interested in an electric mobility scooter that will travel as well as provide travel you will want to investigate transportable electric mobility scooters. Transportable mobility scooters can be dismantled for transport and storage. On larger scooters or those intended for rugged outdoor use, you may want to check the weight of the largest individual piece in order to be properly prepared to disassemble as individual components can still be quite heavy. Although a convenient feature, when you consider transporting a mobility scooter you will have to keep in mind that transporting the scooter will require it to be broken down before the next destination, assembled upon arrival, disassembled upon return and once again assembled for use at home. This may not seem very convenient, but when it comes to being able to join family and friends on a special outing or having to choose to not participate due to physical limitations, the break down and set up of the mobility scooter is a more than worthwhile small chore in comparison to the benefits it brings to the rider and their ability to interact independently with family and friends.
