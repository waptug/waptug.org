Stay at Home Moms:  Make Money Selling Software Programs

There are millions of mothers who consider becoming stay at home moms.  Unfortunately, many of those mothers do not take action. There are a number of different reasons for that, but the most important one is money.  For some families, it is just impossible to survive on only one income; however, you do not have to. If you are interested in becoming a stay at home mom, you can do so while generating income at the same time. This can be done by acquiring the resell rights to a software program.

At any given time, there are a number of software developers and designers who are working on creating a new product. Once that product has been created, the selling process should begin.  The problem that many software developers and designers face is that they do not know how to go about selling their products. Instead of taking the time to learn how, they rely on someone else to do the selling for them.  If you think that this sounds like a commission based program, you are wrong.

Instead of purchasing the whole product, you are purchasing the right to resell it.  After that transaction has occurred, you can do just about whatever you want to the software program. This not only includes selling it, but altering it to become something more.  In fact, many stay at home moms, who participate in this type of opportunity, decide to alter the software in some way. Doing so often allows them to claim the program as their own.
