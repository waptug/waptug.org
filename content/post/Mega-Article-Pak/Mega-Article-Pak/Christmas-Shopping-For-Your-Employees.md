Christmas Shopping For Your Employees

If you are the boss at your company and you and your company have had a successful year financially, you may want to share some of that success by purchasing Christmas gifts for your employees. However, Christmas shopping for your employees is not an easy task. There are a number of factors which contribute to the difficulty of the situation. The number of employees is one such factor. You may have a large number of employees and they may not share similar interests making it difficult to decide on a gift. Additionally, you may be concerned with the prospect of employees talking about their gifts and jealousy arising if it is believed some employees received more expensive or better gifts than others. This article will discuss some of these concerns and will offer tips for dealing with these dilemmas. 

Favoritism is a serious issue which all bosses should carefully consider when Christmas shopping for their employees. Bosses should assume the gifts they give to their employees will be discussed and compared so it is wise to not purchase any gifts which will be viewed as favoritism. One way to avoid this problem is to purchase the same item for each of the employees. This may seem impersonal but office politics often takes precedence over sentiment and in this case it is wise to give each employee the same item to avoid any potential problems. The boss may opt to give more expensive items to hiring ranking employees. This is an acceptable practice as long as each employee on the same tier is given the same gift and employees on higher tiers are given more expensive gifts than employees on lower tiers. 

Bosses also have to consider finances when Christmas shopping for gifts for their employees. This is a particularly important concern especially in cases where the boss has a large number of employees working for him. In this case the boss may have to consider giving only small token gifts due to the large number of employees. If he is paying for these gifts out of his own pocket, it is not reasonable to expect him to purchase extravagant gifts for many employees. If the boss is receiving a bonus for his hard work during the year, he may make a decision to allot a percentage of his bonus to the purpose of purchasing Christmas gifts for his employees as a way to show his appreciation for their hard work and dedication throughout the year. In some cases, the company may even allow their high ranking employees to expense the purchase of Christmas gifts for employees because it is viewed as a method of keeping morale high and retaining employees. In this case the boss should review the company policy and determine how much it is acceptable to spend on each employee before doing his Christmas shopping to ensure he will not be violating any company policies in making his purchases.

Another difficulty bosses often face when Christmas shopping for their employees is selecting a gift which will be appropriate for all of the employees. This can be a difficult task because the boss may have a wide range of employees working for him with varying interests. As previously discussed, it is considered a good idea to purchase the same gift for each employee instead of choosing a distinct gift for everyone. While this makes shopping easier in one capacity by ensuring the boss only has to select one gift, it complicates the Christmas shopping process by tasking the boss to select one gift which will be universally appreciated by all of the employees in the office. Examples of some gifts which are generally appreciated by all may include items with the company logo such as sweatshirts, mugs or other office items. These gifts are not only practical but also help to promote a sense of pride in the company. Gift certificates are also always appreciated. Gift certificates to local restaurants or business or online retailers are gifts which are likely to be appreciated and valued by all.
