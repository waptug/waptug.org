Universal Studios Tours – Movies and Fun

Universal Studios began offering tours in 1964. 
Today, Universal Studios still offers tours, and they 
still make movies – but it has also become one of 
the largest amusement parks in the world. In fact, 
Universal Studios has mixed movie making with 
shows and a theme park full of rides to become 
one of the most popular tourist attractions in the 
world.

The Studio tour is a one hour guided tour. Those on 
the tour ride around the studio’s 420 acres on a 
tram, and see many stars dressing rooms, 
production offices, and often famous Hollywood 
stars. Where else can you see a western town and 
a New York City street all in the same hour? The 
tour includes sets from Back to the Future, Curse 
of the Mummy’s Tomb, Jurassic Park III, and The 
Grinch. This is more than just your boring tour 
with a boring monotone tour guide! As the tour 
progresses, tourists encounter many disasters! 

Once you’ve finished your tour of the studios, you 
can move on to the theme park. All of the rides have 
a movie oriented theme, such as Revenge of the 
Mummy, Back to the Future, Jurassic Park, 
Terminator 2, and Shrek. There is also 
entertainment. Waterworld is a theater presentation 
which features many stunts and special effects. 
Other shows that include terrific stage effects are 
Backdraft, Animal Planet Live, and Spider Man 
Rocks. 

If all of this wasn’t enough, you can also visit the 
TV Audience Ticket Booth. Here you will get free 
tickets that will allow you to be part of the audience 
for television shows that are being taped during your 
visit. This is almost like being on TV! When you visit 
Universal Studios, you will have several days of fun, 
and you probably still won’t see everything that is 
offered.

Outside of Universal Studios you will find the 
Universal City Walk. This is Universal Studios very 
own Downtown. This is three blocks of stores, 
clubs, and restaurants for you to enjoy. There are 
no cars or motorized traffic allowed in this area, but 
there are hundreds, and sometimes thousands of 
pedestrians milling about enjoying all of the sights 
and sounds.

Universal Studio Tours is a great place to spend 
your vacation – or it is perfect as an add on to a 
Disneyland Vacation. Even if you don’t have time for 
the theme park, the Universal Studios Tour itself is 
not to be missed!
