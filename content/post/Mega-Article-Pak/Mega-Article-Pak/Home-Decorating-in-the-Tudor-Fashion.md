Home Decorating in the Tudor Fashion

Tudor style home exteriors are rather easy to identify. Many people drive by them quite regularly with jaws dropped and eyes wide at the simple beauty and elegance of this style of architecture. From humble cottages to grand castles the Tudor style of architecture is very memorable indeed. When decorating the interior of a home in the Tudor fashion there is no set in stone rules though there are some touches that are the hallmarks of Tudor style and beauty. 

One thing you can do to bring a touch of the Tudor style to your home, even if your home wasn't built in the Tudor style is to incorporate the use of beams in the interior as decorative touches. When the original Tudor style of architecture was about this was more a design of need than one of opportunity. Today the paneling serves as a simple reminder of the beauty that has earned this period in history and architecture such fame. This is only one method however, that can be used in order to establish a Tudor style upon the interior of a home.

The floors in Tudor homes were typically made of either brick or flagstone. Many people today opt for stone tiles in order to portray a remarkably accurate look with a modern twist. These floors were often covered with ornate Oriental rugs (in wealthier homes) or small wool rugs in more humble abodes. If attempting to imitate the wealthier Tudor styled homes nothing short of Oriental style rugs will do in the more prominent areas of the home. Keep in mind that there are reasonably beautiful imitations currently on the market at prices that the average homeowner can afford.

Ornate wall tapestries often graced the walls in order to complete the richness of the look in wealthier homes. This is a style that is often imitated in homes attempting to cling to their Tudor roots around the world. It is a beautiful affect however and one that is very well worth adding to your home if you are seeking to incorporate a Tudor style in your home decorating efforts. 

As far as the bedroom goes, the beds were the focal points of these rooms. Solidly built four post beds were the thrones in these homes and made fit for the king of any castle no matter how humble it may be. The posts and feet on these beds were ornately carved and quite beautiful. This is a remarkable recreation to include in your home in order to bring about an authentic Tudor atmosphere for the interior decorating. In wealthier homes, rich fabrics canopied these massive beds in order to provide privacy and elegance.

In order to create an authentic Tudor atmosphere in a home of today you would also want to incorporate some sort of wrought iron chandeliers into the home as well as wall sconces for lighting. This is the style of lighting that was often used at the time and will lend credibility to the scene you are attempting to recreate. This to me is one of the most stunning effects that can be incorporated into a home decorating plan in this day and age. If timeless beauty and elegance are the goal, then this is definitely a style of décor you will want to consider for your home.
