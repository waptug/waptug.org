Sony CMOS Sensor

Beginning with their adoption of cellular phones back
in 2002, Sony's CMOS sensors for megapixel class 
camera cell phones, and digital high definition video
cameras have become widely used in commercial products.

The greatest strength of the CMOS sensors is that
by including both digital and analog circuits on
the same chip, their readout speed can be made much
faster than the CCD.  Sony is now developing high 
speed CMOS sensors for digital cameras that will 
provide continuous imaging from all pixels at an
amazing frame rate of 60 frames.

Here recently, the trend towards higher pixel counts
in consumer digital cameras have continued, and now
it's possible to take high resolution still images
conveniently.  Until now, Sony focused efforts in
the image sensor area on increasing the pixel count
and improving the characteristics of the pixels to
achieve high resolution imaging that everyone
loves about high definition video cameras.

Sony is also aiming for an image sensor that will 
be able to capture and express surprise and emotion,
and is now putting efforts into a CMOS sensor that
can do just that.  

Even through image quality will improve as you 
increase the amount of information you capture, until
now, the still image quality of pictures has been 
improved by spatial resolution increases.  The
amount of information however, can be increased 
not only by spatial resolution increases, but also
by increasing the amount of information in the 
time direction as well.

If anything can be said about Sony technology, it
would be to never doubt it.  Sony creates very amazing
products, and are among the leaders in camera
technology today.  The CMOS sensor is just another
step for Sony in the world of high definition video
cameras, making it something you can't go wrong with.
