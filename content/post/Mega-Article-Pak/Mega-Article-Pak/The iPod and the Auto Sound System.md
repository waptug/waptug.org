The iPod and the Auto Sound System

The iPod story seems to be that of a charmed life. If you haven't taken a look around there are all kinds of devices and accessories that are created in order to use right along with the wildly popular and successful iPod product offered by Apple. In fact, I can't think of a better coup for Apple to have pulled off against the giant PC industry, even Microsoft's new product the Zune is having a great deal of difficulty even catching up to the sales that iPod seems to have no trouble garnering. The success is something that may define explanation but could have a great deal to do with the equally popular accessories and adornments that are made for each and every iPod product.

You might be wondering exactly what this has to do with auto sound systems but those are just another of the many great iPod accessories that can be found in the market place of today. Seriously! Even some car manufacturers are having upgrades that include iPod adapters that allow drivers to play music from their iPods through the tuning device on their auto sound systems. It almost seems too good to be true when you consider that you will not have to risk life and limb by fiddling with your iPod device when looking for that one obscure song somewhere on your list. There are other car stereo makers that have devices and adapters that read and play music from the iPod but you must use the actual iPod to make your selections and any changes. At any rate, when carmakers and stereo manufacturers such as Pioneer and Alpine are creating stereos that have the iPod in mind you can rest assured that it is a cultural phenomenon and not some fluke to be taken lightly.

In addition to auto sound systems you will find iDogs, iPets, iPod covers, iPod players (speakers and docking stations that you plug your iPod into in order to play without the headphones), iPod alarm clocks, and my personal favorite iBaby (this is a stroller made by Kolcraft that has an iPod, speakers, and adapter built in so that baby can hear his or her favorite tunes while being strolled about the town), or the iCrib (another nifty iPod device designed to keep baby pacified-hopefully this nifty gadgets are drool proof). Needless to say there are times in life when it's all about the accessories and I have yet seen another maker of MP3 type devices hold a torch to iPod when it comes to offering options for buyers to personalize their music makers. 

If you are in the market for an auto sound system, chances are that you either already have an iPod or are seriously not opposed to the idea of owning one. If you either or both are in your near future I highly recommend you consider purchasing an auto sound system that will be completely compatible with your iPod system or any other MP3 type player you choose to use. I do believe however, that you will find better options designed with the iPod in mind as none of the other brands (thus far) have nearly the buyer base and purchasing power of iPod owners. No matter how you feel about it, all indications are that iPods are here to stay and you may as well jump on board when it comes to your auto sound system as well.
