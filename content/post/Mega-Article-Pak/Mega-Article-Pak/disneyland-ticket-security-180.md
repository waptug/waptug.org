Disneyland Ticket Security

You must have your Disneyland ticket in order to 
enter the park. You must also have the ticket to get 
FastPass tickets. Because this ticket is so 
important, it needs to be kept in a safe place. Along 
with the Disneyland ticket, you also need a safe 
place to keep money or the Disneyland Merchandise 
Card. 

A wallet or purse is not very practical at Disneyland. 
Instead, you should purchase a FastPass holder – 
even if you don’t get any FastPasses. This is a small 
plastic pouch that hangs from a cord, which is worn 
around the neck. These can be purchased at 
Disneyland, and they are very inexpensive. 

If you think you might not want to spend a little bit of 
money on the FastPass holder, you should consider 
what a new Disneyland ticket will cost. If you lose 
your Disneyland ticket, you will not be allowed to 
enter the park the next day without purchasing a new 
ticket. When you look at the small cost of the 
Disneyland FastPass holder, you will see that it is
well worth it.
