The Cons of Chartering a Private Yacht

Are you interested in chartering a private yacht for a family vacation, romantic getaway, honeymoon, or business trip?  If you are, have you already made your reservations? If you have yet to do so, you may want to take a few minutes and thoroughly examine your decision to charter a private yacht.  While there are an unlimited number of benefits or pros to chartering a private yacht, there are also a number of cons.  These cons, which are also often referred to as disadvantages, are outlined below.

In the United States and all across the country, there are a large number of private yacht companies that can be found.  When you actually think about it, private yacht chartering companies operate in a number of different areas, all around the world.  After a close examination, you will see that many of these areas are also popular vacation destinations, such as Florida, the Caribbean, or the Bahamas.  While this is good news, it might not be if you are looking to explore a relatively unknown area of the world or even just an unpopular one.  If you are unable to find a private yacht available in the area that you would like to visit, you may have to change your destination.

In a way, the chartering of a private yacht is considered a service.  In today’s society, it is not uncommon to find scams that are centered on the purchase of an item or service.  Although it is relatively uncommon to hear of a private yacht scam, they do exisit.  Of course, being scammed can be considered a con or a disadvantage of trying to charter a private yacht, but it doesn’t have to be. There are a number of things that you can do to decrease or completely eliminate your chances of being scammed by a yacht company.  First, you will want to thoroughly examine or research that company. Be on the lookout for any negative feedback or bad reviews.  It is also important that you be careful with how you pay.  Most established yacht chartering companies will request that you pay a deposit upfront, but you shouldn’t have to pay in full upfront.  

Another one of the few cons, to chartering a private yacht, is availability. As it was previously mentioned, there are a large number of private yacht chartering companies that can be found all around the world, but many of those locations are also considered popular vacation destinations, like the Caribbean. Since these are popular vacation destinations, there will be an increased competition for the chartering of yachts.  In these instances, it is also not uncommon to find individuals who want to charter or rent a yacht for only a day or two, instead of an extended time like most.  As with many of the other yacht chartering cons, this con can easily be turned into a pro.  If you would like to make sure that you get a reservation, you will just need to make your reservations in advance; the earlier the better.

It is also important to note the rules and restrictions that may exist.  A large number of private yacht chartering companies have a number of rules, restrictions, and guidelines that their passengers must follow. The good news is that you should be made aware of these rules up front.  Just a few of the many rules that you may find aboard a privately chartered yacht include the supervision of children at all times, the banning of pets onboard, as well as the proper training or certification before going scuba diving out in the ocean.  In all honesty, the rules that are enforced will all depend on the yacht chartering company in question.  If you are looking for the smallest number of rules and restrictions, you just need to find a yacht chartering company that is more lax on their rules.  It may take you a little bit of time to do, but it is possible to find these types of companies.

As you can see, there are a number of different disadvantages or cons to chartering a private yacht.  While there are quite a few cons, it is also important to remember that there are a number of pros.  Just a few of these pros are the cost, the lack of work, and the activities that you can participate in on and off the yacht.
