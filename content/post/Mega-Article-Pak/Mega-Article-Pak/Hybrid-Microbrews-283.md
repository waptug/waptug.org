Hybrid Microbrews

Cream ale/American lager/blonde ale
This blend produces a mild, pale, light bodied ale.
This can be made using a warm fermentation (either
top or bottom) and cold lagering or also by 
blending top and bottom fermented beers.

The hop bitterness in the style is normally very
low, with hip aroma often absent.  Sometimes they
are referred to as cream ales, yet they are crisp
and very refreshing.

American wheat ale/American wheat lager
This type of beer can be made by using either lager
yeast or an ale.  Brewed with 50 percent wheat, 
the hop rates are higher and the carbonation is
lower than German styles of wheat beers.  

At low levels, a fruity estery aroma and flavor
is normal, although clovelike characteristics 
shouldn't be perceived.  The color is normally
golden to light amber, with the body being light
to medium in character.

Fruit beers
These types of beers are made by using fruit as
an adjunct in the primary or secondary fermentation.
Fruit beers provide a very unique taste, and
they can also be quite potent if made in the right
ways.

Vegetable beers
These beers use vegetables as an adjunct in primary
or secondary fermentation, helping to provide an
obvious, yet harmonious quality.  These beers 
shouldn't be overpowered by hop character.

Herb and spice beers
Herb and spice beers use either herbs or spices
other than hops to create a very distinct taste
and character.  The spices can be derived from roots,
seeds, fruits, vegetables, and flowers.  

Hybrid microbrews offer you a break from the 
ordinary beers, providing unique tastes and very
distinct character.  There are many types of hybrid
microbrews available, all you have to do is look
around or experiment.
