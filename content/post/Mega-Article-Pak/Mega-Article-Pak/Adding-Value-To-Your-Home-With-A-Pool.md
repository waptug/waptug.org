Adding Value To Your Home With A Pool

Even though swimming pools are mostly though of as enjoyment, exercise, and relaxing on hot days, they are also a great way to enhance the value of your home.  If you’ve thought of selling your home or just enhancing the value, a swimming pool may very well be a wise investment.  

In ground pools are a great way to add to the value of your home.  They may cost a lot of money, although they come in a variety of different shapes and sizes, and they also give you the most versatility.  You can choose to have a shallow end for children and those who are learning to swim, then add a deep end on the other side for diving boards and lap swimming.

Above ground swimming pools on the other hand are much cheaper, although they require a deck and privacy fencing for those who want their privacy.  Adding a deck around your above ground pool will raise the value of your home as well.  Even though above ground pools aren’t that deep, they are great enjoying yourself on a hot day, or just getting out there and splashing water with your family and friends.

Instead of going with a swimming pool, you can also choose a hot tub.  Hot tubs cost quite a bit of money, although they are an excellent way to relax.  Hot tubs have been well known over the years to enhance the value of property.  You can relax in a heated hot tub with your other half, or just let your kids relax in the tub with non heated water.

Even though a hot tub is a great investment, most people looking to add value to their home choose to go with an in ground swimming pool.  In ground pools cost the most money, adding instant value to your home.  If you are planning to install an in ground pool, you should pay very close to the location, as this will impact the value.  Normally, in ground pools work the best and bring the most value if they are installed behind your home, with a fence going around them.

Keep in mind, that installing an in ground pool will take quite a bit of time.  It also involves digging up your yard, which is why you want to select a location for it where nothing runs under the ground.  When your contractor looks at your property before installing the pool, he will go over that sort of thing with you.  Once the pool is installed and everything is set up, you should have your home appraised and see what the value is.  Truth be told - you may find yourself simply amazed at just how much value a pool can add to your home.
