Oreck XL Ultra

Controlling allergens at home is very important for
allergy sufferers.  For this reason, many allergy
sufferers rely on the Oreck XL Ultra.  This hypo-
allergenic vacuum is used to clean embedded dirt and
and allergens from carpets and hardwood floors.  It
will remove almost 99.9% percent of allergins, with
the inner and outer bag working together as a great
filtration system.

One of the best things about the XL Ultra is the 
fact that it will lock dirt and debris inside of 
the disposable dust bag.  The patented Saniseal
system will keep it there, preventing any type of
contamination.  You'll never come in contact with
the dust, as the Saniseal system locks dirt and
dust in tight so it has no way to escape.  Once
the bag is full, you simply toss it out and put a 
new one - that simple!

The new base plate design of the Oreck XL Ultra 
features larger, more robust front wheels, more
edge brushes, and microsweep technology.  These
improvements will increase edge cleaning on 
bare floors and carpets, increase dirt removal on
bare floors, and also makes the vacuum much easier
to manuever on both carpet and tile.

As we all know, housework is hard.  If you want your
home to stay clean, then you'll have to vacuum as
often as you can.  The Oreck XL weighs in at 8
pounds, with roller brushes that spin at the speed
of 6,500 RPM.  You can pick up all of the dirt
in one pass, including pet hair, dander, pollen,
dust, and also dust mites.  You'll get the surface
dirt and the embedded dirt, which make your 
house smell as good as it looks.

The XL Ultra is so good that it will lay flat to
fit under beds and furniture for easy storage.
It is one of the lightest full size vacuums
available, with stairs being a snap.  You can
easily go from carpets to bare floors, as the 
Oreck XL will recognize the thickness of the
carpet and adjust itself automatically.  With 
bare floors, the Microsweep system will deliver
millions of strokes a minute.  It moves so quick
that it will actually scoop up sand off of a bare
floor.

The sheer genius of Oreck technology has always 
been to take the heavy vacuum cleaners and then
reduce them to light, lean, and very easy to 
clean machines.  The Oreck XL Ultra has state
of the art 24 bar technology that makes it run
powerfully, quiet, and will keep running as long
as you need it.

The 24 bar motor in the XL Ultra uses 1/3 the
electricity of any other vacuum motor out there.
Not only will it last longer, it will pay for
itself in the long run with energy savings.

When you talk about performance, the XL Ultra's
suction velocity is equivalent to a category 2
hurricane, which measures at 102 MPH!  This type 
of suction is among the best, as very few 
vacuum cleaners out there can compete with it.

The roller brush with thread guard system will
nearly eliminate hair and thread from getting
tangled up in the bearings.  The roller brush
features a hardwood maple roller that increases
durability, picking up almost anything that it
comes in contact with.

If you've been looking for a better vacuum cleaner,
you can rest assured that the Oreck XL Ultra is
everything you need.  This vacuum cleaner will
do it all and then some, making your housework
easier than it has ever been in the past.
