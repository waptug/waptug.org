Making Money From Content Rich Sites

Making money from a content rich niche marketing website can be very easy, very difficult or impossible. First let’s define and describe what a content rich niche market website is and how it works. You won’t find a list for “Niche Markets” anywhere. There isn’t one. 

A person will find niche marketers when he types words into his favorite search engine and hits search. Let’s say he types in “Improving my golf score”. He will get many hits that will provide links that take him to niche marketing sites. On these sites, he will be asked to enter his email address and opt-in to receiving a newsletter. Since he is in need of learning how to improve his golf score, he willingly does that. On the content rich site he will find articles and other information about improving his golf score and advertisements for products and services designed to help him improve his golf score.  In the future he will receive a newsletter, about every two weeks usually, and he will have become a niche market customer. 

If you are the niche marketer, the opt-in email address supplied is pure gold because you will have a customer or a potential customer. When he buys the products and/or services that you are advertising on your site, you will make money. Having a content rich site enhances the possibility of sales. 

The trick to making money from a content rich niche marketing website is to have a topic that helps people solve their problems, makes them feel better or look better, or supplies them with information that they need. You will need to have related products and services advertised on your site since that is where the income actually comes from. The website content is what makes people visit your site again and again. The more content rich it is will determine how often they visit and how long they stay. The longer they stay the more opportunities you have to sell to them.
