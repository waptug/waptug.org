Think Safety when you Operate Power Tools

Most of us have operated a power tool at one time or another. They come in handy for a wide range of projects. It is very important that you always operate any power tool correctly. You should know exactly what it is to be used for, how it operates, and where the power switch is located in case you have to turn it off in a hurry. 

Most injuries that involve power tools are the result of someone being inexperienced with that particular power tool or the tool being used for something it was not intended for. Take your time when you are operating power tools. Don’t let yourself become distracted. Always be aware of your surroundings and the potential for accidents and injuries. They can happen no matter how many times you have picked up that power tool and used it without incident. 

Cords are a common hazard when operating power tools. They can get in the way and accidentally get severed. There is also the potential of tripping over them and getting injured. Make sure all power cords are secured and out of the area where you will be operating the power tool. Keep all cords out of water and away from solvents or you could get shocked or electrocuted. 

If you have never operated a particular power tool before, take your time getting familiar with it before you even plug it in. Read the owners manual that comes with the power tool. Find out about the types of blades and other accessories that can safely be used with it. If the power tool comes with any type of safety guard, take the time to put it in place. You will find information in the owner’s manual regarding possible safety hazards. 

No matter how tempting it may be, never use a power tool for a project that it wasn’t intended for. This includes trying to cut materials with a saw or saw blade that was not designed for it. Don’t alter a power tool to make it faster or to do something that it wasn’t designed for. You really don’t know the effect that is going to have on the operating capacity of the power tool. 

It is never a good idea to operate any type of power tool if you have been consuming alcohol. Your perception will be off and you could end up with a very serious injury. Some prescription medications and over the counter medications can made you groggy or sleepy as a side effect. You should stay away from power tools while taking them as well.

Some people just don’t feel comfortable operating power tools. That is fine, and you shouldn’t feel forced into doing so. This is just opening the door for potential accidents to happen. If you are willing to learn to operate specific power tools that is one thing, but if you feeling pressured to do so you are going to have too much anxiety to operate it. 

Using power tools safely and under the right conditions will help reduce the possibility of any injuries occurring. They are a great way to get your projects and hobbies underway, but never forget the actual power behind them. The moving parts combined with that power can result in injury or death if you don’t follow the manufacturer’s instructions for operating them.
