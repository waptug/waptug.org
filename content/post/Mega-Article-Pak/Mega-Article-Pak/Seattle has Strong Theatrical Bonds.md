Seattle has Strong Theatrical Bonds

If you love the theatre, and by love I mean a deep and abiding love for old and new alike, film and stage, then visiting Seattle might be a great idea for you and your vacation needs. Seattle has so much to offer the theatre buff that it is really frightening that one little town (well not so little really) that far west of New York could support the theatrical community that this city has. 

Below I will provide a small sampling of the many theatres that abound in this great city. First of all there's the 5th Avenue Theatre. With a tradition of vaudeville and silent films this theatre with an interior inspired by Beijing's Forbidden City, the 5th Avenue Theatre is Seattle's Premier Showplace. One of the great things about this theatre is that throughout the year they hold behind the scenes spotlight nights where they tell a little bit about the magic of theatre or the story behind the stories they are performing. These spotlight nights are free of charge and very well received. I highly recommend attending one of these if you have the opportunity.

If you want dinner theatre with a little bit of everything in between, then maybe you should check out Teatre Zin Zanni. This is a three-hour event that is served with a five-course meal. This show seriously has a little bit of everything. From singers and dancers, to acrobats and comedians, this show is sure to dazzle the entire audience. While the show is top notch, the food cannot be described as anything other than gourmet. With a meal like this and great entertainment too, who could really ask for more from a night on the town. And you get all of this in one great place. This is an evening that will definitely be remembered long after your trip has ended.

The Iniman Theatre goes for a more intimate approach when dealing with the audience. By having smaller performance space with close seating, every member of the audience is allowed a much more up close and personal view of the stage and the drama being performed. Special opportunities are created to allow audience members and patrons to have a more personal behind the scenes look at the production, even allowing some to sit in on technical rehearsals or post-play discussions. This is a great way to build a bond between the actors and the audience, particularly if the audience is made up largely of patrons or members who come to the theatre on a regular basis. 

The Paramount is a different and unique theater. One of the special things about this particular theater is the phenomenal architecture. This theater has a fully automated adjustable floor that allows easy conversion from theater auditorium seating to ballroom seating. This means that those planning events here have more options available for seating guests. On the first Saturday of every month the Seattle Theatre Group gives public tours of the theatre, which allows the public to get a behind the scenes look at how this great theatre operates these tours are free. Another really cool thing about this particular theatre is Silent Movie Mondays. On Monday nights you can see different silent movies playing throughout the year. 

Theatre has played an important role in the lives of many and if you are one who really has a passion for good theatre, then Seattle really is your city. You won't have the prices to deal with that you would have in certain other cities, but you will still be able to appreciate the best that local talent has to offer and more as some of these theatres have traveling shows that have played on or slightly off Broadway that will travel the country in order to increase interest in their shows in New York. Regardless of whether you are getting local talent or the big guns, you are most likely in for quite a night of fun.
