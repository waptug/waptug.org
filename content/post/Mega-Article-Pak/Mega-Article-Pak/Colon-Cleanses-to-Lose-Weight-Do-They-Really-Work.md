Before understanding how colon cleanses may help you lose weight, it is important to remember that there may be a variance. There are some colon cleanses that advertise that they are designed to help you lose weight. These types of colon cleanses are also commonly referred to as weight loss cleanses. With that in mind, there are colon cleanses that advertise that they are not guaranteed to help you lose weight, even though some of them may.

When using a colon cleanse, it is important that you follow all of the instructions given to you. For instance, there are some colon cleanses that require that you do not eat anything for one or two days.  These types of colon cleanses are often ones that are in liquid format.  The colon cleanses in pill format may request that you only eat and drink certain products, like fruits and vegetables.  If you buy a colon cleanse that asks to you restrict your diet, you are advised to do so.  This diet restriction is what makes it possible for you to lose weight, as well as allow the colon cleanse to properly work.

When you use a colon cleanse, you are essentially detoxifying, your body.  The colon cleanse will work to push toxins out from your colon and sometimes even your intestines.  This is not only ideal to promote a healthy wellbeing, but it can also help you lose weight.

If you are able to use a rapid colon cleanse, like one that works in three to seven days, you may notice a rapid weight loss. There are some individuals who use colon cleanses to quickly lose weight before a special event like a wedding or a vacation. While you may be able to achieve rapid weight loss with a colon cleanse, it is important that you proceed with caution.  If you do not change the way that you eat or add exercise to your daily activities, you may see your weight add back on it as little as a few weeks or a few days. This typically happens if you were asked to restrict your diet when using a colon cleanse.  While you do not have to keep up with your restricted diet, you are advised to reduce your junk food intake and start a daily or at least a weekly exercise program.

Since it is more than possible for you to lose weight with a colon cleanse, you may be interested in giving one a try.
