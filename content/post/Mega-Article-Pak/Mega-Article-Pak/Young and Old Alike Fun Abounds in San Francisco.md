Young and Old Alike: Fun Abounds in San Francisco

San Francisco is one of those rare cities that offers almost timeless appeal. One of the greatest things that can be said about this great city is that the things that attract its youngest visitors are also quite often the things that bring in its older visitors.

In fact, the very museums that fascinate youngsters have lessons to teach their older visitors as well. Art is a common language among us all and the entertainment that can be found in this great city from opera, symphonies, concerts, plays, and musicals, to street entertainment are both top notch and appealing to people from all sorts of backgrounds and circumstances. 

The diversity of this great city is as much a part of its appeal as are the attractions that are designed to bring in visitors. Perhaps one of the most attractive draws to this city for older audiences is the significant history of this city and its people. There are many places-museums and galleries, where you can learn about the history and tragedies that this city has endured, overcome, and now celebrate as part of its heritage. 

The cultural diversity that this city offers is also a large draw to older populations. From the Asian history and culture, to the Latin history and culture, to the African American this city celebrates it all. I think that is my favorite thing about this city. It celebrates the good and the bad of its history side by side. Not many places on earth can do that, much less do it as effectively as San Francisco does.

In addition to all of these things, which are quite appealing in and of themselves, San Francisco has the trolley tours, Alcatraz Island tours, the Presidio, The conservatory of flowers at Golden Gate Park, Wine Tasting and winery tours, concerts and cultural events, plays and musicals, as well as Thoroughbred racing at Golden Gate Fields.

There are so many activities that are available in San Francisco that it is quite difficult to narrow them down to what you can actually do in the span of a few days. If you want to feel young again take a tour of Pier 39 at Fisherman's Wharf. Try taking a tour of Filoli Estates in order to see how the other half live. If you are feeling particularly playful head out for a day at the Exploratorium, this great place isn't only for kids. 

You can also take a tour of Hearst Castle. This castle was the dream home of William Randolph Hearst, and whose dream wouldn't it be? With 165 rooms and 127 acres to explore this tour could be an excellent way to spend the day. One feature of the tour that will be sure to please is the film "Hearst Castle-Building the Dream" that tells a little more about the man and his castle.

Another really neat attraction for more mature audiences is the Old Faithful Geyser of California. This is a little off the beaten path as it is located around an hour and a half north of the city but if you like nature and serenity it is worth a detour. 

If you like nature you may want to try one of the train tours offered by Roaring Camp Railroads, or both. There are two different tours offered you will want to be sure to check for times. Also keep in mind that during the month of December there is a special Holiday Train Lights Train and reservations must be made in advance for that special ride. 

As I was saying, there is a little something for everyone in the great city of San Francisco and just because something appeals to a much younger crowd, in no way indicates that it can't appeal just as well to an older or young again crowd. I remember some of the things that fascinated me most as a child still spark those feelings of happiness and joy (we won't say how many) years later. The important thing is to choose the activities that appeal most to you and try to enjoy yourself as much as possible. It shouldn't be too hard!
