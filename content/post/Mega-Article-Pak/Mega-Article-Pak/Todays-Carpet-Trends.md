Todays Carpet Trends

Going beyond beige
Long ago, when the choices of carpet were limited
to basic beige, the designers tended to treat it
more often than not as a neutral background for
rooms.  These days, with numerous patterns, textures,
and colors to choose from, the carpet is quickly
emerging as the focal point in many interior
designs.

Although you may think the need for neutral carpet
has faded away, it hasn't, as Berber is still an
excellent choice.  Unlike the plain choices of the
early 1990s, the versions of today offer more 
pattern and texture.  Even the traditional types
of Berber carpet offer more visual interest with 
more extreme differences in pile being cut thicker,
with deeper loop textures.

Color being sprinkled against a neutral background
will add interest and dimension while helping to
mask spots and spills.  The flecks of color are
now appearing against tan, beige, and cream type
backgrounds as well as in other neutrals as well.

Colors and textures
The major shift in new products is going towards
layered color and softer texture in carpet.  The
combination of pattern and texture will always
be a popular choice simply because it minimizes
soil and vacuum marks.  The other advantage here
is that the color and texture offer a more
distinct styling and plenty of fashion appeal
as well.

The new products are rapidly changing the 
perception of carpet as not only being a 
background to showcase other furnishings to
the possibility that the carpet can become a
focus for design as well.

Construction
The new manufacturing capabilities have produced
several new looks with carpets that are constructed
with cut and loop yarns.  Some examples include
bows, swirls, lattices, plaids, pin dots, and
several others.

By taking advantage of these choices, you can add
a great deal of interest to the room and in 
sequence with the florals, stripes, and other 
patterns on windows and furniture.  The carpet
pattern and texture will also increase the
perception of quality and value in the carpet,
and will add a much broader element to the 
surroundings as well.

These days, carpets can do more than just protect
your sub floor.  They can add a new level of
comfort and warmth to your home, with literally
thousands of choices available.  Carpet is
easier than ever to clean as well, making it
more than worth worthy of being in your home.

With several different trends and new and exciting
colors to choose from, the carpets of today
can make your house come alive.  The carpets
will add new meaning to your rooms, making you
appreciate your home even more.  If you have
older carpet in your home now, you shouldn't
wait another minute to upgrade.  Once you take
a look at all of the choices you have, you'll
want to get that new carpet in now - as your
floor with want to thank you as well!
