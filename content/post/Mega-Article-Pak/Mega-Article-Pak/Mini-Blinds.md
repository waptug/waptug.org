Mini Blinds

If you enjoy the practical and enjoy efficiency, then
the mini blind is going to be your ideal choice of
window covering.  When choosing a blind, you should
take several factors into account, such as the 
appearance, privacy, cost, light control, ease of
use, and the ability to insulate.

Mini blinds are inexpensive and can easily fulfill
all of the considerations above.  They are also
easy to use as well as efficient.  You can also use
mini blinds in conjunction with other types of 
window coverings and window treatments, and they 
come available in an amazing array of color choices.

If you are new to the world of mini blinds and 
their installation, you'll find them to be very 
easy to install.  Something to keep in mind, which
is a common mistake of the window treating novice
is measuring incorrectly - you should always list 
the width first in writing the measurement.  Then,
when you order any blinds, be sure to give the
width first and not the height.

Also referred to as aluminum blinds and Venetian
blinds, mini blinds offer a curved slat for extra
strength. The most standard and practical choice 
of mini blinds is the 1" aluminum blind.  

You should look for a finish that is built to 
spring back, durable, and resistant to both dust
and static.  Another stylish option to mini blinds
is the 1 3/8" aluminum blind.  This type of blind
delivers a bold statement, yet it has the same
practical features that make mini blinds appealing.

For a look and style you really can't go wrong 
with, mini blinds are the way to go.  They are
very affordable, offer you an array of features,
and they will improve the look of your home.
