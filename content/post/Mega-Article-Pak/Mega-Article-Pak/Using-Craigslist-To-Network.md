Using Craigslist to Network

Networking is an important part of any business and Craigslist offers individuals a variety of networking opportunities. Whether you have an established business and are looking to advertise, you are looking to learn more about a particular business or you just want to meet individuals who share a particular interest, Craigslist can be an excellent resource. Craigslist offers all of these opportunities and more to those who are interested in starting to network or expanding their networking capabilities. 

Using Craigslist to Organize Offline Networking Opportunities

Organizing offline networking opportunities is just one of the many ways in which individuals can use Craigslist for networking purposes. One example of when this type of opportunity may be worthwhile is for a situation where a businessperson is in the line of direct sales. Often these direct sales opportunities involve the individual hosting parties where others can sample and learn more about the products offered. These types of parties can be very lucrative for a skilled salesperson that has a passion for the products they are selling. 

Examples of the types of businesses which benefit from sales parties include direct sales opportunities including cosmetics, toys, pet products, romance items, nutritional supplements and other products. Whether the products are so wonderful they literally sell themselves or they require a skilled salesperson to convince the audience of their worth, the most important part of direct sales is networking. This is where Craigslist can really help. Those who are interested in organizing sales parties can take advantage of the large number of community members reached by Craigslist to find new potential clients. Placing an advertisement in an appropriate section on Craigslist gives the salesperson the ability to reach a large target audience. 

The one major caveat to using Craigslist to organize offline networking opportunities is care should be taken to ensure the safety of all of those involved. When setting up offline meetings, sales parties or other networking opportunities it is wise to arrange for these meetings to take place in a busy public place. This will help to deter the possibility of a potentially dangerous situation. It will also help to put potential clients more at ease and make them more likely to participate in your networking opportunity. 

Using Craigslist to Organize Online Networking Opportunities

Craigslist can also be used to organize online networking opportunities. Examples of the ways in which Craigslist can be used to organize online network include the following:

* Directing traffic to a website
* Directing traffic to a message board
* Soliciting participation in an e-newsletter

Those who sell a product or service through an ecommerce website may be interested in using Craigslist to advertise their web address. An advertisement which is placed in an appropriate location on Craigslist can have the effect of reaching a very large audience. The appropriateness of the location on the advertisement depends on a number of factors. In general an appropriate location is anywhere on Craigslist where the advertisement is likely to be viewed by a large amount of members of the target audience. 

Those who are interested in organizing online networking opportunities for likeminded individuals to share ideas can also use Craigslist to accomplish their goal. Placing an advertisement on Craigslist which directs traffic to a message board can help to create a thriving community. Again it is important to place this advertisement in a location where the target audience will be reached. 

Finally, those who publish a regular e-newsletter can also use Craigslist to increase their number of subscribers. Whether the e-newsletter is published daily, weekly, monthly or according to some other schedule Craigslist can be used to solicit email addresses from those who might be interested in receiving these newsletters. 

Using Craigslist to Find Networking Opportunities

Craigslist is not only useful in situations where individuals are seeking to organize networking opportunities. It can also be helpful for individuals who are looking to join pre-existing networking opportunities. These individuals would benefit from following links pointing to websites or message boards placed in advertisements throughout the community.
