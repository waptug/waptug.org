Professional Wart Removal:  What You Should Know

In the United States, a large number of individuals develop warts on their body. Warts, although they can be unpleasant, are almost always harmless. Despite being harmless, there are many men, women, and children who wish to have their warts removed.  If you are undergoing a wart removal for the first time, you may want to think about visiting a professional healthcare worker.  Many individuals feel more comfortable undergoing their first removal when it is done by a professional.

Despite having your warts removed by a professional, there are a number of important factors that you should take into consideration.  One of those factors is the type of doctor you plan on using. If you have a primary healthcare physician, a doctor that you see on a regular basis, you may be able to have your wart or warts removed by that doctor. Although a large number of primary care physicians do remove warts, there are some who do not. If your doctor does not perform any wart removal procedures, they will likely refer you to someone else who does. That person may be a dermatologist; a professional skin doctor.

In addition to the type of healthcare professional you plan on visiting, it is also important to consider the removal method that will be used. This is important because your body may have a negative reaction to certain removal methods.  Perhaps, that is why you are advised to try and schedule an appointment with your primary care physician; they tend to know your medical history. Before undergoing any treatment, regardless of whether or not you are a new patient, you are advised to inform your physician or dermatologist of any medical complications or allergies that you may have.  This information may not only have an impact on the success of the wart removal, but it may also have an impact on your health.

As mentioned above, most warts are completely harmless. This is because almost all warts are considered non-cancerous growths.  Despite being relatively harmless, your wart may be tested.  Primary care physicians do not always test warts, unless they are given a cause for concern. On the other hand, dermatologists are healthcare professionals that have a focus on skin and everything that is associated with it. For that reason, there is a good chance that a dermatologist will test your wart or warts. This is completely normal; therefore, you do not need to be alarmed if your wart is taken for a biopsy. 

After the procedure has ended, your primary care physician or dermatologist will likely provide you with a set of instructions.  These instructions will most likely tell you how to properly care for your wound.  This is extremely important. Many individuals do not realize that wart removal procedures may result in scaring, even those that are professionally done.  However, the scarring doesn’t always depend on the procedure used; it tends to depend on the care given to the wound afterwards.  That is why it is important that you follow all directions given to you by your doctor. These directions may include keeping your wound covered at all times or the application of a skincare cream. 

By keeping the above mentioned points in mind, you should be able to know what to expect when you go to have your wart or warts professionally removed. If you would like more information on the process, as well as any precautionary measures that you should take, you are advised to contact your primary care physician or the dermatologist, which you plan on visiting.
