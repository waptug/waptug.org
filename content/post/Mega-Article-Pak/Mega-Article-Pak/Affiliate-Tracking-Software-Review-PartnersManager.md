Affiliate Tracking Software Review:  PartnersManager

Online, you will find a large number of affiliate tracking software programs.  If you are a business owner who is looking to start your own affiliate program, you will need to familiarize yourself with all of these programs. When searching for affiliate tracking software, you will be presented with so many choices that you may not know which type of software is best for your needs.  The first step is to determine what you need and want to get out of affiliate tracking software and then find the program that can give you that.

In your search, it is likely that you will come across PartnersManager Affiliate Software. Whether you are the owner of a large or small online business, you may find that this software program has exactly what you need. However, it is not safe to assume that it is.  Instead, you will want to further examine the PartnersManager Affiliate Software.  When doing so, you will want to examine the software requirements and the services and features that are included with the program.

PartnersManager Affiliate Software requires that your system have a PHP of at least 4.1.0.  It is also required that you have MySQL, version 3.23 or higher, and a MySQL database.  For a web service, it is advised that you have IIS or Apache.  Since the aforementioned computer specifications are considered requirements, you will need them to run the program.  If your computer is not equipped to handle the PartnersManager Affiliate Software, but you want this particular affiliate tracking software program, you are advised to update your computer to meet their standards.

When examining any affiliate tracking software, including the PartnersManager Affiliate Software, you are advised to examine what the program will require you to do. This often includes setup and installation.  What is nice about PartnersManager is that they provide you with downloadable user manuals and demos before you even signup for their program.  This is important because not all software providers do this, even though they should. Perhaps, user manuals and demos are the best way to determine whether or not the PartnersManager Affiliate Software is what you need.

With PartnersManager Affiliate Software, a detailed user guide will not be all that you will receive.  Once you signup for the software service, you will find that a lot is included in their purchase price.  For instance, all subscribers will be able to receive three free months of customer support.  These three months are just enough time for you to familiarize yourself with the software and learn to use it without assistance.  Other common features, such as cookie enabled software and detailed earnings reports, are included with this affiliate tracking software.

Unlike other affiliate tracking software, PartnersManager also gives you the option to try their service for free.  This free trial is for a one month period.  After the trail period has ended, you can determine whether or not you would like to continue on with a paid membership. This effective, but easy to use software program is what so many business owners want and need that many continue on with the paid service.  If you decide to do that too, you will only have to pay a onetime license fee; there will be no monthly payments required. You will also receive free software updates whenever they become available. 

PartnersManager has and is still used by many online business owners.  Of course, that does not necessarily mean that the program will be right for you; however, with a little bit of research, you should easily be able to determine if it is.
