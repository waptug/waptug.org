Uploading Files to MySpace

MySpace websites can be created without only the use of solid background colors and text. However, this type of website is not likely to be very interesting. MySpace is an online community which is designed to be a place where members can make new friends, reconnect with long lost friends, network, share ideas or opinions or even meet potential romantic partners. This social aspect of the community makes it almost necessary for members to design websites which accurately represent their personalities. One of the easiest ways members can sow off their personality is through the inclusion of photos on their MySpace website. These photos may be pictures of the members or other photos which provide insight into the member’s personality. 

Tips for Uploading Photos to MySpace

One of the most important things to remember when uploading files to MySpace is that these files may be seen by many people. This is especially important for those who are uploading pictures of themselves to place on their MySpace website. Members are not required to place a photo of themselves on their profile but many users do include a photo so those who visit their website have a visual image of the member. Users may place an embarrassing photo of themselves thinking only their friends will see this photo but in reality many other members and nonmembers may view this photo as well. This other members may include potential bosses, neighbors or others who might be shocked by these photos.

Parents of children who use MySpace should also exercise caution when allowing their children to post their photos on their MySpace profile. There are many harmful predators on the Internet and many of these predators are seeking young children to prey upon. Parents should carefully consider whether or not they want to allow their child to add a picture to their profile. Alternately, parents might recommend their children use a picture that represents a hobby of theirs or a favorite cartoon character instead of their own photo. When posting a picture of an object or character care should be taken to ensure posting the photo is not a violation of copyrights associated with the photo. 

Uploading Photos and Videos to MySpace

Uploading photos to your MySpace account is fairly simple. First you must log into your account and then click on the links that says, “Add/edit photos.” You then receive a warning stating that photos which include nudity, violent or offensive materials or copyrighted images are not permitted. You are also given the option of making photos visible to only you or to everyone. You can then browse through your hard drive to find the desired photo. Photos uploaded to MySpace must be .gif or .jpg format and must be smaller than 600k. Once you find an appropriate photo, click upload and the photo will be added to your account. Once a photo is added you can create a caption for this photo. 

MySpace members can search through existing video clips on MySpace to find video clips to add to their website. They can also upload their own videos for use on their website and for others to share. When uploading videos to MySpace, members should be sure to read the terms and conditions to ensure the video they are posting is permissible. Uploading pornography or other objectionable materials may result in the member having his MySpace account deleted.
