Universal Studios Tours Hotels

When planning your Universal Studios Tours 
vacation, you may wish to stay at a hotel that is 
within walking distance of the park. There are only 
two hotels within walking distance, and they are 
both world-class hotels that are highly 
recommended.

The Universal Sheraton Hotel is located at 333 
Universal Hollywood Drive. The hotel has served 
visitors to Universal Studios since 1969, and it is 
known as the Hotel of the Stars. The hotel literally 
sits on the back lot of the studio.

Featuring 436 guest rooms and suites, the hotel 
often has many famous guests. There is no telling 
who you might run into! Although it is in walking 
distance of Universal Studios, the hotel staff believe 
that everyone should be treated like a star, and 
therefore, complimentary tram rides to the park are 
offered.

The guest rooms feature high speed Internet 
access, air conditioning, an alarm clock, cable 
television, and a coffee maker. Hotel services 
include a valet service, a business center and 
business services, a car rental service, a concierge 
service, and room service. There are 21 meeting 
rooms on the property, as well as a lobby lounge 
and the Baja Beach Club Poolside Lounge.

The Hotel of the Stars is the most popular hotel to 
stay at, but if there are no rooms available, you 
should consider the Universal City Hilton Hotel. The 
Universal City Hilton is located at 555 Universal 
Hollywood Drive. The Hilton offers guests fine dining 
in several on site restaurants, and has several 
lounges on the property as well. The hotel features 
a health and fitness center, a business center, and 
deluxe room accommodations. Each guest room 
at the Universal City Hilton features a view of the 
Hollywood Hills, including the San Fernando Valley 
and Universal Studios.

These two hotels are highly recommended by 
Universal Studios due to their close proximity and 
the high level of quality guest amenities and service. 
Because of their popularity, you should book your 
trip well in advance, and make sure that you make 
any special requests for additional amenities or 
services at the time that you make your reservation.

Other hotels are available within driving distance of 
Universal Studios Tours, but if possible, you should 
plan to stay at one of these fine hotels. Again, the 
proximity to the park and level of quality service 
cannot be topped. You may also be able to get a 
special rate on Universal Studios tickets at the 
Concierge’s desk of either hotel.
