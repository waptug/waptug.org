Social Networking Websites:  How to Find Them

Each day, in the United States, millions of Americans communicate with each other online. In addition to communicating with other Americans, many are communicating with those on the other side of the world. This communication is due, largely in part, to online social networking websites.  If you are interested in joining the growing number of internet users who use social networking websites, you will have to find a network to join.

When it comes to finding social networking websites, you have a number of different options.  Perhaps, the easiest way to find a social networking website is by performing a standard internet search. You may want to search with the words social networking or social networking websites. Whichever search phrase you choose, there is a good chance that you will be presented with a long list of websites.  

You can also find and familiarize yourself with social networking websites by talking to those that you know. The internet, as well as social networks, has rapidly increased in popularity. That popularity means that there is a good chance that one of your relatives, friends, coworkers, or neighbors has used a specific social networking website in the past.  In fact, many may have even used more than one.  If you know someone who has, you will want to ask them their recommendations.  You will find that most social networking websites come highly rated, but there are some out there that may not even be worth your time.

In addition to speaking to those that you actually know, you can also seek recommendations from those that you do not personally know.  You can do this online.  Online, you should be able to find a number of websites that discuss social networking sites.  Many of these websites have reviewed a collection of social networking sites.  In addition to reviews and other articles, you should also be able to speak with other internet users on online message boards.  Like speaking to one of your friends, many internet users would be more than willing to let you know what social networking websites are worth the time and which ones are not.

Although it is nice to receive recommendations from those that you know or other internet users, you are advised to make your own decision.  Whether or not a social networking website comes highly recommended, you are still encouraged to check it out first.  A large number of social networking websites are free to use; therefore, there are no risks associated with giving the site a try. Despite the fact that most online social networking sites are free to use, there are some that you must pay for.  A large number of these websites offer free trials.  Even if the trial period is only for a few days, you should easily be able to get a feel of the site’s environment and determine whether or not it is right for you.

In your search for a social networking website, whether you perform your own internet search or rely on recommendations from others, you should be able to find a number of popular websites. Those websites may include, but should not be limited to, Yahoo! 360, MySpace, Classmates, and Orkut. The good news about this is that if you are not satisfied with the social networking website you joined, you don’t have to worry; there are many more available for you to choose from.
