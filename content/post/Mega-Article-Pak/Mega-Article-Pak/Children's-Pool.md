Children's Pool

Also known as the Casa, the Children's Pool is a 
small beach partially protected by a sea wall.  
The original intention here was to create a fully
protected swimming area, although sand has now
filled in much of the area that exists to the
inside of the wall.

This is a very beautiful beach, offering several
panoramic views.  Almost all year long, seals and
sea lions are present on or near the beach, with
a reserve for these marine mammals, known as Seal
Rock being just a bit offshore.

The Children's Pool is within a short walking 
distance of the commercial area of the community
of La Jolla.  You can find grassy park areas a
short distance to the north and south.  Several
small beaches are nearby as well, including 
Wipeout Beach to the south and Shell Beach to the
north.

Children's Pool is also a popular beach for 
scuba divers because of the reefs just offshore.
These very same reefs can help create very strong
currents and other hazards, especially in high
surf conditions.

Lifeguard protection
Lifeguards are staffed daily throughout the year.
In the summer, lifeguard hours are normally 9 AM
until dark.  During other times of the year, 
lifeguards may not begin duty until 10 AM.

Directions
From the north, take I-5 to La Jolla Village 
Drive, westbound.  At the signalized intersection,
turn left onto Torrey Pines Road.  Follow this 
road to Prospect Street and turn right.  Be on
the lookout for signs and bear right onto Coast
Boulevard.

From the south, take I-5 north to La Jolla
Parkway.  Continue following it as it will become
Torrey Pines Road.  Follow this road to Prospect
Street and take a right.  Watch for the signs then
take a right on Coast Boulevard.

Parking
At La Jolla Cove, there is a very limited amount
of on street parking.  Onstreet parking can be
very hard to find, especially in the summer.  It's
limited to three hours at a time on weekdays,
although there is no limit on weekends.

You should always check the signs for any types
of parking restrictions.  Paid parking is also
available in downtown La Jolla at several locations
and it's also a short walk from the beach.

For a great day of fun, scuba diving, or just 
enjoying the water, the Children's Pool in La
Jolla is a great place to go.  You should always
try to get here early, as it can get very crowded
in the summer.  Once you get here, you'll find
yourself completely amazed with what the Pool will
offer you and your family.
