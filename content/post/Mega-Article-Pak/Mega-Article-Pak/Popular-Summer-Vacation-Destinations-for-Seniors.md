Popular Summer Vacation Destinations for Seniors 
Senior travel is growing in popularity.  Instead of relaxing at home, a large number of senior citizens are making the decision to get out and travel.  If you are a senior citizen and you are interested in taking a summer vacation, you may be wondering which summer vacation destination is best.
