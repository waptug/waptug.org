Dry Eyes And Contacts

If you have dry eyes, contact lenses may be a nightmare.  With healthy eyes, a very thin layer of tears will always form under the contact lens.  When this layer starts to dry out however, the lens will begin to feel dry.  Dry eyes from contact can be very irritating, uncomfortable, and lead you to try to squinch or rub your eyes to seek relief.

Even though contact lenses are indeed a cause of dry others, there are other causes as well, one of which being your natural ability to produce years.  Some people will produce less tears than others, which can indeed be a problem when wearing contact lenses.  As you get older, the tears that you are able to produce will begin to decrease.

The environment is another cause.  If you work in a factory or area that is over heated, or exposed to dust or smoke, your eyes will start to dry out.  The more your eyes are exposed to these types of situations, the more dry they will become.  After a few hours, you may find yourself having to remove your contacts due to the dryness becoming so irritating.

There are however, some types of contact lenses that can contribute to dryness as well.  A majority of contact lenses are made of water and polymers, most being more than 50% water.  Even though the contact is moist and may feel comfortable in your eye, the water will start to evaporate from the contact lens as you wear it.  When this happens, the contact will draw moisture from the tears in your eyes, which results in dryness.  If the contact lens contains a lot of water, then it is almost guaranteed to lose moisture throughout the day.

With dryness being a common problem for most people who wear contact lenses, manufacturers are always working to create contacts that will remain comfortable throughout the day.  Dry eyes are the most common reason for irritation, and the main reason as to why people decide to give up contacts and just go with glasses to correct their vision.

Out of all the different contacts on the market, Acuvue Oasys are among the most popular.  Although they are relatively new, they are specifically made for those who work or live in dry environments.  These contacts contain a special agent for re-wetting purposes, which enables the contact lens to remain moist, even if your eyes aren’t producing enough tears.  They are daily wear contacts, and should be soaked in solution at night and replaced every two weeks or so.

Even though there are other contact lenses out there that are great for dry eyes, Acuvue are considered to be the best brand.  No matter which type of contact lens you wear, you should always take care of them.  You should always clean them once removed, and soak them in solution at night.  This way, you’ll remove the protein build up and ensure that you are putting clean contact lenses back into your eyes.

Even though dry eyes are very common, you can always help to rectify the situation by using right pair of contacts.  You can also get re-wetting or saline drops as well, to put in your eyes when they start to feel dry.  These drops are the preferred way of dealing with dry and irritable eyes, as they help to produce enough moisture for comfort.  You can buy re-wetting or saline drops at most department stores - and they cost a little of nothing.
