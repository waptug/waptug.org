Guard Dogs And Home Security

These days, home security is simply a must have.  Burglaries and crime are always on the rise, which makes it all the more important to protect your home.  There are various burglary alarms and home surveillance systems available, designed to help you protect your home.  Although they are good in their own rights, nothing compares to an old fashioned guard dog.  Guard dogs have been used for generations – to help people protect their homes and their belongings.

For many years, guard dogs have helped to scare off burglars and thieves.  Although most have gotten used to dogs now days, nothing fends off a thief more than a vicious dog grabbing his ankle and clamping down.  Almost all guard dogs have serious bites and can seriously injure a burglar.  Guard dogs are trained to protect one’s home – and they will do so no matter what.

When you get a guard dog, you should always make sure that you let him know who is safe to be around your home.  You don’t want the dog to be vicious towards everyone, as friends and family are certainly allowed to be around your home.  Most guard dogs are left outside of the home, with some deciding to keep them indoors.  Indoor dogs are great, as they will instantly catch a burglar the second he decides to break into your home.

If you plan to keep your guard dog indoors, you should always have a supply of food and water available, as he will be there when you aren’t.  You will also need to give him access to an outdoor area as well, so he can use the bathroom.  A fenced in yard is an ideal place for a guard dog to go outside, as he can come and go as he pleases.  Sometimes, a burglar will try and sneak around the back entrance – which is where giving a guard dog outside access can really come in handy.

Before buying the dog, you should always carefully research the species and where you plan to get your dog from.  Police dogs or dogs that have been trained for protection are ideal, as they already know how to defend things.  Dobermans and Pit Bulls are great for protection as well, simply because they are well known for being very vicious.  

If you carefully research your options and get your guard dog from a reliable source, you shouldn’t have much of anything to worry about. You should never get your dog from a lesser known or poor source, as the dog may be poorly trained or not in good health.  A guard dog can be a great addition to any home – providing you get a dog in good health and more than capable to fend of burglars.
