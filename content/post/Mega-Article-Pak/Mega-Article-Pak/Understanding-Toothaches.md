Understanding Toothaches

As we all know, toothaches are the result of several different factors.  The pain that stems from a toothache is always apparent, normally in the form of throbbing.  The pain will normally intensify as time goes by, when you eat, lay down, or drink hot/cold liquids.  Toothaches are very painful, and it may seem that no matter what you do - it seems to hurt more.

In the dental world, toothaches can include such things as cavities, infections or abscess in the teeth or gums, debris that has been trapped between the teeth and gums, and trauma to the face, teeth, or the jaw.  Sometimes, toothaches can result from medical conditions and have nothing to do with dental.  In most cases, if the problem goes without being checked, it can lead to serious trouble and maybe even become a life threatening situation.

Normally, when you have a toothache, you’ll experience tremendous pain.  The pain will stem from the affected tooth or the jaw, and you’ll know it almost immediately.  It will start out to be a throbbing pain, then continue to get worse and worse until you get it treated.  If you wait too long and allow the infection to spread throughout the tooth, you’ll end up having to get it pulled or cut out.

Anytime you start to experience a toothache, you shouldn’t hesitate to make an appointment with your dentist to have it checked.  Sometimes, getting an appointment when your tooth starts hurting is easier said than done.  Even though you may be able to use certain products to stop the pain, the pain will always come back until you get the problem fixed.  A toothache will always come back, until you get the tooth taken care of.

If you visit your dentist in time and he catches the problem early, he may be able to save your tooth.  Normally, this will result in a filling, crown, or root canal, although you won’t have to have the tooth removed.  Dentists always look to save teeth, as they don’t like to remove a tooth unless they absolutely have to.  If the tooth has become abscessed, the dentist will put you on antibiotics such as penicillin until the infection has subsided enough to remove the tooth.

Throughout our lives, most of us will experience the pain and agony of a toothache at some point.  A toothache can be the worst pain you have ever felt in your life, especially if you are feeling the pain of an abscess.  If you’ve never had a toothache, you should consider yourself lucky.  Those who have had toothaches though, will tell you that the pain is something you never want to experience - it will make you feel as if your whole world is falling apart.
