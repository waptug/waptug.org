Christmas Shopping for Grab Bags

Although the Christmas season is all about giving, many people often find themselves completely stressed out about the prospect of Christmas shopping. For these individuals, one of the most stressful shopping situations involves Christmas shopping for gifts to contribute to grab bags. Sure it may be easy to purchase a great gift for your sister or your best friend but purchasing a gift for a complete stranger is considerably more difficult. Consider an office Christmas grab bag where each participant is asked to bring in a gift of an approximate dollar value. Each participant then takes turns choosing a gift from the grab bag. This can be a difficult situation because the participants likely have a variety of different interests and you may not even know all of the participants. However, there are a few strategies for making selecting a Christmas gift for this occasion fairly simple.

One of the easiest ways to ease the stress of this Christmas shopping dilemma is to purchase a Christmas gift you would be happy to receive. This is not as simple as it sounds because you also have to ensure the gift you choose is something which will appeal to others. You may have a specific interest such as knitting and may be thrilled with the prospect of receiving knitting needles but it is not reasonable to expect that everyone else would be happy with this Christmas gift. When Christmas shopping for a grab bag, it is important to choose items you like but that are also practical and universally liked. This will help to ensure the item you select will be enjoyed and cherished by the grab bag participant who selects the item you purchased. Useful household gadgets are often very good ideas for this type of situation.

Another way to deal with the stress of Christmas shopping for grab bag presents is to carefully consider the participants who will be selecting a Christmas gift from the grab bag. If you know most of the other people, you probably also have a good idea about the types of gifts they will like. For example, if you work in an office where most of the employees are Green Bay Packer fans, it might be a good idea to purchase an item such as a Green Bay Packers sweatshirt. Although the entire office may not be Packers fans you are putting the odds in your favor by selecting a gift which will appeal to the majority of the participants who are selecting a Christmas gift from the grab bag. Even if the person who selects the item does not enjoy the gift, they may be able to trade with another participant who will be very excited to receive the gift in question. 

Finally when Christmas shopping for a grab bag gift, you should consider purchasing a gift card or gift certificate as a gift. This gift will likely appeal to all of the participants in the Christmas gift grab bag and will help to ensure the lucky participant who selects your gift will be able to use the gift card to purchase something they really want or need.

Still others who are Christmas shopping for a grab bag gift might consider purchasing a joke gift and including a gift receipt along with the item so the participant can exchange the item for something they would prefer. For example you might want to purchase a CD or DVD to contribute to the grab bag but selecting a CD or DVD which will be appreciated by all the participants and which the participants do not already own can be difficult. However, it might be fun to purchase a CD from an artist most people would be embarrassed to own or a DVD for a cheesy movie and include the gift receipt so the recipient can return the embarrassing CD or DVD for a CD or DVD they really like. All of the participants will get a laugh out of seeing the embarrassing gift and the participant gets to return the gift so everyone wins in this situation.
