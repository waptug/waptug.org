Parasites and the pH miracle diet

The pH miracle diet restores balance to body. By eating mostly alkaline foods, you give your body nutrition that is more in line with the alkaline state of your cells. Excess acidic foods can lead to a host of problems. Among other benefits, following the pH miracle diet can also reduce your tendency to harbor dangerous parasites in your system that can wreak havoc on your health.

What do pH and parasites have to do with one another? The human body has a normal pH at the intracellular level of around 7.4. This is slightly alkaline. Parasites, which are unfriendly bacteria, viruses, protozoa, amoebas and microscopic worms, cannot live between a pH of 7.2 to 7.4. 

In the United States, we have a diet that produces high levels of acid at the intracellular level. This is called acidosis, and it is a major underlying cause to many diseases. It also allows parasites to run rampant through your body. If you want to maintain health, you’ll need to restore balance to your body with an alkalizing diet.

Over time, everything we consume either keeps our bodies in an acidic state or a base state (alkaline). Processed sugars and starches, which are both a major mainstay of the Western diet, are some of the prime offenders in the acidification process. Natural sugar sources have minerals and vitamins within them. Fruits start out as acids, but have the necessary minerals within them to help the cells turn those acids into alkaline by products. Processed sugars do not, and when they are consumed, they release acid into the body. With heavy use of starches and sugars, the body becomes acidic.

Acidic pH at the intracellular level becomes a breeding ground for parasites and actually causes a mutation of friendly intestinal flora into a condition called candidiasis. Candida is natural yeast that is found in the intestine. It is kept in balance by other friendly bacteria that live with it. 

However, with the overuse of sugar and the introduction of antibiotics, these friendly bacteria will becomes less prevalent. Candida will mutate and grow out of control. Candida symptoms include uncontrollable sugar cravings, chronic yeast infections, acne, dry skin, fatigue and frequent sinus infections. Parasites can also thrive when candida does, because the friendly bacteria are not there to keep them in check. Worms that would normally pass through the body find a hospitable environment and take hold in the intestine. 

Parasites can destroy cells faster than they can be regenerated. They also produce toxic substances as a byproduct of their digestions. These toxic substances can lead to allergic reactions and can cause you to develop new food allergies. Parasites also irritate and invade body tissues, including the intestinal lining and even the skin. The parasites make it difficult for the tissues to operate correctly. 

Over time, organ obstructions can develop and this can put pressure of your body organs and overall body functions. The immune system becomes depressed and the presence of parasites can prevent your body from using its natural healing reactions. Finally, the over presence of parasites in the body can prevent your body from absorbing nutrients properly.

The good news is that by following the pH diet you can restore the balance to your body. Since parasites can’t live in an environment that is between 7.2 and 7.4 pH, alkalizing your diet will help remove them from your system. When you follow this diet you will be able to reverse the acidification process and make your body an inhospitable place for parasites.
