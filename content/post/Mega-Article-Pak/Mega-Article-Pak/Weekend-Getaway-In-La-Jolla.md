Weekend Getaway In La Jolla

Translated, La Jolla means "the jewel", which is an
apt name for a splendid and beautiful town full of
blue water.  One of California's best oceanside 
towns, La Jolla is also home to many of the best
beaches in the state.

When you visit, you'll notice that there are many
things to do.  If your looking for something to do,
here are 5 great things to occupy your time:
	1.  Beaches - When you hear that San Diego
has great beaches, it's the truth.  La Jolla Cave,
La Jolla Shores, and Windansea are the best in
San Diego, and possibly even the state.
	2.  Birch Aquarium - Although it's a small
aquarium, it's packed with a lot of interesting
stuff and best of all - it won't wear you out.
	3.  La Jolla Playhouse - This theater 
company is highly known around the world.
	4.  Walking tour - Hike Bike Kayak will
offer you a splendid one hour tour that focuses
on the beauty and splendor of the La Jolla Coast
and the history of the city.  
	5.  Kayaking - The Hike Bike Kayak company
also offers a tour of the La Jolla sea caves, 
with no experience required.

A weekend trip to La Jolla is an excellent time
to enjoy a leisurely brunch.  The Cottage serves
great cruisine in a beach bungalow atmosphere, 
while the Marine Room at the Sea Lodge was voted
the best Sunday brunch in the area several times
in a row.  If your looking for a simple 
breakfast, with great views and few tourists, 
follow Coast Blvd. to the Goldfish Point Cafe.

For a getaway for the weekend, La Jolla is a hard
place to beat.  There's plenty to do here, with
the beaches in the summer.  If you visit on hot
days, you'll spend a majority of your time on
the beaches - and loving every minute of it.
