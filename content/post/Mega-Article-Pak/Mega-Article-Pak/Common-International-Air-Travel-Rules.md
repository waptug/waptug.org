Common International Air Travel Rules

Everyday, in the United States, a large number of individuals, couples, and families travel by way of an airplane.  Out of all of those travelers, a decent number of them are traveling overseas or to a foreign country. As international travel continues to increase in popularity, it is likely that the numbers will continue to rise. In fact, there is even a good chance that you may make the decision to travel to another country. If so, it is advised that you famialrize yourself with the international air travel rules.  

When it comes to international air travel rules, there are many travelers who automatically get confused.   This is because not many people know that the rules for international air travel are different than the rules for domestic air travel. In reality, they aren’t exactly the same, but they aren’t that much different either.  Despite the similarities, it is still advised that you place a focus on international air travel, especially since you will be traveling internationally.  

As previously mentioned, you will find that a number of the air travel rules are similar between domestic and international travel.  One of those rules is the airport screening process.  In all airports, even if they are not classified as an international airport, passengers will need to pass through the appropriate airport security checkpoints. This screening process includes the close examination of your checked baggage.  Unlike in the past, now almost all airlines thoroughly inspect checked baggage looking for explosive, flammable, or illegal items.

Since a large number of international airports not only offer international flights, but domestic flights as well, intentional passengers are not always separated from domestic ones. Essentially, this means that the passenger screening procedures, as well as the screening for all luggage will be the same.  All flyers are advised to remove any of their accessories, which may set of the metal detectors, as well as their shoes. Your shoes will be sent through the x-ray machine. This is done to ensure that there are not explosives or other dangerous materials hidden in them. 

One of the few differences that you will see, between domestic air travel and international air travel, has to do with the first check-in.  When you first arrive at the airport, you will need to approach the airline counter to register yourself.  This is also where your checked luggage will be examined and processed for the trip.  On domestic flights, passengers only need to supply a picture id. This identification is usually a government issued identification card or a driver’s license.  If you are planning on traveling internationally, you will need to supply additional proof of identification.

The proofs of identification that you will need will all depend on the airport in which you are leaving from and the airport that you will be arriving at.  If you are required to show more than a picture id, you may need to bring your birth certificate, your passport, your visa, or your certificate of citizenship.  Although your first impulse may be to bring them all, just incase, you will want to refrain from doing so. Unless absolutely necessarily, you will want to keep these important personal documents safe at home.

The above mentioned international air travel rules and procedures are just a few of the many that you may be required to follow.  If and when you are unsure about a particular rule, it is advised that you seek professional assistance. That assistance should either come directly from an international airport or an international airline.
