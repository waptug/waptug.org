Skiing in Austria

The world famous home of skiing, Austria, is an ideal resort for anyone who enjoys skiing.  The fresh alpine slopes, combined with picture-postcard scenery, and a grand culture of centuries old make Austria an ideal holiday destination, whether or not you simply adore skiing like me!

Austria is home to a wide variety of ski resorts, catering for all abilities and tastes.  From the lavishly expensive to the bargain basement (yet still of a consistently high quality), Austria has it all, from the highest peaks, to the snowiest landscapes, and with a bit of research you can find some really great deals.

When in Austria, you’d be mad not to ski the alps.  The dream of many skiers, the alps span several European countries, and is a must-ski for an enthusiast.  Spend a good few days in Austria, and dedicate at least one of them to skiing the alps.  You won’t regret it, I can promise you that!

If you put in the research work before you leave, you will generally be able to find some top quality accommodation at low prices.  Whether you are booking within a ski resort, or nearby, you should consult the internet to find last minute deals which might help you save money.  A good tip to bear in mind is that the star rating given  to accommodation does not indicate quality.  You might be better off in a one star than a three star for example, given that the star only represents the level of facilities.  Additionally, lower star ratings are usually cheaper, so you can benefit from quality, reduced price accommodation if you know where to look. Whatever type of accommodation you opt for, if you are flexible enough to leave for your vacation instantly you will benefit from good deals.  Hotels often cut their prices at the last minute, on the basis that some money for a room is better than no money, and so if you’re prepared to get away as soon as possible, you will find it can be really cheap, and you can still have a great time all the same.

On top of that, the internet is home to a variety of low cost airlines which run ‘no frills’, no ticket services.  In my personal experience, I have found these airlines to be as good as their more expensive competitors, and just as efficient and comfortable.  One word of caution about any airline: make sure they are equipped to handle skiing equipment.  Some companies will charge a surplus for your skis, so it is important to ask before you book as to arrangements for bulky or large and fragile goods.

Another highly recommended purchase is insurance for both your equipment and yourself.  Things do go wrong, on holiday as well as at home.  It is important, therefore to make sure you are covered.  Particularly when you are placing your equipment in an airplane hold, or when you are indulging in a dangerous sport like skiing, insurance is important for ensuring you don’t end up high and dry.  You can find good deals if you shop around, and it really is worth the few bucks to get that piece of mind, and actual backup in case things go wrong. In a word, it is essential. Don’t leave home without it!
