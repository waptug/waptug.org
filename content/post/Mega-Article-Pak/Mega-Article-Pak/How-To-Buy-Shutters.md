How To Buy Shutters

Currently, shutters are made in a number of different
materials, with wooden shutters still being the 
benchmark for quality window coverings.  Quality
wood shutters are designed to last for the lifetime
of your home.  Deciding on the material for your
shutters is the first step in making things work.

Selecting your shutter style
There are two basic styles of shutters available.
The traditional style uses a narrow shutter panel
with 1-1/4" louvers.  Traditional shutter louvers
are normally wedge shaped, being thicker in the
front and narrower in the rear.  Plantation type
shutters are generally 1-18" thick with larger
louvers.  

Selecting the shutter finish
Shutters can be stained, painted, or both.  Almost
all companies offer a number of paints with stain
colors, while some don't.  Paint colors will 
generally include a variety of whites and lights.
The stains will help enhance wood grains in a
number of tints and tones, starting from light
natural tones to an almost black pitch.  Keep in
mind, both synthetic and wood composite shutters
can't be stained.

Determine the price
Because of their material options, shutters will
come in a wide range of prices, with many suppliers
calculating the price on the square foot.  Prices
are calculated based on the exact window size,
shutter, style, finish, and number of panels 
involved.

Deciding on the unit
Shutter units can use a number of different panel
configurations within a window.  The number of
panels across the shutter is determined by the
shutter style, traditional or plantation, and
the width of the window.  The traditional style
panels are normally narrower than the plantation
style and would use more panels across the window.

Each specific company offers guidelines for the
number of panels to be used with a window.  If
the window is tall enough, you may want to 
consider a double tier, or two tier shutter
unit that uses one set of shutters at the top
and one set at the bottom.

Each set of shutters will then open independently
on the other.  You can also use a divider rail,
which is is a horizontal bar that creates a top
and bottom louver section within a single style 
of panel.

Measure and order
Carefully follow the measuring instructions,
then determine the window type and installation
provided by the company you have selected.  The
directions should be detailed, yet very easy for
you to follow.  

The company should also offer phone assistance 
should you have any questions.
