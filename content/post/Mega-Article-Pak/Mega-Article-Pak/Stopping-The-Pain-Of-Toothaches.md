With these types of toothache relief products, you simply rub the ointment on the affected area and it will kill the pain. These products work quickly, although they may not be able to help if the infection has spread or has gotten so bad that the tooth is literally dying.

Another way to stop the pain is to use Tylenol or aspirin.  If you are going this route, you should use tablets that dissolve.  Simply take the tablet and put it in your mouth, then use your tongue to hold it against your tooth.  The aspirin or Tylenol will start to dissolve, and work it’s way into your nerve and stop the pain.  This is a very effective way to stop the pain, although once the pill dissolves it can leave a terrible taste in your mouth.

Keep in mind that if the problem is an infection, you’ll need to use antibiotics until the infection is gone.  Once the infection is gone, the dentist will be able to proceed with treatment.  Most toothaches are the result of a cavity, which will need to be filled.  Anytime you start to experience a toothache you should get it treated.
