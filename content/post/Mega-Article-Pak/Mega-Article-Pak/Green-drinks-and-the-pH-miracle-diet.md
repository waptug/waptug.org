Green drinks and the pH miracle diet 

If you’ve been learning about the benefits of the pH miracle diet you’ve probably run across the phrase “green drinks” before. In fact, a quick search of reviews on Robert Young’s book “The pH Miracle Diet” shows that many people who use the program also use green drinks to boost the level of alkaline in their diets. What are green drinks and how are they beneficial to those following the pH diet?

Green drinks are a simple and easy way for people to get more nutrition and alkalinity into their diet. The pH miracle diet approach offers people a simple and basic understanding of why their bodies are out of balance. The key problem in health and excess weight is the presence of too much acid in the diet. That acid builds up and causes problems in the functioning of your cells. Over time, the acidity builds up in your body and makes a negative environment for your cells, organs and tissues. The solution is to eat an alkalizing diet that has a calming effect on the system. This will get your body pH back into balance and allow your cells to function as they were meant to.

You can simply and easily infuse your body with alkaline foods by using green drinks one to three times per day. Green drinks are made from grasses, sprouted grains and other green vegetables. These will help your body become more alkaline and they have the vitamins, minerals and amino acids that your body needs to repair itself.

There are many different green drinks available on the market. Most come in powder form and each day you mix a few spoonfuls with water.

Kamut grass can decrease cholesterol levels, help with weight loss and add protein to the diet. Broccoli is a strong anti-cancer food and it also helps boost the immune system and improve digestion.

Alfalfa sprouts can help redistribute your body weight after you lose weight. These are just a few of the powerful ingredients contained in green drinks. Some have lists of dozens of ingredients.

Another thing to look for in your green drink is notification that the ingredients are organically grown. Make sure the green drink contains no algae, mushroom or probiotics as these are acidifying ingredients. Finally, check the label carefully for non-nutrient ingredients and fillers.

The directions for taking green drinks depend on the manufacturer. Most green drinks are taken mixed with water up to four times daily. Some are available in capsules and should be taken with plenty of water. When you first begin taking green drinks, it is recommended that you take half a dose for one week in order to get your body used to the effects.
