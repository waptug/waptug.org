Why Do Small Dogs Help with Hypoallergenic Conditions?

There are several reasons why small dogs are hypoallergenic. Since they are small, many breeds cannot climb on the couch, bed, or other furniture. With fewer allergens on the furniture, you will not be as affected by them. Small dogs want to have their own space. They will sleep in a dog bed or blanket that you should wash often. Keeping small dogs in a crate during the day while you are gone will make them feel safer and also prevent them from destroying your home. This will also reduce allergens from getting into the carpets and on the walls. 

Small dogs usually have shorter hair or they have hair that is long and thin. This hair does not seem to cause as many problems to those with dog allergies. Their hair is easy to take care of and does not shed as often as other breeds. While you will have to take these dogs to be groomed more often, you should be able to breathe easily around them. Since the dogs do not shed as often, less dander is present in carpeting and on walls as well. 
Most small dog breeds do not produce a lot of saliva. Saliva can also cause people to have allergy attacks. This is because of bacteria that are found in the saliva.  

When you are looking for a small dog, you should find a breed that fits your lifestyle. This will allow you to build a trusting relationship that will last a long time. Small dogs enjoy being with their owners and do not like being apart. As long as the dog is in the same room with you, it will be fine. If you do not feel you can build this trust, then you should find another breed of hypoallergenic dog. Not all breeds are small. There are a few medium breeds that do not need as much one on one time. 

While all dogs need to get their exercise, small dogs do not need as much. Small dogs cannot go for long walks, but they can go for short ones in places that they know and feel comfortable in. Trips to the park or walking around the neighborhood are good exercise for the dog. Small dogs are very playful and enjoy playing games at home. Since some breeds do not have undercoats, they will need small sweaters when the weather gets cold. You should not leave small breeds outside in the cold for too long as their coats will not protect them. 

If you live in a small apartment or home, a small dog will be better for you. Some breeds do not bark too much and since they don’t require much exercise, living in an apartment will not inhibit them in any way. Small dogs are wonderful companions for those who suffer from allergies or those who don’t. You should research the breeds you are interested in before buying one so that you will know how to train, discipline, and show your new dog affection.
