Minimizing The Pain Of Tattoos

No matter what you may hear, there really is no way to predict the amount of pain that you’ll experience when getting a tattoo.  If you arrive with determination and the right frame of mind, it may not hurt you as much as you thought.  On the other hand, if you arrive at the studio scared half to death – it will more than likely hurt you more than you thought possible.

Tattoos involve piercing into skin, which almost always involves pain.  No matter how big or how small the tattoo may be or where it is located, you can expect to feel some pain.  The overall amount of pain you experience though, all depends on your tolerance.  If you have a high pain tolerance, you may feel next to nothing during the entire process.

When you get a tattoo, the needles will puncture your skin at very fast rates and variable depths.  The outline of the tattoo is easily the most painful, as the needles will be used to create a black line that will stand out on the tattoo.  This part need to be inserted fairly deeply and carefully to ensure that it’s done correctly.  The shading of the tattoo normally isn’t painful, although it depends on the penetration depth and effect that you desire.

Normally, the pain you feel is a slight burn or scratching feeling.  If the tattoo is going to be on an area where there is less bone and tissue such as the wrist or chest, the pain will be a bit more intense.  Areas like the arms and legs however, normally aren’t that painful.  Areas such as these have more tissue and muscle, which will lessen the amount of pain you feel.

Even though some pain is to be expected, there are ways that you can minimize the pain.  Below are some tips that will help you deal with the pain.
1.	Never show up to a get a tattoo on drugs or drunk.  This will thin out your blood, causing you to bleed more.
2.	Always choose a tattoo artist that you are comfortable around.  If you have confidence in your artist you can minimize the pain a great deal.
3.	Show up at the studio with sheer determination.  You should accept the fact that the tattoo will take time.  Quality work is an art – and should never be rushed.
4.	If the pain becomes too much to bear, you should let your tattoo artist know immediately.  He will allow you to take a break, or stop and come back later.  You can always break up your sessions, as tattoos don’t need to be finished immediately.
5.	To ease your mind, listen to music.  This way, you can take your mind to a different place and focus on something other than the tattoo.
