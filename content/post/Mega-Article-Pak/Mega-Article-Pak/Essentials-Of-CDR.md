Essentials Of CDR

The simple rule of thumb is that whatever you have
stored as a file on any other storage medium can
also be stored as a file on a CD-ROM.  To the 
recorder, a file is a file, and an ISO doesn't
care whether or not the file contains pictures, text,
or even audio sound.  

There are a few special cases, as to where you 
would want to record a file to a CD in a special 
type of format.  The most obvious here is CD-DA
audio.  If you wanted to record an audio file to
a CD so that you could play it back on your home
stereo, you would need to write a CD-DA (or Digital
Audio) disk.

When you copy data to a CD, you need to ensure that
your data doesn't exceed the capacity of the CD
that you will be recording to.  Due to the audio
requirements of CDs, the amount of information a
CD can hold is measured in minutes/seconds/sectors.
Each second can contain 75 sectors, each of which
are capable of holding 2,048 bytes of Mode 1 user
data.  

By using the CD Size command in the edit menu, you
can set the capacity of the set you wish to 
produce, which will help you to prevent exceeding
it.  The status bar will show you how much space
you have used, how much remains free, and the
percentage of each one.

Even though this may sound a bit confusing at 
first, keep in mind that it may take some time if
you are new to computers.  Even though copying a
CD is quite easy, knowing the limits and how things
work is a bit more complex.  Give it some time,
and you'll be copying files to CD like the pros
do it.
