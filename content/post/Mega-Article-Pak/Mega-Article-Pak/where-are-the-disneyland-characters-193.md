Where Are The Disneyland Characters?

A Disneyland vacation would not be complete 
without the Characters that we all know and love so 
well. Often, however, people leave Disneyland 
disappointed – simply because they never found 
their favorite character. The key to finding the 
characters you love is in knowing where to look for 
them in the first place.

Start with the Character Breakfast. Here, you will 
probably see Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow 
White, Mary Poppins, Jasmine, Ariel, Minnie and 
Mickey Mouse, and many others. If you miss your 
favorites at the breakfast, don’t despair – simply go 
find them! Many characters will be on hand, right 
inside the gates, to greet you as you arrive in the 
morning as well.

Start in Toon Town, where all of the Disney 
Characters live. Visit their homes to see if you can 
get a glimpse of them. Go early, while they may still 
be at home! Be sure to visit Goofy’s Kitchen as well, 
since many characters pop in and out throughout the 
day. If you’ve been through Toon Town, and you still 
haven’t seen your favorite character, your next stop 
should be Fantasyland. Different characters can be 
located telling stories throughout Fantasyland.
