Monogram Cake Toppers

Monogram Cake Toppers are becoming a popular way to adorn a wedding cake. One online site researched exclaims monogram cake toppers as all the rage. These cake toppers are usually very simple and elegant. The toppers are readily available at wedding decoration retailers and at a bevy of online retailers. 

Monogram Cake Toppers are available in endless designs. You can find everything from laser precision cut to glass. The monogram cake toppers are designed with one, two, or three letters. The three letter designed toppers feature the groom's first initial on the right, the brides on the left, and the couple's last name in the middle, oftentimes larger than the other two letters. Two letter designs are usually that of the first initials of both the bride and the groom. When choosing one letter, it is typically representative of the last name of the newlyweds. 

Metal monogram cake toppers are the most popular. Whether they are made of colored or classic white or yellow gold, they are a timeless and elegant way to remember your special day. The metal designs are precision cut for nice clean edges. These can be made in any color imaginable and are the sometimes embellished in Swarovski crystals.  These crystals are hand placed on the cut letters to create beautiful accents to the monogram cake toppers. 

Acrylic monogram cake toppers are also very nice. Done in the right way they give a ceramic look to the piece and are a little softer than the metal designs. These are usually done with just the basic acrylic material and do not feature the crystal embellishments.

Most manufacturers of monogram cake toppers offer a wide variety of styles and fonts. One online site visited offered over 1700 font choices and dozens of colors. The toppers are also available in a variety of sizes ranging from 2 inches to 8 inches. For the larger pieces an extra fee will be added to the monogram cake toppers. 

The prices for monogram cake toppers vary from the $25.00 single letter design to an elaborate $300.00 crystal laden masterpiece. It is not recommended to wait until the last minute as with most wedding items because the monogram cake toppers take up to seven weeks to deliver. Most sites do offer a rush order, for an additional fee. 

Not sure what to do after the wedding with your cake topper? Monogram cake toppers solve this problem for you.

This could be done very easily at home with a little creativity or brought to a local art store for a professional to do.
