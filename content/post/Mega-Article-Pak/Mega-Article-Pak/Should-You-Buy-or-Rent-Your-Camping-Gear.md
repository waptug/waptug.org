Should You Buy or Rent Your Camping Gear

Are you planning on taking a camping trip in the near future?  If this is your first time going camping, you will need to get camping gear to take with you, as you may not already own it.  While your first impulse may be to head on down to your local sports store, did you know that you have another option as well?  You do.  In addition to buying your own camping gear, you may also be able to rent it.

When it comes to determining whether you should buy your own camping gear or just rent the camping gear that you need, you may have a difficult time deciding what to do.  If you are wondering what you should do, you will want to continue reading on.  Below, the pros and cons of both buying your own camping gear and renting your camping gear are outlined.

As for buying your own camping gear, you will find that the biggest con or downside to doing so is the cost.  Depending on what you need to buy, it can get pretty expensive to purchase your own camping gear.  With that in mind though, there are a number of camping gear equipment pieces, like camping tents or sleeping bags, that can be purchased for affordable prices.  If you are looking to camp on a budget, you can still buy your own camping gear, but you just need to know where to look.

Although there are a number of downsides, like the price, to buying your own camping gear, you will also find that there are a number of pros or plus sides to doing so as well. One of those plus sides is the fact that you will own the camping gear in question. This means that you can use it as little or as often as you would like.  If you are planning to take a number of camping trips in the future, you will find that it is easier, as well as cheaper in the long run, to buy your own camping gear.

It is also important to mention the freedom that you have, when buying your own camping gear. When buying your own camping gear, you can buy basically whatever you want. For instance, if you would like a camping tent that is the color black, you are free to do so.  When you buy your own camping gear, you have the ability to be picky if you want to be.  With a large selection of camping gear pieces to choose from, from a number of different retailers, the decision as to what you want to buy is yours to make.

If you are unable to buy your own camping gear or if you would prefer not you, your other option is to rent your camping gear.  When it comes to renting camping gear, you will also find a number of pros and cons. As for the cons of renting your camping gear, you may find that you are faced with a limited selection of camping gear pieces to choose from.  Many camping gear rental stations only carry the basic items, like tents, hot plates, and coolers.  While you may have some choices, you will mostly find that your selection is limited.

As for the pros or plus sides to renting your camping gear, instead of buying it, you will find that the cost is much more affordable. Despite being relatively affordable, different camping gear rental stations charge different rental fees.  You will also find that camping gear can typically be rented for as little as one day or as long as a couple of weeks. Renting your camping gear is nice if this is your first time going camping and if you are unsure as to whether or not you would be interested in doing so again. 

As you can see, there are a number of pros and cons to both buying your own camping gear and renting it.  In addition to the two above mentioned options, you may also want to think about borrowing camping gear from someone that you know.  You may even be able to do so free of charge.
