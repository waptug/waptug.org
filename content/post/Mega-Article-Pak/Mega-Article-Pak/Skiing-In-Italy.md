Skiing In Italy

Italy has always been a consideration for those interested in experiencing the Alps for less.  Having said that, it is still considered one of the top European skiing countries today, and is a magnificent place to take a skiing vacation.  There is a certain romance about Italy that makes it the number one choice for so many skiers each year, and it is easy to see the attraction with the place.  From its northern snow-tipped peaks, you can also venture towards the cultural hotbeds of Rome and Turin, and experience Italy as it is intended, as well as its amazing ski slopes.

One of Italy’s smallest resorts, tucked up high, near Canazei in the North, is Alba.  Based on a tiny village, the Alba resort is the truest form of skiing escapism, with amazing off piste skiing to be had.  For the keen skier, this would make for an excellent day trip, or an excellent weekend away whilst staying at a bigger resort, and although it has only 5 lifts, it is a real Italian treasure, and something not to be missed if you like peaceful surroundings whilst you ski.  On top of that, if you enjoy cross country skiing, Alba also offers a number of extensive trails for you to pursue, ensuring that you are likely to have a great time, whatever you skiing preferences and ability.  

If you’re looking for something bigger, why not consider Italy’s highest resort, Passo Tonale.  An ideal family resort, Passo Tonale is focussed more around beginners and intermediates, and provides a friendly atmosphere that is just simply lacking from some of the bigger resorts.  Passo Tonale is also home to a top class ski school, employing some of the region’s most talented skiing instructors.  In addition to that, the staff pride themselves on the conditions of their slopes, which are groomed frequently.  From the peak of Passo Tonale, you are faced with a wonderful panoramic view of the whole region, which is truly breathtaking, and it has been known for skiers to spend hours simply analysing the view.  Passo Tonale is a great resort if you are looking for a busier, more down to earth ski resort for you and your family.

Selva Gardena is one of Italy’s largest resorts, and if you are looking for some great scenery and excellent, consistent snow coverage, you could do a great deal worse than here.  A great value for money resort, Selva Gardena is also child friendly, making it another fantastic resort to take the family.

Italy has a diverse range of ski resorts to cater for all different tastes and abilities.  In general you will find all the resorts welcoming and friendly, not to mention the amazing hospitality you will experience in some of their restaurants and bars.  If you are looking for a good value for money trip, and you enjoy skiing, the North of Italy is ideal for you, and can provide any skier with an adequate challenge of their abilities.  Additionally, with some of the best skiing instructors in the world, Italy is one of the best places in Europe to enjoy skiing without paying an absolute fortune.  Italy truly is a great skiing location for anyone looking to experience the Alps in all their glory, amidst the wealth and depth of culture and history right around the corner.
