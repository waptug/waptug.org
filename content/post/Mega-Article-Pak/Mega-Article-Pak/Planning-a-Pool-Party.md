Planning a Pool Party: What You Need to Prepare For

Each year, a large number of Americans search for the perfect party idea.  If you have a pool in your backyard, you may already have what is needed for the perfect party, a pool. Pool parties are nice because they not only allow you to socialize with those that you know, but they also give everyone a way to cool off. If you are thinking about hosting a pool party, you will need to start planning. Despite what you may think there is actually a lot of planning involved in hosting a pool party.  

Perhaps, the first step in planning a pool party is to let everyone know that you are having one.  Although pool parties may not be like birthday parties or Christmas parties, you may still want to send invitations to your guests. These invitations, if you choose to send them, do not have to be elaborate.  In fact, since your pool party will most likely be casual, your invitations should be as well.  If invitations are not your style, you will want to phone your friends or send them an email, inviting them to your pool party.

Once you have let your guests know that you are planning a pool party, you can then start preparing for the party. While it is not always important, you may want to consider confirming with guests whether or not they will be able to attend.  Having an accurate guest count may help you better prepare for your party. In fact, a guest count may enable you to determine how much food, drinks, or snacks you should have on hand.  

If you are planning on including a barbeque with your pool party, you will need to decide what type of food you would like to serve.  Like any other special occasion, you may want to have a wide variety of different foods. This will ensure that there will be at least one thing on the menu that each guest will enjoy. In addition to main courses, such as meat, you will also want to include side dishes. These side dishes commonly include fruits, vegetables, and salads.

After you have decided which foods you would like served at your barbeque, you will also need to think about making them. Even if your party isn’t for a few weeks, you may still want to develop a cooking schedule ahead of time. Although your main courses, such as barbequed meat, will be prepared the day of your pool party, you may want to prepare everything else earlier that day or the day before. This will help not only to ensure that you get all of the food prepared on time, but that you are also able to enjoy your own party.

As previously mentioned, you may want to include a barbeque with your pool party; however, it is not required.  If you are planning on having a pool party, without serving a large meal, you may still want to have snacks and drinks on hand.  Non-alcoholic drinks and most snack foods can be purchased for a reasonable price. Alcoholic drinks make for a great party, but some drinks can be expensive to purchase, especially in large quantities.

Aside from the food and entertainment, you may also want to make sure that you have a number of pool supplies and accessories on hand.  These items may include, but should not be limited to, beach balls, lifejackets, arm floaties, swim rings, floating chairs, and other popular swim toys.  If you do not already have a large collection of swim toys, you can easily purchase a few low-cost ones.  Many pool toys, such as swim rings, arm floaties, and beach balls, can be purchased for a reasonable price.  In fact, many of these items only cost around two or three dollars. It may also be a good idea to have extra towels on hand, just in case any of your guests forget to bring theirs.

Although pool parties are designed to be fun, you may want to establish some pool rules ahead of time.  These rules may help to keep your pool and your pool party guests safe, especially young children. Whether you plan a simple pool party or an elaborate one, it is likely that you will be happy with your decision to plan your party, ahead of time.
