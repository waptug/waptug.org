Reasons To Breast Feed

For many years, scientists have been playing out 
the ingredients that make breast milk the perfect 
food for babies.  They've discovered to day over
200 close compounds to fight infection, help the
immune system mature, aid in digestion, and support
brain growth - nature made properties that science
simply cannot copy.

The important long term benefits of breast feeding
include reduced risk of asthma, allergies, obesity,
and some forms of childhood cancer.  The more that 
scientists continue to learn, the better breast 
milk looks.  

In addition to making your baby healthier, breast
feeding may also make him smarter.  Many studies
have proved that breast fed babies tend to be
more smarter than babies who were fed with formula
or other methods.  Breast feeding does help with
nutrients and the support of brain growth, which
is something every mother should think about.

The benefits for the nursing mom are just as
good as they are for the baby.  The hormones that
are released during breast feeding will curb
blood loss post delivery and help to shrink the
uterus back to it's normal size.  

Long term, the breast feeding mom will have a
lower risk for premenopausal breast cancer,
which is the kind that strikes before the age
of 50.  The benefits will begin to show with 
three to six months of breast feeding and increase
the longer that breast feeding continues.

By now, you should realize that breast milk is
one power packed liquid.  It offers more for your
baby than formula, or any other scientific 
creation for that matter.  As you begin to plan
for the future of your baby, make a commitment
to breast feeding him for as long as you possibly
can - as it will do both your bodies good.
