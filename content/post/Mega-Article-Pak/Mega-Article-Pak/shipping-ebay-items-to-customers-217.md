Shipping eBay Items to Customers

If you stock the products that you sell on eBay, as 
opposed to drop shipping, you probably spend a 
great deal of time and money shipping items to your 
customers. If you are a big success on eBay, this 
could quickly become a problem. Organize your 
shipping practices before they get out of control!

Keep stamps, packing materials, and boxes on 
hand. You can have these items delivered to you, 
which will save you a lot of time. Use large padded 
envelopes instead of boxes whenever possible. These 
envelopes are easier to handle, and usually cheaper to 
purchase. Furthermore, they often weigh just a little 
less than cardboard boxes do, which will save a bit of 
money on the postage. Purchase stamps and packing 
materials online. Not only will you save time, you will 
save money as well. 

If you ship a lot of packages, purchasing your own 
set of postage scales will increase your efficiency – 
the expense will more than pay for itself. Other items 
you should invest in include a rubber stamp, label 
printing software, a good printer, and labels. Either 
use a stamp for the return label, or keep a large 
stock of pre-printed return labels. All you need is a 
plan and a little bit of organization to successfully 
ship your eBay items.
