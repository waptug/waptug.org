How to Help Dogs That Are Hypoallergenic

Dogs that are considered hypoallergenic may cause fewer allergic reactions in people who own them other breeds. There are many breeds of long hair, short hair, and hairless varieties to choose from depending on your particular allergies and what you are looking for in a dog. Hypoallergenic dogs are sold mostly by breeders, but you can also find them in pet stores and sometimes in animal shelters. If you decide to buy a hypoallergenic dog, there are ways to care for them that may require a little more work than non-hypoallergenic breeds. 

Caring for your hypoallergenic dog begins with caring for their coat. While many hypoallergenic breeds such as Terriers, Schnauzers, and Poodles have short hair, this hair can be coarse and will continue to grow unless the dogs are properly groomed. These dogs do not shed and have hair that can be compared to human hair. You will have to keep your dog groomed in order to prevent matting. Matting can cause skin rashes and other health problems if the dog’s coat is not taken care of. 

Brushing your dog is also important especially in breeds that have longer hair such as the Afghan Hound. While these dogs are considered hypoallergenic, their coats are long and shiny. They do not shed either, so brushing and grooming are important. Brush your dog at least twice a week to keep excess hair from building up. 

Some hypoallergenic dogs have undercoats, while others do not. Undercoats protect dogs from cold temperatures by storing body heat. Dogs that do not have an undercoat will not survive long in cold temperatures. Unless a breeder says you can keep your dog outside, you should keep the dog indoors. 

If you have a hairless dog, you will have to protect their skin with lotions and skin creams. You should not leave these dogs outside for long periods of time as they will suffer from sun burn and dehydration. 

Caring for your dog is not only making sure their coat and skin are protected, it also means making sure that they get enough exercise and time with you each day. Dogs that are left alone for long periods of time can become destructive. Training your dog by developing a routine will help them adjust to the times when you cannot be at home. 
If you will be out of town for more than two or three days, you should find a friend that can check in on your dog or you should consider boarding the dog until you come home. 

Protecting your hypoallergenic dog from cold temperatures, the sun, and from developing skin rashes are ways that you can help your dog live a long, healthy life. Because many breeds of hypoallergenic dogs are small in size, they are prone to arthritis, eyesight issues, tumors, and other problems. While you cannot predict how your dog will age, you should research different breeds to see what types of health issues they may have some day. Regular checkups with a vet will help your dog live a long life.
