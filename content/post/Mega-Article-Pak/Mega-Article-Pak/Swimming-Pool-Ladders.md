Swimming Pool Ladders

You can find a swimming pool ladder on almost all types of swimming pools.  Ladders are essential to swimming pools, as they are used to get in and out of the pool.  For both in ground and above ground pools, you can find a variety of different ladders to choose from.  The materials used for the ladders are available in either vinyl, aluminum, plastic, resin, or stainless steel.

The choices of color doesn’t vary too much, although you shouldn’t paint them.  To prevent slipping, some come with anti-skid materials.  Almost all pool ladders are easy to assemble if you follow the instructions, and come with a warranty as well.  You can find pool ladders on the Internet, or at your local department store or pool supply store.  

The ladders used with in ground swimming pools normally include 1 - 5 steps.  Depending on how deep the water is where you are using the ladder, the installation and number of steps will obviously vary.  When you select your ladder, you should make sure that the shape and height is compatible with your pool.  If your pool was formed with concrete, you may have had the ladder or steps formed during installation. If you have a fiberglass or liner pool on the other hand, you’ll need to properly secure the ladder at both the upper and lower ends.

Above ground swimming pools on the other hand, are a bit different.  Most people who have above ground pools have a deck that surrounds the pool, then a ladder than leads down into the water.  You can install your ladder off the deck, or simply position it solely on the pool.  It’s easier to install the ladder running off the deck and into the water, although you’ll need to properly secure it to the deck to ensure that it doesn’t slide off or end up hurting someone.

The ideal swimming pool ladder for an above ground pool should have 2 - 4 steps.  Most above ground pools are 4 - 6 feet in depth, although they can be a bit tough for kids to enter.  The more steps you have on your ladder, the easier it will be for kids to get in and out of the pool.  If you are using your ladder with a deck, you won’t need as many steps.

All things aside, a swimming pool ladder is essential for any swimming pool.  Without a ladder, it would be near impossible to get out of the pool.  If you have an in ground pool, adults and teenagers can get out from the side, although kids will need to use a ladder.  Ladders don’t cost a lot of money, yet they help to simplify getting in and out of your pool.
