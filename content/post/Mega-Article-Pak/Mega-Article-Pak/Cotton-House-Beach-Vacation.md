Cotton House Beach Vacation

The only hotel on the exotic island of Mustique, the
cotton house offers luxurious service, privacy, and
plenty of secluded beaches.  You can spend your 
days exploring the marine life, relaxing by the
pool, or getting pampered by the enticing spa.

The spa at the Cotton House offers an amazing array
of services, such as massages, facials, reflexology,
wraps, and fully body treatments.  You can catch a
spa in one of the four treatment rooms, just steps
from the beach, or even in the privacy of your
own room.

Situated between the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic
Ocean, the 1,400 acre Mustique Island offers a 
tennis club, nine secluded and beautiful beaches,
which are perfect for scuba diving, windsurfing,
and even snorkeling.

Rooms and suites
The Cotton House offers just 19 luxurious guest
rooms, cottages, and suites, most offering private
patios and panoramic views of the ocean.  The 
amentities offered by the Cotton House include soft
French cotton linens, a pillow menu, air, flat
screen televisions, and maid service twice a day.

If you are planning a honeymoon twist to your beach
vacation, you can splurge on one of the cottages 
with a private plunge pool, or even book the two
bedroom Cotton Hill Residence which offers a 
private swimming pool and its own staff that are
dedicated to you.

Eating
From dining in your cottage, ordering a picnic 
basket and going to an empty beach, or just having
a romantic candlelit dinner, Mustique leaves the
choices up to you.  A traditional afternoon tea 
is served each day in the Great Room, while there
are weekly cocktail parties held by the Cotton 
House as well.

Getting there
There are three ways that you can fly to Mustique.
You can go via Barbados, via Martinique, or via
Saint Vincent.  From Barbados, you can take a 
Grenadines Airways flight to Mustique for around 
$400 per person - round trip flight.
