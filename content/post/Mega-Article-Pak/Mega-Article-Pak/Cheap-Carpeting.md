Cheap Carpeting

When it comes to carpet for your home, you may want
carpet that you install yourself.  There are ways
that you can carpet a room very cheaply, without 
having to spend a lot of money.  Carpet can get very
expensive in a hurry, which is why saving money is
so very important to those on a tight budget.

One very cheap way you can carpet a room is by using
carpet samples.  This is actually considered new
carpet, as samples aren't considered to be used.

You can buy samples of carpet for .25 cents a piece
at closeout sales or at your local hardware or carpet
store.  Depending on the size of the room you are 
looking to carpet, how many samples you'll need 
will vary.  You'll also need staples as well, which
cost around a dollar or so.  Most of the time,
you can expect to pay a dollar or so for each square
of carpet, which is still considered to be cheap
carpet.

Keep in mind that using samples or square is a very
unusual style and you have to think about the resale
value of your home.  If you have a trailer or mobile
home, then the style is probably going to be unusual
and cheap to start with.  If you have an expensive
or mid priced home, then you may decide to use
cheap carpeting in the basement, playroom, or in
a children's playhouse.  

If you are doing a children's playroom, using 
multi-colored carpet is perfect.  It is very colorful
and if a spill stains one of the squares of carpet,
you can quickly and easily pull it back up and
install a new one.  This is a great advantage to
doing a playroom this way.

Installing your cheap carpet
The only things you'll actually need when you 
install carpet samples or squares in a room is a
carpet knife and a staple gun.  The 5/8" staples 
seem to work the best for squares and samples.

All you need to do is put the carpet peice in
place and staple in two or three staples along each
side.  Make sure you wiggle the head of the 
stapler down deep between the fibers, or between
the border and the fibers, so you can hide the 
staples as much as possible.

If you are carpeting a basement floor, you can
use carpet tape instead of staples.  With either
case, this is best to do when padding isn't that
important.  You can use padding as well if you
don't mind the complications, although without it,
its pure simplicity.

You may also choose to lay out your pieces of
carpet first, then decide where each individual piece
will go.  When you reach walls, heating sources, or
other obstacles, you can quickly and easily cut the
pieces to fit. If you happen to make a mistake, it
will cost you around a dollar, instead of costing
you a fortune.  When you make a mistake, all you
have to do is start over a new piece of carpet.

Before you begin to put the carpet down, you should
always estimate how many pieces you will need, 
and then call around to find a store that has
enough samples for the room.  

Although the samples will range in size at different
stores, the average is 18 X 18 inches.  If you 
use pieces that are the same size, you'll find 
things to be much easier.  Even though you may be
paying a dollar a piece, it rounds out to less
than .50 cents per square foot to carpet your room
of choice - which is really cheap carpet!
