Aspen Nightlife – How to Find the Entertainment

No matter what time of year it is when you visit 
Aspen, there is always something going on – 
even in the off season. The town is small, but 
there are usually several types of entertainment 
offered each evening in different parts of the 
small town. Generally, you won’t have to search 
too hard to find some entertainment – but it is 
better to know exactly what is going on all over 
town, so you can choose the Aspen nightlife 
that best suits your interests.

First, call the Chamber of Commerce in Aspen 
a few months before your trip if possible. Ask 
them what events are planned for the time 
period that you will be there. Events are usually 
scheduled well in advance, and finding out 
about these events well in advance will not only 
help you to better make your plans, but it will 
also allow you to purchase needed tickets in 
advance. Nothing will be more disappointing 
than arriving in Aspen and finding out that your 
favorite band is in town for a sold out show!

Events can come up at the last minute as well. 
Upon your arrival to your lodge or hotel, ask the 
concierge about events that will be taking place 
during your stay. If you have already contacted 
the Chamber of Commerce, you will know most 
of what is going on around town – but there may 
be a few surprises in store for you.

Don’t forget to check with the Chamber of 
Commerce offices in nearby towns and villages! 
Snowmass is a village that almost seems to 
be a part of Aspen – but it isn’t. Contact the 
Snowmass town hall to find out what events 
are scheduled in the village during your visit.

Have a plan before you arrive in Aspen. Use 
Internet resources, as well as the information 
that you learn from the various Chambers of 
Commerce and your lodge to plan your daytime 
and night time activities while you will be in 
Aspen. Again, there is always something to do 
in Aspen, and if you don’t plan ahead, you will 
waste a lot of time trying to decide what you 
want to do. 

While you want to go in with a plan, leave a 
day or two open – with no plans. Use these 
days for shopping expeditions or simply take a 
quiet walk through the quiet Victorian 
neighborhoods. Go to a restaurant that isn’t in 
your plans, or spend some time in the Great 
Room at your lodge. There is always 
something to do…but sometimes, it is nice to 
have nothing to do as well!
