Similar to those deals and discounts is the ability to obtain something online without paying a fee, those items, products, or services are commonly known as being free. Unfortunately, you will find that when it comes to being free, not all free things are actually free. One of those things is online video websites, not all of them are as free as you would think they would be.  

Before examining online video websites that are classified as being free, you first must understand that you may have to pay a small fee to view their online videos.  Most of the sites that are labeled free online video websites are free to join. Essentially, this means that you do not have to be considered a paid member just to join the site. By creating a free membership program, there are many online websites, including online video websites, that are able to claim that they operate and run a free program.

With most online video websites, you fill find a wide variety of free videos.  These types of videos have been found on almost all types of video websites. Free videos are, in most cases, considered homemade videos.  Homemade videos are made by internet users, just like you, who have little or no experience creating professional videos. Many of the free, homemade videos that you can find online include comedy skits, unprofessionally constructed music videos, how-to videos, and funny, but unscripted recordings.  

The video types that you may have to pay for include popular television show reruns, professional music videos, celebrity interviews, children’s television shows, and much more. Most online video websites, if they charge for these types of videos charge only around two dollars for each video, sometimes even less. Google Video is one of those websites.  Depending on the type of video website you are at, you can typically view this video more than once, after you pay for it.

While you may assume that it is a pain for pay for online videos, it is something that needs to be done. In fact, these small fees are, often times, the only legal way to watch your favorite television shows or music videos online.  This is because the content is owned by another individual, often a television producer or a record label. With these types of video, most video owners need to receive reimbursement for their work; thus the payment.  Unless permission is granted by the individual or company who owns the video rights, it technically illegal to have videos, whether they be music videos or television show reruns, available online free of charge.

In addition to legally viewing videos, you will also help to be generating income for someone else.  For instance, if you purchase the right to download or view a popular music video, it is likely that the artist or group you are watching will receive a small amount of compensation for their work. This compensation is often what keeps the television, movie, and music industry going in full swing.

As previously mentioned, you may find it inconvenient to have to go through the process of buying an online video, but it will be worth it in the long run, often in more ways than one.  You are encouraged to remember that the next time you go searching for an online video in an illegal matter.
