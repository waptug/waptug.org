Using the eBay Security and Resolution Center

Whether you are an eBay buyer or a seller, problems 
may arise at some point. That is why the eBay 
Security and Resolution Center was created. Even 
if you have never had a problem on eBay, and you 
don’t expect to, a visit to this eBay resource can be 
very enlightening, and it may even help you to 
protect yourself in all of your online activities.

If you do not receive an item that you bought from 
eBay, this is where it is reported. The same is true 
if you sold and shipped an item and did not receive 
payment for it. But there are many other ways to 
use the security center as well. You can learn how 
to protect yourself from identity theft, how to protect 
your eBay account and the eBay guidelines that 
are designed to make everyone’s buying and selling 
experience safe and enjoyable.

If you are an eBay seller, you will learn how to 
become a trusted seller, which will ultimately bring 
you more profits. There is something for everyone at 
the eBay Security and Resolution Center – even if 
you have never had a security problem at eBay.
