How To Clean Hard Contacts

Hard, or rigid contacts are comprised of material that is known as PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate).  This material is very rigid, and doesn’t contain near as much water as soft contacts.  With that in mind, taking care of and cleaning hard lenses is very different that cleaning and maintaining soft contact lenses.

Before you purchase a pair of hard or rigid contacts, you should know how to take care of them and how to clean them.  Hard contacts differ from soft contacts, as the cleaning process is very different.  When you purchase your contacts you should also purchase your cleaning solution.  Your cleaner is very important, as you must have it with hard contacts.

The one thing that hard and soft contact lenses have in common, is the fact that you must wash your hands before you handle either of them.  You should always wash your hands with soap and water before you handle your hard lenses.  Antibacterial soap is the best soap to use, as it will thoroughly clean your hands and it doesn’t contain any type of fragrance.

The first thing to do when cleaning your hard contacts is to take the lens out of your eye and put it in the center of your hand.  You should have your cleaner out, and ready to use anytime you are looking to clean your lenses.  Once you have the lens in the palm of your hand, squirt a couple of cleaning drops into the center of the lens.  Now, gently work the solution into the lens, for a minute or so.  You should always avoid using pressure, as you could end up tearing the lens.

Once you have finished cleaning your lens, you’ll need to rinse it.  You can rinse hard contact lenses using lukewarm water.  These types of lenses are very sturdy and don’t require any special liquid or solution for rinsing.  When you have finished cleaning and rinsing your contacts, simply put them back in the case and fill it with the solution that you have for soaking your hard lenses in.  The soaking solution will keep your contacts fresh, and clean the protein off of them that can build up from wear.

Hard contact lenses will last you for a long time, providing you take care of them.  Most contact lenses will last you longer than soft lenses, without needing to be replaced for months at a time.  They are easy to clean as well, providing you know how to clean them.  You can find the soaking and cleaning solution at your local department store, with several brands to choose from.  If you take care of your hard contact lenses and soak them in solution when you sleep, they will last you for a long time - with no problems or harm to your eyes.
