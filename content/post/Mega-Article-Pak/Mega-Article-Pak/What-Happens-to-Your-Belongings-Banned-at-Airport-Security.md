What Happens to Your Banned Belongings at Airport Security?

If you have recently taken a flight or plan to, chances are you have seen information on the air travel rules.  These rules include a wide variety of different topics, issues, and items; however, perhaps, one is more important than the rest. That air travel rule is the list of items that are prohibited from being taken on an airline, whether that ban only be for your carryon luggage or both your carryon luggage and checked baggage.  Unfortunately, there are some mistakes that are made.  If you, intentionally or not, forget to remove a prohibited item from your bags, do you know what will happen to you or to that item?

When it comes to prohibited items in airports, you will find that different consequences result.  These consequences tend to depend on the airport you are in, the airline you are flying with, as well as the item that you were trying to get through security checkpoints.  Essentially, if you were trying to sneak in a bottled water, the consequences would be far less than if you were trying to sneak in a gun, but there will still be consequences none the less.

The most common action taken, when it comes to trying to board an airplane with prohibited items, is that you will be pulled aside by airport security or other airport staff. All bags, including checked luggage, are usually checked with you nearby. This is done to help ensure that no prohibited items are found.  In the event that you are trying to store prohibited items, such as flammable objects, in your checked luggage, you will likely be asked to take the item to your car. In the event that you cannot, you may have to turn that item over to airport security.  The same can be said for prohibited items in your carryon luggage.

In most cases, you will be given an option as to what you want to do with your items. That is why it is advised that you arrive at the airport in advance.  Two hours early is often the recommended time. This will ensure that you are able to made additional accommodations, should you find that you are prohibited from taking some of your belongings aboard the airplane.  As previously mentioned, if you are unable to make accommodations for your belongings, you will have to turn them over to airport security.  If you are like most other travelers you may be curious as to what happens with those items.

The items confiscated by airport security and what happens to those items will all depend in the airport in question.  Each airport has their own way of dealing with confiscated items. It is not uncommon for these items to be taken, melted, and forever discarded; however, some airports are beginning to profit from the sale of prohibited items.  A number of airports have sold these items, ranging from tools to lighters to scissors, themselves or with the assistance of an auction seller.  Regardless of which action is taken, it is safe to say that you will no longer be able to recuperate your confiscated belongings.

Instead of just kissing your banned items goodbye, you will find that a number of airports have begun establishing onsite mail service centers.  These mail service centers are ideal for travelers who would be unable to make additional arrangements for their items, such as returning them to their vehicles.  With mail service centers, you will need to pay for the supplies, but you can easily have your items mailed to your home.  However, it is important to remember, that like all airports, the postal service also has a list of prohibited items. These items most commonly include flammable objects, such as lighters.

Although you have a number of different choices, when it comes to taking care of your items that are banned from going past airport security checkpoints, it is probably best if you just leave those items as home. Reviewing the list of banned items, before you start packing for your trip, is the best way to ensure that you are not left having to turn over some of your belongings to airport security.
