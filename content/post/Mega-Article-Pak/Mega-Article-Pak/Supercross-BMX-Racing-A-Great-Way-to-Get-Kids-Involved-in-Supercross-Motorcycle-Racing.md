Supercross BMX Racing: A Great Way to Get Kids Involved in Supercross Motorcycle Racing

Are you the parent of a child who enjoy racing?  Supercross motorcycle racing is a sport that has literally taken the United States by storm. Although individuals, of all ages, enjoying watching supercross racing, there is a group of individuals that enjoys the excitement the most. Those individuals are children, particularly young teenagers.  In fact, not all young teenagers just want to be fans, many want to become just like their idols, supercross motorcycle racers.

What is a parent to do, when their child wishes to become a supercross motorcycle racer? As a parent, you have the right to dictate what your child can and cannot do. Although supercross motorcycle racing is a fun and exciting sport, many parents are worried about the motorcycle part of it.  If you are one of those parents, you have a number of different options. All of these options will allow your child to follow their dream, but without you having to spend endless days and nights worrying about the safety of your child.

Perhaps, the best way to get your child started in supercross motorcycle racing is to purchase them an off-road motorcycle, especially one that is designed with kids in mind. These motorcycles are often smaller in size and relatively safe for children to operate.  However, as an extra precaution, you may want to enroll your child in a motorcycle safety class.  These classes are a great way to learn how to successfully operate a motorcycle, but you will need to find an off-road course, especially one that is designed for children.  It is possible to find these courses, but depending on where you live, it may be difficult.  

If you feel uncomfortable allowing your child to ride an off-road motorcycle, even those that are designed with children in mind, you may want to suggest an alternative. That alternative is a BMX bike. Supercross BMX racing is another popular variation of supercross motorcycle racing.  In addition to being popular, it is also safer.  Instead of using an off-road motorcycle, riders race off-road bikes.  Many of these bikes can be purchased from sports stores, bicycle shops, or even traditional retail stores.  As a parent, who is likely concerned about financing, you will also find that these bikes are easier to afford, when compared to off-road motorcycles.  

Besides the fact that BMX bikes are used instead of motorcycles, you will also find that most professional or amateur supercross BMX racing tracks are relatively shorter in size. Many races only last a few seconds or a few minutes.  Depending on the popularity of BMX racing in your area, you may even have a local supercross BMX racetrack nearby.  The good news, if you don’t, is that you and your child could easily make your own racing surface, right in your backyard.  This surface may be made of dirt or sand, your choice.  You can also add in as many or as little jumps and obstacles as you wish to.

Although supercross BMX racing is relatively safer than supercross motorcycle racing, you will still find that it is still a dangerous sport. For that reason, you need to make sure that your child has the right equipment. In addition to the correct bike, which should be an off-road BMX bike, you should also ensure they are decked out with the latest in safety equipment, such as helmet and protective pads.  It may also be a good idea to keep an eye on your child whenever they are participating in supercross BMX racing, whether it be at a local indoor sports complex or outdoors in your own backyard.  

Despite the fact supercross motorcycle racing and supercross BMX racing are not the same thing, you will find that they often require the same type of safety equipment. You may find that your child whishes to continue participating in supercross BMX racing; however, there is a good chance that they will still carryon with their dream of becoming a motorcycle racer. If this the case, BMX racing is a great way to prepare your child for off-road racing, until you feel that they are prepared to handle an off-road supercross motorcycle.
