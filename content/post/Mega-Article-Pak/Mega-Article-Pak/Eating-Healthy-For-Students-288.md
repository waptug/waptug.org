Eating Healthy For Students

For students, eating at college is an entire new
ball game, with late night pizza delivery and food
from buggies.  Even though some of these quick and
simple options taste great, they are probably 
not healthy for a student's body.  

The food choices students make can affect whether
or not they are able to remain awake during class
and whether or not they will come down with 
mononucleosis when it hits campus.  The problem
is not only about eating junk food, it's more 
about not getting the proper proteins, carbs, 
vitamins, and minerals that people need.

When it comes to defending against illnesses, 
vitamins and minerals are very important.  Just
because they are important, isn't a reason for
students to run out and stock up on vitamins and
supplements.  It's best for students to get their
nutrition from food.

You can find vitamin C in citric fruits, Vitamin
A in milk and diary products, and vitamin E in 
nuts, whole wheat products, and even green leafy
vegetables.  This is the ideal way to get 
nutrition, as your body relies on these vitamins
for many reasons.

When you eat on campus, skip on the soda's and 
go right to the juice machines.  Explore the 
different entrees available and go to the salad
bar where there are fresh vegetables.  You can
also try putting some broccoli and cauliflower
in the microwave for steamed vegetables.  There
are always healthy cereals and plenty of fresh
fruit available in dining halls as well.

Always remember that eating healthy isn't just
about avoiding greasy foods.  Eating healthy
involves getting a balanced diet and getting the
right nutrients and vitamins to keep your body
in peak performance - or at least awake during 
your classes.
