Do you Really Save Money if you Purchase Items in Bulk?

With the continued cost of various items in our society the concept of buying in bulk is getting to be more common that ever. Yet many people question if they are really saving money or not. The answer to this question that yes you will save money when you purchase the right items in bulk. For example you really don’t need to purchase a case of 200 light bulbs as that will last you for many, many years. On the other hand if you have a fairy large family or lots of guests on a regular basis you might consider buying toilet paper and paper towels in bulk.

Any item that you will use up in a short period of time is a good candidate for being purchased in bulk. There are many membership warehouses that offer bulk items that focus on families and small businesses. Dry ingredients for your home including sugar and flour are good options. Avoid buying bulk items that will result in eating the same thing day after day though as no one wants to have to do this. For example, don’t buy snacks and potato chips in bulk because everyone in your family will quickly tire of the taste.

If you find that such items like that are a good deal but more than you reasonably need, consider buying bulk items with another family. This way you can share the items and the expense. It is good idea to take the other party shopping with you so that everyone gets a fair say in what items will be purchased. You may need to be willing to try new brands of items to make this work. If the other party already uses that brand ask them to give you a sample. If you want them to consider your brand then offer them a sample of it to try as well. 

Meat is probably the best item you can buy in bulk to save money. This will likely involve investing in a freezer that can be kept in your garage or basement to store the meat in. You can purchase a whole beef, ½ a beef, or even a quarter of beef. Bulk meats of bacon and pork from pigs are also a good option. Once again you may want to consider sharing the products and the cost with a friend or relative. 

Canned goods last a very long time so you can purchase them in bulk and not have to worry about them spoiling. Some good choices are soups, canned vegetables, and various sauces that you will use for cooking. Babies are quite expensive as anyone with them can attest to. Buying diapers, baby food, and baby formula in bulk are all good ways to save money on those necessities. And finally, let’s not forget about the expense relating to feeding our pets. If you use dry cat or dog food then buying it in bulk may be a good option for you. 

Most people don’t change the type of laundry detergent or cleaning supplies they use very often. You can purchase these items in bulk and save plenty of money. Most of the time they will come in larger bottles that you can pour into smaller spray bottles. Make sure you have a cool dry place to store the remaining cleaning supplies that are out of the reach of children. 

To ensure you are really getting a good deal on bulk items, take the time to read the information relating to the cost of the item per unit. This way you can compare that price with the overall cost. In most cases you will be able to find some really good deals that save you money. On the other hand don’t be so quick to pick up that big package of what ever you are looking at without finding out how much each item is really costing you. Manufacturers have gotten very good at selling items on concept and package designs rather than pricing.
