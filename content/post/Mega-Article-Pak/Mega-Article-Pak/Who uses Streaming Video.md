Who Uses Streaming Video

When considering who uses streaming video, many people may be surprised by the actual results.  This is because almost everyone at one time or another uses streaming video.  We may not realize this at first, but in many cases this is because we are unfamiliar with what it is that constitutes streaming video and who offers streaming videos to the public.  Upon clarification of these things, we can see the truth as to who it is that uses streaming videos.  Video is the medium that is being used, much like other mediums include auditory devices or still images.  Streaming is the method through which the video is being transmitted.  By understanding that streaming is not a medium, we are able to think more concretely about who uses streaming video and how they are able to do so.  Streaming video is the series of images and sounds that are transported or transmitted from one source, to another location, from which the viewers will watch in the hopes of learning something or being entertained.

Television stations and channels are almost always offering streaming video, and this is because they are constantly sending out a signal that can be picked up by any individuals that are able to tune in to the station.  This means that many of us have been using streaming video long before the birth of the internet.  However, we are more familiar with this concept as a part of the internet because this is about the time when the phrase was begun to be used.  Still, this does not mean that the definition does not apply when it comes to sources like the television.

Many people will offer streaming video on their websites because it is very easy for people to use, and it takes less time than downloading in most instances.  Because of this, many people are drawn to the websites that offer streaming video clips, simply because of the convenience and freedom that this method is able to offer the individual.  A person does not need to wait very long in order to view their streaming video, since all the computer needs to do is connect to the host server and buffer the video.  This usually does not take much time at all.  People are able to enjoy their videos without having to download them and find them somewhere on their computer.  Streaming video also has less of a chance of being used by individuals as a method to infect computers, which is a problem with downloading.  This means that many people use streaming video to avoid this problem.

Not only can many individuals use streaming video, but there are a number of establishments that can benefit from incorporating streaming video into their websites as well in order to offer something new and fresh to visitors of the websites.  For example, the owners of blogs have begun to add these things to their websites.  Many news sites have been offering video streaming for quite some time.
