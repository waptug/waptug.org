Universal Studios Tours – Nickelodeon Blast Zone

If you bring younger kids, aged twelve and under, to 
Universal Studios, they will probably be most 
interested in the Nickelodeon Blast Zone. Featuring 
three attractions in one, this is one of the few 
attractions that really appeal to the younger crowd 
at Universal Studios Tours, so you can expect them 
to spend a great deal of time there.

Shaped like a huge orange rocket, the Nickelodeon 
Blast Zone is a big hit. This is a huge play area 
basically – and it is unlike any playground that your 
kids have ever experienced. There are three 
sections of the playground: The Wild Thornberry’s 
Adventure Temple, Nickelodeon Splash, and The 
Nick Jr. Backyard.

The Nick Jr. Backyard is the only place in Universal 
Studios that will be of any interest to toddlers. In 
fact, it is the only safe place for toddlers. If you 
bring a toddler with you to Universal Studios Tours, 
plan to spend the entire day here. 

Nickelodeon Splash is a water area. Bring a 
change of dry clothes, because the kids will get 
soaked here. They can fill buckets of water in a fun 
variety of ways, create waterfalls, and stand under 
waterfalls. There are also many mounted water 
guns to be used and enjoyed.

The Wild Thornberrys Adventure Temple is an 
extensive playground. While here, you will have 
foam balls flying through the air all over the place – 
the kids are able to shoot and throw them, and 
since they are made of soft foam, they are safe. 

The kids can also meet many characters here, 
including the Rugrats and Blue’s Clues Characters. 
The attraction is located on the upper lot, and is 
open everyday that the park is open. If you don’t 
want your child to get wet, avoid this attraction 
altogether, because with all of the water flying 
around and being dumped, there is really no way to 
avoid getting wet. If your child is too young to enjoy
 the attraction by themselves, you will be getting 
wet as well.

Overall, this is the only attraction that younger kids 
will enjoy at Universal Studios Tours. As a parent or 
guardian, you should expect to spend most of your 
time here, and you should never leave your child 
unattended. This is not a place to drop your kids off 
for the day while you go enjoy other attractions. 
Instead, use the buddy system with other 
responsible adults in your party – one should stay 
with the kids, while the other adults go enjoy the 
attractions, and relieve each other often so everyone 
has fun.
