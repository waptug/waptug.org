As we enter a new millennium, more and more people are seeking lifestyle changes that foster mental and spiritual well-being as well as physical fitness. As a result of this trend, the ancient discipline of yoga is currently undergoing a widespread renaissance. We are dedicated to bringing the benefits of yoga to the widest possible audience through the Internet. 

With this statement, wailanayoga.com launched its grand opening on the World Wide Web.

People are more aware than ever of the health benefits of physical activity and fitness, says Wai Lana. regular exercise has been linked to a reduction in the risk of heart disease, strokes, and cancer. Although it is common knowledge that exercise helps build and maintain healthy bones, muscles and joints, reduces blood pressure, and promotes psychological well-being, there is increasing consensus among health and fitness experts that physical activity doesn't need to be strenuous to be effective. Yoga offers the perfect combination of strength and flexibility.

Yoga's roots date back around 5,000 years when it was established as a form of meditation. The word 'yoga' in Sanskrit means 'union' - practicing yoga ultimately brings one back in touch with the state of union, or oneness, that exists at the core of every being, she added.
