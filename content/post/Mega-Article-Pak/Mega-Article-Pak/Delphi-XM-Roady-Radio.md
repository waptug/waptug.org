Delphi XM Roady Radio

The Delphi XM Roady Radio Receiver is the smallest radio receiver available on the market. It’s the next generation of radio, not only for being America’s most popular satellite radio service but for its power of choice, giving the listener the pleasure of choosing what kind of songs he wants to hear – wherever, whenever he wants. In short terms, you can listen to more than 170 digital channels, live concerts, daily news, live commentary on sports, etc. Plus, listening to music on your radio without any commercial is like a dream come true. The receiver is somehow smaller than SkiFi XM Receiver but it has a sharper look. Being able to use it with no major problems. The interface is user-friendly and the installation of  additional accessories lie the Roady FM Modulator or the power adaptor is very easy. As for the price, where you can use it and on which system, you can take a look below:

Price: $119.95
Use: Car or Home
System: XM Satellite Radio

The features of the Delphi XM Roady Radio are plenty:
- plug and play: you can easily connect to your home kits, car or audio systems, whenever you want
- you can search for channel, presets or category
- seven color displays
- smallest radio available on the market, together with the smallest antenna
- optional home audio
- the possibility of saving a total of 15 songs information


When buying a full kit, you will find in the box the following: receiver, micro-antenna, three faceplates, cigarette lighter power adaptor, cassette adaptor, universal mounting bracket and manual. It is told that the Delphi XM Roady is the direct competitor of Terk XM Commander, being slightly less expensive if you buy the Commander without the FM Modulator. As for the receiver, well.. how small can it be? It is very small. Like I said, it is the smallest receiver you can find out there to buy. The colors are quite brilliant, so that we could spoil our looks by watching red, green, sky blue, orange, night blue, purple and pink. If you’re really a fashion maniac, you can combine the colors with the three colored faceplates for a dazzling look. A very nice option on the Delphi XM Radio is the TuneSelect, where you can save a total of 15 songs, with detailed information upon them.

As for accessories, you can buy an additional home kit (base, antenna, power adaptor, mini-stereo to RCA output cable), Power / FM Modulator (rebroadcasting on the following frequencies: 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, 88.7, 107.1,  107.3, 107.5, 107.7, being available on the market since December 2003),  FM Modulator (which can be found at a price of  $49.99) or Mini Stereo to dual RCA Cable (with that you can connect your Delphi XM Roady to your stereo CD, in case that you don’t have a CD player).
As a conclusion, I can say that the Delphi XM Radio Receiver is a pretty good gadget to buy, the reviews being generally positive. That doesn’t mean you can’t buy something that won’t work as you would expect, but, if you choose the right place to buy (where customer service is a really important thing to notice), you would be very pleased of the acquisition. Overall, for its price it is an extraordinary unit.
