The Costs Of Tattoos

Once you have made the decision to get a tattoo, you’ll find yourself facing a very important task – the budget.  Tattoos have long been known to be very expensive, with the bigger ones costing up in the thousands.  Although you may be able to find some designs and studios that are within your budget, you’ll still face some very important decisions.

The cost of a tattoo is the most common question people ponder before they get a tattoo. Although they can be very expensive, they are still within your reach.  Most people who know they are getting a tattoo will save their money up.  Even though you may have an average job and don’t make a lot of money, a tattoo can still be well within your reach if you save your money up for a few months.  This way, you’ll have more than enough to spare when you finally get the tattoo you have been saving up for.

In the world of tattoos, you get what you pay for.  If you’ve got your own design that you want tattooed, tattoo artists will normally charge you anywhere from 30 – 250 dollars an hour.  If you want the tattoo artist to design a tattoo for you, you’ll probably end up paying more.  Depending on the size and location of the tattoo, you can easily spend thousands.  Tattoos that cover the entire back for example, can cost you as much as fifteen thousand dollars!

The best thing to do is to find a studio and design that you like, and then look into how much it will cost you.  You should always look for the cleanest and most sanitary studio first.  Once you have found a sanitary tattoo studio, you should meet the tattoo artists and talk to them a bit to see how friendly they are.  When you look at the prices of the tattoos, you should never sacrifice quality for price.  Even though a studio may cost you more, the quality will normally be better than other tattoo studios in the area.

Although you may be able to find a tattoo studio that will do their work for a cheap price, you should never rush into getting a tattoo strictly for the price. Even though a cheap price may sound good, the quality of the work could be lacking.  Tattoo studios that charge expensive prices normally do so because they have the best artists and the best quality work.

Once you have chosen a studio and had your tattoo done, you should always make sure to tip your artist.  If he does exceptional work, you should make it well worth his time and give him a nice tip.  Tattoo artists who do high quality work love to get tips – and they will always appreciate your business if you treat them as good as they treat you.
