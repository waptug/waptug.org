Motor Homes:  Should You Rent or Should You Buy?

Are you interested in using a motor home to travel across the country or for a camping adventure?  If you are, you may be interested in buying your own motor home. While it is more than possible for you to buy your own motor home, do you know that buying a motor home isn’t your only option?  In addition to buying your own motor home for a cross country trip or a camping adventure, you can also rent a motor home.

If this is your first time attempting to go motor home camping or on a trip across the country, you may be unsure as to whether you should buy your own motor home or rent one.

For many individuals, there is just something about buying a new motor home and being the first owner of it. When you want to buy a new motor home, you will find that it is a little bit easier to shop for exactly what you are looking for. Of course, it is possible to come across some great used motor homes, but for the largest selection of motor homes to choose from, you may want to think about buying new.

Although it is nice owning your own motor home, there are a number of cons or downsides to doing so as well. One of those downsides is the cost. Motor homes can be expensive to buy. While many used motor homes are much more affordable than new ones, the cost can still be quite high. If you are able to afford the cost of buying your own motor home, you may want to think about doing so.  However, if you are unsure as to whether or not you can afford a new or even a used motor home, you may want to examine motor home rentals.

One of the many reasons why motor home rentals are so popular is because they are affordable.  Instead of buying your own motor home, you are just renting one from someone else for the time being. This is great if you are taking your first cross country trip or if you are going on your first motor home camping adventure.  Buying a motor home can be expensive, especially if you unsure as to whether or not a motor home is really want you want.  That is why a large number of individuals make the decision to rent a motor home first.  Many who were satisfied with their experiences later buy their own motor homes and you can do the same as well.

Another one of the many plus sides to renting a motor home instead of buying one is the fact that the motor home isn’t yours.  While this may seem like it is a disadvantage, it actually be considered an advantage. When you rent you a motor home, you are just renting it for the time being. This means that you are not responsible for any mechanical repairs or any updates that may need to be made. This, alone, can save you a considerable amount of money. 

As for the con or downside to renting a motor home instead of owning one, the main downside is the freedom that you have. When buying a motor home, you have more motor homes to choose from. In the United States, you should be able to find a number of motor home rental stations, but they tend to be limited only to certain areas and the selection of available motor homes is often small. This means that if you were looking for something in particular, you may not be able to find what you were looking for in a rental.

The above mentioned pros and cons are just a few of the many that you may want to take into consideration, when trying to determine if you should buy your own motor home or rent one. While the decision is yours to make, you should take the time to make sure that the decision you do make is the best one for you and your needs.
