Reasons To Stage Your Home For Sale

If you’ve been thinking of selling your investment house or your home, you should make sure that you take full advantage of home staging trends.  There are several advantages to home staging trends, which we will take a look at below.

One of the best things about staged homes is that they sell in less time.  This is great news for sellers, as these types of homes will sell really fast.  In most cases, you won’t have to worry about your home staying on the market for a long period of time.  Research has shown that staged homes sell nearly 40% faster than other homes on the market. 

Staged homes also sell for more money.  Homes that have sat on the market for a long period of time will normally get lower offers due to the fact that home buyers will begin to think there is something wrong with the home.  Staged homes on the other hand, don’t sit on the market for long at all.  Once they are listed, they pretty much draw attention to themselves - resulting in a fast sale.

A staged exterior will also draw viewers.  When home buyers first arrive at a home that is up for sale, they instantly make up their mind whether they should get out and look around, or drive off.  If the yard is staged with flowers and the yard is manicured and properly taken care of, chances are that buyers will want to see more. If you entice your buyers by showing them how nice the home is outside, they will surely want to know what the home is like on the inside as well.

Once a buyer has stepped inside of the home, he will know within a matter of seconds whether or not he likes the home.  To get the buyer’s attention, you’ll need to stage your home to the buyer’s liking.  You don’t want the buyer to feel rushed or get the wrong impression, which is why you should always set the stage and entice the buyer to take his time and get a good look at the home.

Staging the living rooms and kitchens will also help to sell the home.  Buyers love living rooms, which is why you should always make sure that the living room is the center piece of your home, and decorate it accordingly.  Kitchens on the other hand, is where you should really go all out, decorating with fruit and such.  You should always make sure that everything is in place as well.  Buyers love to see homes that are ready to move into - and not ready to be worked on.

Staged homes will also attract more real estate agents and get more advertising as well.  If a real estate agent loves your home, he will want to show it off.  If you stage your home, chances are that real estate agents will eat it up.  When they do, they will advertise your home more than others, just to get you some deserved attention.  This way, you can benefit from a lot of exposure at absolutely no extra cost.

There’s no other way to look at it, other than staged homes sell.  They attract more buyers, more real estate agents, and they give people the feeling of home.  When you go out of your way to make the buyer feel that your home is his dream home, he will know it.  Homes that aren’t staged may sell, although staged homes sell much faster and for more money.  If you’ve been looking to sell your home, you should look into staging it and get the ball rolling in the right direction.
