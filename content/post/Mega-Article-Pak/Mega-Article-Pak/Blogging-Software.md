Blogging Software

With blogging becoming increasingly popular, there is also an increasing need for software to simplify the process of blogging. However, there are many different software packages available which can make selecting a package seem overwhelming. Selecting a software package does not have to be difficult though. Bloggers can find websites which provide comparison charts for different software packages to simply the decision making process. These charts can save the blogger a great deal of time and effort because they compile a wealth of information into one convenient location. The blogger may still need some additional information before using these comparison charts to make a decision. The article will provide insight into some of this additional information which may be useful such as how to understand the comparison charts, methods for comparing the software packages and tips on selecting a blogging software package. 

Blogging Software Criteria 

Those interested in starting or maintaining a blog should fully understand the blogging software criteria before attempting to compare software packages. Some of the criteria it is important to understand include the minimum server requirements, data storage and the post editor. Understanding these criteria is critical to the process of comparing and selecting blogging software packages. 

The minimum server requirements refers to the minimum requirements for the server on which the software is to be installed. In most cases the power and speed of the server is not relevant but instead it depends on the power and speed of the software necessary for the proper operation of the blog software. There may be additional costs associated with this software as well as additional license requirements.

Data storage is also an important part of evaluating blogging software packages. This may include options such as a flat file, a data file or a database. A flat file refers to storage options in which the full page is pulled each time the blog is requested by a browser. A data file refers to situations in which the data for the blog is inserted into a template when the blog is requested by a browser. A database refers to storage options in which the necessary information is pulled from a flat file and inserted into a template when the blog is requested by a browser. 

The post editor is another criterion a blogger may want to investigate carefully before selecting blogging software. The post editor refers to the type of editor which will be used to fill in the posts listed on the blog. These data entry methods may include options such as HTML or JAVA. 

Comparing Blogging Software Packages

Bloggers who are seeking a blogging software package should carefully compare the different software packages available. This is important because obviously some software packages are superior to others. It is also important because some software packages may be better suited for the needs of a particular blog than other packages. When comparing blogging software packages it is important for the blogger to first carefully consider the needs of the blog. This is important because it will help the blogger to realize which criterion is most relevant to his particular blog. 

Selecting Blogging Software Packages

After carefully evaluating blogging software packages, it is time for the blogger to make a decision and select one of the available packages. Ideally the blogger will have already compared important data such as storage space, server requirements and post editors. However, the blogger must also consider other factors such as cost and versatility. Many blogging software packages are available free of charge while there are some which are available for purchase. The blogger will have to decide whether or not it is worthwhile to purchase a software package or whether free software packages will meet his blogging needs. 

After considering software criteria and cost, the blogger should consider viewing sample blogs created using a particular software package. This is a good idea because these samples can provide a good indication of the capabilities of the software. This is because in general the higher the quality of the samples, the greater the capabilities of the software.
