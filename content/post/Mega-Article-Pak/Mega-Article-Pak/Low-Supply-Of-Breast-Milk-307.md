Low Supply Of Breast Milk

Almost all mothers who breast feed go through a 
period of questioning whether or not their supply
of milk is adequate.  Some mothers simply aren't
able to produce enough milk to meet the needs of
her baby.  According to many experts, true 
insufficiencies of milk are very rare.

A lot of women think their milk supply is low when
it actually isn't.  Thinking this can happen if
you lose the feeling of fullness in your breasts
or if the milk stops leaking from your nipples.
Babies that go through growth spurts may want
more milk than usual, and these more frequent
feedings may leave your breasts less than full.

Causes of it
A mother's milk supply may diminish for a brief
period of time if she isn't feeding her baby
often enough due to nipple pain, or a poor latch
on technique.  Illnesses or estrogen containing
birth control pills may also affect the production
of milk.  

What you should do
The best way to handle a low supply of breast 
milk is through a doctor's care.  You should
make sure that your baby gets frequent feedings
and that nothing is wrong with your nipples or
your milk ducts.  Doctors are the best ones to
ask, as they can run tests to see if everything
is fine within your body.

A low supply of breast milk can affect your 
baby, although it's more of a mental condition
than anything else.  If your baby isn't gaining
any weight or if he is losing weight, you 
should call a doctor immediately.  Improved
techniques for breast feeding will normally
help, although in some cases weight gain or
weight loss will indicate a serious concern.

In most cases, you can still nurse with a 
temporary decrease in milk supply, although
frequent breast feeding is the key to boosting
your production of milk.
