Budget Bass: Discount Car Stereo

Dying to satisfy that craving for that boom bass but can’t make the budget? Can’t sleep ‘cuz of that new Clarion head unit? Look no further, you just need to find that discount car stereo to fulfill your car audio needs.

Well, there are probably only two instances where a need for a discount car stereo will come in. These two instances always entail lack of a financial comfort zone (that’s why we call them discount car stereos). 

First instance, you don’t have an audio system in your car, and you would like to install one. Following the premise we have above, you’re most probably a car owner who doesn’t have enough cash to spend on a new, top of the line system.       

What to do: How do you get a discount car stereo? One way is to go to a car stereo sale. Still, you have to deal with store prices, they’re cheap, but not that cheap. Another is to scour the classifieds and buy and sell for second-hand items. These are real discount car stereos, but you have to have a sharp eye to recognize which is a good deal and which is a swindle. Ask the seller how many years he had it, in what car. Inspect the car where it is installed. If it’s still installed on the car, give it a go. If it’s just a head unit, or a speaker that isn’t installed, just be careful. Research the model of the discount car stereo you’re planning to buy, also find reviews.

Second instance: You already have a car stereo system installed, but you would like to upgrade it. Again, most probably you’re just searching for a discount car stereo/discount car stereo system not far from what you have. Maybe something with higher wattage, or a head unit which can play mp3s? And again, try searching at sales. Take advantage of classifieds, buy and sells, second hands, and also swaps. Chances are, if you’re a car audio enthusiast, someone in your circle currently has a better system than yours and maybe willing to sell it to you. No need for standard pricing here. Or if others have equivalent items which they might be willing to swap, like a head unit for an amplifier, or a nice set of tweeters for a cd changer (i highly doubt it) or your pedigreed pitbull for the whole shebang! You’ll get more discount car stereos if you have a circle of friends/people who share the same interest.          

Other tips which might help: Another way to get a discount car stereo is to SUBSTITUTE. Like cars, Japanese made units are often cheaper than German/European/American made units. Also, look at the basics. What is it that you need, as in the most BASIC FEATURES? Do you really need that mesmerizing LED display, or can you do without it? Goes for speakers too. If you’re not going to enter a car audio competition and you just want to hear good treble and bass levels without making your speakers croak, maybe you can do away with a couple of 3way/4 way speakers. A big subwoofer will definitely need an amplifier, and those are already 2 things to buy.

Discount car stereos are always a good deal, you just have to know where to get one.
