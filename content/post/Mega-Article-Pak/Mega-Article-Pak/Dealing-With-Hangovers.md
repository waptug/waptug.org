Dealing With Hangovers

A hangover is something that just about all of us have experienced at some point in time.  After spending a night out drinking, you may wake up in the morning with your head feeling heavy and your stomach in knots.  At that moment, you probably decided that you would quit drinking, to prevent this awful feeling from happening again.  No matter how hard you may have tried though, chances are that it happened again.

Even though we all know that alcohol can lead to hangovers, the cause of a hangover is something we don’t know.  Alcohol does have some positive effects on the body, although it can also lead to negative effects such as hangovers.  Some doctors will actually recommend it, while others will tell you never to drink it.  Even though drinking is good, moderation is the key.  The easiest way to avoid hangovers is to drink in moderation - and never get drunk.

As many of us already know, whisky, bourbon, and wine can result in a much harder hangover than vodka or beer.  For many people, chemicals in wines or yeast found in unfiltered beers can result in headaches.  Beer, wine, and liquor can be fun and relaxing to drink, although if you aren’t careful you can easily get a headache or a hangover.

Even though the cause for hangovers is unknown, it has been proven that the headaches associated with hangovers stem from dehydration.  With alcohol being a diuretic, it will make you urinate quite often.  Therefore, if you drink alcohol or beer on a daily basis, your body will remain dehydrated.  When you wake up in the morning with a bad headache and turn to coffee, which is also a diuretic, the process of dehydration actually gets worse.

You’ll also need to do something with the alcohol that has been left in your body.  Even though a hangover can make you want to stay in bed, the secret to getting yourself back on track is movement.  To rid your body of the alcohol, you’ll need sweat.  Sweating gets the toxins out of your body, and helps you feel better.  You can exercise or have sex to get over a hangover, as the heat your body emits will be too much for alcohol toxins to handle.

Although a hangover can be a bit of a pain, it can be prevented.  The first rule of drinking any type of alcoholic beverage is to never drink on an empty stomach.  If you eat a good meal before you start drinking, you’ll find that the food can help you digest the alcohol much better.  When the alcohol starts to attack your stomach, you should consider eating foods that are high in fat, such as cheese.  You can also sip some olive oil or drink some water.  The secret to making sure that you don’t get a hangover when drinking is to drink in moderation and never let yourself get too drunk.

Beer is digested very fast by your body, which is why you should always drink beer first if you plan to mix drinks.  Beer is digested the fastest, and will also help your body to absorb any other drinks you have faster.  You should always keep in mind that when you drink alcohol, your body will get dehydrated.  Any type of alcohol that you consume is a diuretic, therefore you should always drink water with your alcohol.  Alcohol can dehydrate your body very fast - which is why you’ll need water to ensure that you stay hydrated.
