eBay Data and Research – How Important Is It?

eBay is a business anyway you look at it. Sure, it is 
a great deal of fun for both the buyers and sellers, 
but when you look at it from another view point, you 
will see that it is a business from the seller’s point 
of view, the buyer’s point of view, and eBay’s point 
of view. 40 million dollars a day travels through eBay. 
Selling items on eBay successfully is an art, and 
eBay offers many different forms of Data and 
Research to ensure that you are selling the right 
items, to the right people, in the right way.

Some of the data and research is not free, but much 
of it is. The available resources include hot items by 
category, eBay Pulse, merchandising calendar, 
sales reports, marketplace research, buyer 
behavioral report, and the eBay solutions directory. 
These tools are quite easy to use, and the 
information that can be gleaned from them is 
extremely valuable.

The Data and Research tools are all accessible 
through your seller’s account, by clicking on the 
‘Advance Selling’ link. Learn to use those tools, and 
get your piece of that $40 million eBay revenue each 
day.
