eBay Sellers:  Why You Should Have an “About Me,” Page

Are you an eBay seller?  If you are looking for ways to make money from home, there is a good chance that you may be. When it comes to working from home or making money from home, one of the first places that people turn to is eBay.  The only problem is that to make money on eBay, you must be a successful seller.  There are a number of steps that you can take to become a successful eBay seller.  One of those steps involves creating an “About Me,” page.  

If you are relatively new to selling on eBay, you may not know what an “About Me,” page is. An “About Me,” page is a webpage that allows you to write anything that you want about you, the items that you sell, or type of services that you offer.  Due to the possibility of being scammed on eBay, a large number of eBay buyers want to do business with someone that they feel they can trust.  One of the best, yet easiest ways, to go about creating trust is by creating an “About Me,” page.  Although it may seem simple to you, it actually means a lot in the eyes of many eBay buyers.  And, to be a successful eBay seller, public perception is everything.

As it was previously stated, if you are interested in creating an “About Me,” page, there is a section where you can write whatever you want to write.  If you want to be a successful eBay seller, you will want to give information that you feel could be useful to you.  For instance, if you are selling on eBay because you are a stay at home mom or dad, you may want to write that, but in a professional matter.  Explaining your purpose for being an eBay seller is a great way to get an eBay buyer to see you as a person, just like themselves.  

If you consider yourself to be a fulltime eBay seller or if you specialize in a certain type of product, like kids clothing, you may want to mention that in your personalized “About Me,” section.  In addition to the samples outlined above, you will also want to add in anything else that you may find useful or something that you think will grab the attention or trust of potential buyers.  When making your own personalized “About Me,” page section, it is important that you use your best judgment.  Look at it from the perspective of an eBay buyer; what would you like to see on your own page?

In addition to your own personalized section, there are some sections that eBay automatically includes on a seller’s “About Me,” page.  One of those items is a summary of current items available for sale. For instance, if you have a number of auctions currently going, those auctions will be summarized on your “About Me,” page, for everyone to see.  All visitors are provided with a link to the auction listing, the current highest bidding price, as well as a short description of what is currently available for sale. In a way, having an “About Me,” page may also increase your chances of getting a sale, since a visitor to your page may see something that catches their eye.

eBay “About Me,” pages also commonly include information on feedback.  If you are an established eBay seller, particularly one that has a good feedback rating, this may work out to your advantage, as visitor will be able to see that you are reputable eBay seller.  If you have a number of feedback ratings, only a certain number, most commonly the recent ones, will be shown. This includes positive, negative, and neutral feedback ratings from your past eBay transactions.

Having an “About Me,” eBay page is completely optional, but, as outlined above, there are a number of benefits to having one.  With an eBay “About Me,” page only taking a few minutes to make, you are advised to at least give it a try. After all, you may be surprised with the results.
