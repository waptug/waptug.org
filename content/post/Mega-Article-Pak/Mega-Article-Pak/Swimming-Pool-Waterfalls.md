Swimming Pool Waterfalls

A lot of swimming pools these days are now featuring waterfalls along the edges to create a much more enticing visual appeal.  These types of waterfalls are built so the water falls down into the swimming pool, creating a continuous and never ending water flow with the pool.  Sometimes, there are small bulbs placed around the pool, helping to give the water a glittery effect once the water from the waterfall makes contact with the water in the pool.

Swimming pools that feature waterfalls are thought of as being more of a status symbol.  Normally, waterfalls can be found in the bigger hotels and resorts, and sometimes in big mansions if the owners can afford them.  There are other locations, such as popular water attractions and theme parks that have them as well.  

Waterfalls also provide a great attraction for little kids, as they like to play in the water as it goes up and over their heads - then comes down on top of them.  Depending on the size of the swimming pool, there can be several waterfalls attached.  Most often times, swimming pools that have multiple waterfalls can be found with exquisite resorts and the most popular of water parks.

These days however, waterfalls are becoming more and more affordable, and can be found with many private swimming pools.  You can also find smaller swimming pools that have smaller waterfalls constructed along the walls of the pool.  Even though they don’t produce a wide arc, they do create a splash effect that’s simply amazing to watch.

To use waterfall, you’ll first need a swimming pool.  The easiest way to construct a waterfall is when your pool is being built, so it can be built into the pool.  You must also make sure that the water going into the waterfall is clean.  You’ll also need to treat and clean the water going into the waterfall on a regular basis, as it can easily build up moss and algae if you don’t.

There are some waterfall models that will allow warm water to flow through them.  Keep in mind, warm water is used more for health than aesthetic appeal.  If you are using your waterfall for swimming, you obviously wouldn’t want to use warm water.  On the other hand, if it’s just for show or occasional use, then warm water waterfalls may be something of interest to you.

Although they are great to look at and watch, a pool waterfall can cost you a lot of money.  If you have the waterfall constructed at the same time you have your pool built, you can help save yourself a lot of money.  If you’ve thought about getting a waterfall - you should always plan things ahead and try to save yourself as much money as possible.
