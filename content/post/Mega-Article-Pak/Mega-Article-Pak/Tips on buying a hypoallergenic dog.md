Tips on Buying a Hypoallergenic Dog

If you suffer from allergies, you are not alone. Even though most people suffer from some type of allergy, whether it is food, plant, or pet, they can usually find a way to enjoy their lives, which in many cases, includes having a few pets. Depending on the severity of your allergies, you will be able to bring a dog into your home as long as you take the time to find the breed that is right for you. 

Hypoallergenic dogs are specific breeds that shed less hair and dander than other dogs, and produce fewer allergens in their saliva and urine. You should keep in mind that all breeds carry a certain amount of allergens, but hypoallergenic dogs carry less. Allergens can become stuck in carpets, on walls, and in bedding and clothing. This is why people have allergic reactions to their pets. In order to have pets, these allergens must be removed through frequent house cleaning, designating certain spots in the house for your pets to sleep, and by finding pets that have shorter hair and do not shed their skin cells as often. 

When looking for a hypoallergenic dog, you should research breeds that have short hair, shed their skin cells (dander) every few weeks rather then every few days, and do not product as much saliva. Since allergies can occur at different times during your life, you should spend some time with the breed of dog you are thinking of adopting. Visiting a dog breeder or a friend who has a dog will give you a better idea of which dog to adopt.

You should also consider your current living conditions. If you live in a small house or apartment, you may experience more allergy attacks because the dander and hair is confined to a small space. Adopting a small hypoallergenic dog is the best way to remedy this problem. If you live in a larger home, you should be able to purchase a larger dog. Letting the dog outside to run in the yard or by taking it for frequent walks will also help because your dog will be able to shed outside instead of inside on your carpeting and bedding. 

Once you bring your new dog home, you should give it a few weeks for your body to adjust. Your allergies may become worse before they get better, but after a month, you should see a difference. A hypoallergenic dog does not need any special care unless the breeder has specific health advice about the breed you are buying. 

Taking of your home by cleaning often and invest in a quality vacuum that will thoroughly clean your carpeting. If possible, you should replace your carpeting with hardwood flooring. This will keep allergens from piling up and causing an allergy attack. Wipe down the walls once a week and try to keep your new pet off your bed. These precautions will help reduce allergy attacks and help you have a fun, loving relationship with your dog for many years to come.
