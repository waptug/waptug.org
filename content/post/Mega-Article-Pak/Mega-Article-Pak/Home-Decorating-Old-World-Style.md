Home Decorating-Old World Style

The "Old World" Style of Decorating is one that brings all of the elements of nature into play. Metals, clay, stone, wood, and countless other elements combine to create an atmosphere that is as charming as it is ageless. This is what old-world means in a modern kitchen. Despite the idea that this would be an inexpensive method of decorating the truth is that this style of decorating for a kitchen, probably more so than any other room in the home, can add up fairly quickly. The good news is that the results are typically breath taking when all is said and done.

The kitchen of a home is often the family center. This is the room in which meals are prepared and sometimes eaten. It is also the room where families congregate and discuss plans for the evening and the events of the day. It is often the location in which homework is completed and heartaches are commiserated with pints of ice cream. Your kitchen is the one room in the home that will probably experience more emotional moments than any other room in your home. For this reason it makes perfect sense that it would be the most expensively and extensively decorated room within your home. 

When beginning with the walls for an old-world kitchen you may want to consider plaster or some soft of faux finish that looks like plaster in order to give the walls of your kitchen a truly ancient appearance. Aged yellows and shades of gold are an excellent choice for these walls as it will blend nicely with the terra cotta and stone accents that should grace the remainder of the kitchen as well as the darkly stained woods. Of course the walls are just the beginning.

You will want to insure that the lighting doesn't go against the old world home decorating that you are incorporating by being too modern and bright in appearance. Wrought iron light fixtures and chandeliers as well as low light wall sconces work wonderfully in an old-world style kitchen. Keep in mind that many of the old style home decorating ideas can spill over into the rest of your home from your kitchen or can be used in order to set your kitchen apart as the warm center of your home. Either way a kitchen such as this will make a stunning impression.

Candles may also be used in order to enhance the old world appearance of your kitchen. Of course candles are a great touch in every room of the house as far as I am concerned. They can be used to create an atmosphere, set a mood, or simply as a method of adding a subtle hint of fragrance to the air. In addition to candles, grapes are another great addition to an old-world style kitchen. From wine to the simple pleasure of grapes straight off the vine these tasty fruits are almost a must in a kitchen of this nature. Wrought iron wine racks large and small are a common addition to most kitchens of this nature. These racks may be used to hold wine as intended or can be used for other creative purposes such as to hold kitchen towels or some other creative means for those who do not drink wine.

Pottery and terra cotta are also welcome additions in this type of kitchen. They, much like the plaster, the colors, the wood, and the stone add another degree of warmth to a room that simply exudes warmth and charm to all who enter. Use pottery to hold commonly used utensils, straws, toothpicks, fruits, and vegetables that do not require refrigeration. Use platters as art and terra cotta planters to hold herbs that are growing along the windowsill. In other words, let your imagination soar when creating the old-world atmosphere in your kitchen. You just might be surprised at where it takes you.
