Eating For A Healthy Heart

Bad cholesterol or a bad diet is something we all
experience at some point in time.  It's impossible
to eat healthy our whole lives, even though we may
try hard to do it.  Eating healthy for your heart
is something everyone should try to do, especially
when it comes to restoring health and reducing
heart attacks.

Your heart and food
We know these things for sure - a diet high in 
saturated fats will help raise your cholesterol, 
which is a risk factor for heart disease.  People
that are obese are more prone to heart disease.  A
diet high in sodium may elevate your blood pressure, 
leading to inflammation and even heart disease.

To help prevent heart disease and improve your health,
put the tips below to good use.

Eat plenty of fish
Herring, sardines, and salmon are all excellent sources
of Omega 3 essential fatty acids.  Other fish are great
to, although Omega 3 may help to get your cholesterol
down to a healthier level.

Choosing healthy fats and oils
Saturated fat will increase the risk of heart disease.
It's found in meat, butter, and even coconut oil.  You
should avoid them until your cholesterol levels are 
down and you are at a healthy weight.  Even those
that love red meats can enjoy seafood and nuts for
their main sources of protein.

Monounsaturated fats such as olive oils will help 
you to protect your heart.  Olive oil is an ideal 
choice for cooking, dressing, or even as a dipping
sauce.

Plenty of fiber
Fiber can help you control your cholesterol.  You 
can find fiber in whole grain products to help
control sugar absorption as well, which will help
you keep your digestive system healthy.

Choosing carbohydrates
Eating for your heart involves staying away from
sugary foods such as candy, cookies, cakes, and
pastries.  Eating a lot of sugar isn't good for 
your heart disease at all.  Healthy carbohydrates
involve whole grain breads, whole grain pasta, brown
rice, and a lot of vegetables.  You should make
fruits and vegetables the main aspect of your diet.

Healthy cooking methods
Stir frying and sauteing with olive oil or canola
oil are both great methods, as you shouldn't dip
your food in batter and fry it anymore.  If you
cook chicken, remove the skin and bake it in the
oven in foil.

Instead of frying your fish you should always bake
it.  Steaming your vegetables can help maintain the
most nutrients.  You should use cream sauces or lots
of butter anymore either.  When you eat vegetables, 
try squeezing lemon juice on them or using your 
favorite seasonings.

As you make the proper changes to your diet, keep in
mind that it takes time for them to become habits.  
Eating healthy is always great for your body and your
lifestyle, especially when it comes to your heart and
the prevention of heart disease.
