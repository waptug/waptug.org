Process Of Homebrewing Microbrews

The normal batch of homebrewed beer is five gallons
in volume, which is enough for 2 cases, or 48 12
ounce bottle of beer.  

The typical homebrewed beer is produced by boiling
water, malt extract and hops together in a large 
kettle and then cooling the resulting wort and adding
yeast for fermenting.  Experienced homebrewers will
make their own extract from crushed malt barley by
a more complicated process of mashing the grain in
boiling hot water.

With both cases, the wort is boiled for 15 min to
an hour, to help remove some impurities, dissolve
the character of the hops, then break down some of
the sugar.  The wort is then cooled down to a 
pitching temperature.

The cooled wort is then poured into the primary
fermenter in a manner of aggression, as to aerate
the wort.  Sufficient oxygen is also necessary for
the yeast's growth stage.  The yeast is then put
into the wort.  

The primary fermentation will take place in a large
food bucket or carboy.  Sometimes it is left open 
but often stoppered with the carbon dioxide gas
that's produced by venting through a fermentation
lock.  

The process of making microbrews takes a lot of
time indeed, although you can take the necessary
short cuts once you learn more about how the
process works.  If this is your first time brewing,
you should always use common sense and know what
you are doing.

One of the best things about making your own 
homebrews is the fact that you can experiment with
ingredients and brew your own creations.  You can
brew almost anything, providing you have the right
type of equipment - which can easily be found.
