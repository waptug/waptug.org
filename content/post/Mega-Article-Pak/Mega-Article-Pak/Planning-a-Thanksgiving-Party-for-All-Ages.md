In general, a large number of party hosts like to plan parties that are only for adults or those that are only for kids. As nice as it is to plan a party just for kids or just for adults, it is sometimes difficult to do. There will likely always be parents who won’t want to part with their kids, even just for a few hours. That is why you may want to think about hosting a Thanksgiving party that is designed for individuals of all ages.

When it comes to hosting an all ages Thanksgiving party, you will likely find that a little bit more work is involved.

That is why, sometimes, a little bit more preparation is involved; however, that extra preparation will likely make your Thanksgiving party that much more enjoyable.  

As previously mentioned, you will need to have activities that target both adults and children.  You may want to develop party games that can be played with both adults and children or different games for each.

In addition to entertainment, you will also need to think about the food. In most cases, you will find that children and adults like to eat and drink different things.

In addition to soda, which is a common party beverage, it may also be a good idea to have to have plenty of water or juice drinks on hand. As for food, you may also want to create a couple of side dishes or snacks that target children.

For the best balance, between children and adults, it may be a good idea to encourage your guests to bring their children. In fact, having other children present may help to keep the other kids happy and occupied.  

The above mentioned Thanksgiving party planning tips are just a few of the many that exist.  As you can see, there are a number of different ways that you can benefit from or go about planning a Thanksgiving party for both adults and children.
