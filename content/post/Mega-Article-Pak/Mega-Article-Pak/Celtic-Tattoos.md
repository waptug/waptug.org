Celtic Tattoos

Celtic history goes back thousands and thousands of years.  Early Celtic people were well known for their skills in artwork of jewelry, metal, and even weapons. They were warriors as well, regarded as fierce fighters by the Romans.  Throughout Ireland, there are many examples and evidence of Celtic artwork and Celtic crosses.

Over the years, modern Celtics evolved and established symbols for themselves along the way. Throughout North America, Celtic people often wear these symbols to let others know that they are a Celtic descent.  The symbols and knowledge have been passed down through the years, as there is little no written history.  Tattooing however, keeps the Celtic tradition alive with the infamous Celtic cross and other popular Celtic designs.

Most Celtic tattoo designs come from Ireland, where the evidence of Celtic history is very strong indeed.  The Trinity College found in Dublin, Ireland, contains many manuscripts that document the Celtic heritage and symbols.  The height of Celtic tattooing however, occurred during the era when stone and metal work was really popular.

Celtic knot tattoos are some of the most popular and most common designs, featuring loops with no end that symbolize a never ending cycle of dying and rebirth.  There are also Celtic animal tattoo designs as well, which are similar in design to the knot tattoos, although the cords in the design normally terminate in heads, tails, and feet.  The pure knot tattoo designs are normally never ending, unless an individual adds an end to symbolize a spiral.

The meaning behind the knots in Celtic tattoos defies any type of literal translation and is found at a much deeper level.  The interlacing of the knots expresses the repeated crossing of both physical and spiritual elements.  The strands and their never ending path is a popular design for Celtic tattoos, representing life, faith, and love.  For many years, Celtics have used these designs for emotional as well as heritage purposes.

Those who are from a Celtic descent, Irish, Scots, or Welsh, normally find a Celtic tattoo to be a great way to express their heritage pride.  These tattoos help to reestablish pride, and give tribute to one’s ancestors.  The tattoos aren’t easy to do, most taking several hours.  Unlike other tattoo designs, Celtic tattoos are among the hardest designs in the world.

If you are from a Celtic descent and have decided to get a Celtic tattoo, the first thing to do is find an artist capable of doing the tattoo.  The designs are very difficult and not all tattoo artists can do them.  It’s always best to find a tattoo artist who has a background in Celtic designs, as this will ensure the tattoo is done correctly.  The artist who does the tattoo needs to have an eye for detail and exact line placement – which is a skill that not all tattoo artists possess.
