Tax Considerations When Re-Financing

For many homeowners the overall goals of re-financing are often paying less in interest overall and reducing monthly payments. When a homeowner is able to obtain a lower interest rate, there is usually the opportunity to re-finance the mortgage to capitalize on the lower interest rate. However, a lower interest rate does not automatically translate to a savings. The homeowner must carefully consider the amount of money they will be savings over the course of the loan in relation to the amount of money they will be spending to re-finance the mortgage. When the closing costs associated with re-financing are larger than the savings, re-financing may not be warranted. Re-financing can also have financial ramifications associated with tax options. 

Paying Less Interest Equals Less of a Deduction

In most locations, homeowners are permitted to deduct the amount of taxes they pay on their mortgage when filing their tax forms. This is usually quite a substantial deduction for homeowners who owned the home for the entire tax year. Those who re-finance their mortgage will typically be paying less money each year in taxes on the mortgage. While this is great in the long run, it can adversely affect the homeowner’s tax return. 

Consider a situation where a homeowner is located just below a major tax bracket which would be quite costly for the homeowner. As all ready discussed, re-financing may result in the homeowner paying less money in taxes each year. This means the taxpayer will be able to make a smaller deduction this year now fall above the tax bracket they previously fell below. When this happens the homeowner may find themselves paying significantly more in taxes. 

Consult a Tax Preparation Specialist

Determining the exact ramifications of paying less interest on a home mortgage on a tax return can be a rather tricky process. There are a number of difficult equations involved which can make the apt to make mistakes while trying to determine the consequences of paying less in taxes on the mortgage. For this reason, the homeowner should consult a tax preparation specialist when determining whether or not re-financing is worthwhile because the tax specialist can provide information regarding the impact of paying less in interest. 

In selecting a tax preparation specialist, the homeowner should seek out opinions from friends and family members if the homeowner does not employ a specialist to prepare their own taxes. This can be helpful because trusted friends and family members are only likely to recommend professionals they feel were knowledgeable, trustworthy and caring. A tax preparation specialists should have all of these qualities but should also be well versed in the area of tax preparation.
