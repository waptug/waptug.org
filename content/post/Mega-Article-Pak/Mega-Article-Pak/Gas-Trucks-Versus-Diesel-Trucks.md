Gas Trucks Versus Diesel Trucks

If you plan to use your truck like a car, desiring
quick, quiet acceleration and rarely ever haul a 
heavy load and don't plan to it for a long time,
you may want a gasoline engine.  Gas engines run
smoother, fuel is easier to find, and gas 
engines start easier in cold weather.

If you plan to use your truck for towing, value
good fuel economy and plan to put plenty of miles
on it, you may want a diesel.  The price to buy
a diesel truck is really high, although they can
offer you a lot in return.

Below, you'll find the leading vehicle manufacturers
and what they offer you.

Dodge
The 2500 and 3500 Dodge Ram Heavy Duty trucks are
the newest 3/4 and 1 ton trucks on the road.  Back
in 2002, the Ram didn't have enough power with
the 245 HP 9.5L.  Dodge promised more powerful
engines for the 2500/3500 platform and they
delivered on that promise.

The new base engine is the 5.7L gasoline V-8 
that's not only the most powerful engine of the
group at 345 HP but also revives the well known
and historical Hemi name.  

Ford
Ford helped push the 3/4 ton and 1 ton truck
market to where it is today when it introduced
it's international engineered power stroke 
diesel back in 1994.  Before 1994, these diesels
were poorly built and no match for the big 
inch gasoline engines.

From 1994 to 2002, over 70% of super duty Fords
were sold with the optional 7.3L V-8 diesel
engine.  This engine helped to put Ford among
the leaders in diesel trucks, as they had more
than they needed to dominate the market.

Chevrolet/GMC
The GM 2500/3500 twins Silverado HD and Sierra
HD both come standard with GM's 6.0L gas engine
V-8.  This engine is ideal for 3/4 ton trucks
where towing isn't a concern.  The upgrades
start with the 8.1L gas V-8 that's based on
Chevrolet's venerable big block engine.

Over the years, diesel trucks have proven to be
effecient with mileage, great for towing, and
easy on maintenance.  Unlike gas engines, diesel
engines do not have spark plugs, which means
you won't need to get them tuned up near as
much as gasoline engines.  

For those who like to haul heavy loads on a 
frequent basis, diesel is the way to go.  You
can get quite a few miles per gallon, and 
diesel trucks are built to go 250,000 miles or 
more before the engine needs to be rebuit,
making them a purchase that is more than worth
your money.
