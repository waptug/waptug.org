Common Cruise Ship Amenities  

Are you interested in taking a cruise?  If so, you are not alone.  Each year a large number of individuals consider vacationing aboard a cruise ship.  If you have never been on a cruise ship before, you may be wondering what activities, facilities, and services can be found onboard.  The activities found onboard a cruise ship will vary from ship to ship, but many cruise ships have a number of activities and services in common.

Some of the most well-known facilities found on cruise ships are dining halls, restaurants, and cafeterias.  Large cruise ships may offer a number of onboard dining facilities.  It is important to note that many of these dining facilities are considered upscale restaurants.  In addition to a sit-down restaurant, there area usually a number of small eateries located onboard.  Elegant dining restaurants are popular among cruisers.  To ensure that you are able to enjoy an elegant meal, you are encouraged to schedule a reservation as soon as you board the ship.

Aside from dining facilities, bars and dancehalls are also found on most cruise ships. As with most of the bars and dancehalls found on land, there may be age restrictions in place.  If you are traveling with your family, they may have to complete other activities while you enjoy the nightlight over the seas.  If this should occur, you are in luck because most cruise ships have daycare centers and other activities geared towards children of all ages.

When it comes to placing your child in the care of a ship’s daycare center, you are urged to quickly familiarize yourself with the staff.  This familiarization may help to calm your nerves.  It is also important to note that cruise ship employees are often closely monitored, highly educated, and properly trained.  While it may be difficult at first, you should feel comfortable leaving your child in the care of a cruise ship childcare worker.

Childcare is ideal for smaller children; however, if you are traveling with a teenager, daycare may not be an option.  Swimming pools, libraries, video arcades, and movie theaters can often be found on cruise ships.  Adult supervision is a policy that prevents children under a certain age from roaming freely around the ship.  
Teenagers may be able to visit these facilities without adult supervision.  Each cruise ship is likely to have different adult supervision policies.  You are encouraged to review these policies before purchasing your tickets.

In addition to the above mentioned bars and dancehalls, gaming halls or casinos can be found on most cruise ships.  As with gambling on land, there are age limits on those that can gamble aboard a cruise ship.  Popular gambling activities include slots, blackjack, poker, and much more.  Many onboard casinos are open for business twenty-four hours a day.  Gambling is a popular cruise ship pastime.  If you are booking a cruise just to gamble, you may want to further explore the gambling options aboard each ship.

Cruise ship operators know that many travelers take a cruise to escape their daily routines.  Unfortunately for some, one routine that cannot be left behind is exercise.  That is why almost all cruise ships have onsite fitness centers and fully equipped gyms.  These gyms are often similar, and sometimes even better, than the gyms found in your hometown.  In addition to a fitness center, a large number of cruise ships have jogging tracks.  

If a particular activity or event is the only reason why you are interested in booking a cruise, you are urged to physically check for that event or activity before making your reservation. The above mentioned services, facilities, and activities are found on a number of popular cruise lines. These cruise lines are likely to include, but are not limited to, Carnival Cruise Lines, Paradise Cruises, Royal Caribbean, and Celebrity Cruises.  With the click of a mouse or a toll free phone call, you can easily determine if your favorite activities can be found aboard the cruise ship of your choice.
