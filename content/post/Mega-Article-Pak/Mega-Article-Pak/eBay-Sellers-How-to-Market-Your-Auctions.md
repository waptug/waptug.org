eBay Sellers:  How to Market Your Auctions

Are you an eBay seller?  If you are, your goal is likely to make as much money as you can by selling products that you no longer need or want on eBay.  Unfortunately, there are now thousands, if not millions, of individuals who are interested in doing the same thing.  For you, this often means a steady increase in competition.  However, even with competition, you should still be able to make a profit when using eBay, but you may need a little bit of help.  That help could from marketing.

When many of us think of internet marketing, we often automatically think of online retail stores or online websites.  Although you are not running your own online retail store, you are trying to make a profit online; therefore, you are, in a way, like a retailer.  Just having your for sale items listed on eBay is enough to get your eBay items exposure, but you may want to think about taking it a step farther.  There are a number of different ways that you can go about marketing your for sale eBay items, without having to spend a dime.

Perhaps, one of the best ways to go about marketing your eBay items is by joining the eBay community, otherwise known as the online message boards.  When you talk with other eBay community members your screen name used is also your eBay name.  In the eBay community forum, every time that you start a new message or respond to an existing one your name is left, with a link to your main eBay webpage.  That is the age that outlines all of the items that you currently have available for sale.  Many eBay community members click other member’s pages just out of curiosity, but it not uncommon for someone to find something that catches their eye.  Simply starting a few conversations with other eBay community members, even just occasionally, may help to up your eBay exposure.

Another relatively easy way that you can market your eBay auction listings to the general public is by posting on a number of message boards, besides eBay.  There are a number of message boards that allow internet users, just like you, to post information on items that they have available for sale, both on and off of eBay.  Providing a link, as well as short description of some of the items that you are looking to sell is a great way to increase your eBay exposure and up your chances of making a sale. When taking this internet marketing approach, it is important that you only advertise your eBay listings in areas designated for doing so.  Spamming is not permitted on many online message boards and it may actually get you a bad reputation.

Speaking of using online message boards, there are a number of online message boards or forums that allow members to have signatures.  Signatures are where many people leave their name or a favorite quote of theirs, but some message boards allow members to use it as space to promote their products or businesses. Before posting a link to your eBay auctions, you are advised to examine the online message board’s policy concerning signature advertising.  Should it be allowed, you are advised to take advantage of this free internet marketing.  You will want to post a link to your eBay sales page, but be sure to mention that eBay is where all clickers will be going.

Another easy that you can promote your eBay items, particularly if you have multiple items for sale, is by putting a “please checkout my other eBay auctions,” message at the end of each of your eBay listings.  As with all of the other above mentioned internet marketing tactics, this is easy and free to do.
