The Benefits of Taking Your Child Outdoors

Children are active. Many children participate in a number of different after school activities, including sports. Unfortunately, when school ends, there are many children that do not know what to do. If you are the parent of a school aged child, who is currently on summer vacation, you may want to encourage them to go outdoors and play.  In fact, many children don’t think about it, but there are literally an unlimited number of benefits to being outside. 

Regardless of your child’s age, it is important to get outside.  Whether they enjoy relaxing by the pool or playing sports, they can benefit from the great outdoors.  To enjoy the outdoors, you and your child don’t even have to leave your backyard.  With a wide variety of different outdoor activities available, it is likely that they will never have a dull moment.  

As previously mentioned, there are literally an unlimited number of benefits to playing in your own backyard. Perhaps, one of the greatest benefits is that your child will be able to get exercise.  Getting outside and moving around is a great way to burn calories and stay fit. While all activities burn calories, there are a number of popular backyard activities that burn more than others. Those activities may include swimming, basketball, or volleyball. 

Depending on the age of your child, being outside may help them develop a love for the outdoors.  By encouraging your child to play outside, at an early age, you may be preparing them for a lifetime of outdoor fun.  It is best to take your child outside to play when they are young, but it is never too late.  No matter what the age of your child, you should regularly take them outside or encourage them to play in the backyard.

In addition to teaching your child to enjoy the outdoors, taking them outside may also be educational.  Many young children, especially toddlers, love to explore.  Together, you could explore everything that your backyard has to offer. To add extra excitement to your nature expeditions, you may want to consider purchasing books or resource guides on bugs, plants, flowers, or birds. They may help turn a traditional backyard activity into something that they will never forget.  

To peak your child’s interest with the outdoors, you may want to develop a number of other backyard activities.  These activities may depend on the age of your child. In addition to age appropriate activities, you will also find that certain backyard activities or games require the purchase of additional equipment. While some of this equipment may be expensive, you should be able to find low-cost alternatives at most retail stores.

Backyards are fun, but they are even better when explored with friends.  Whether you setup a play date with your toddler or allow your teenager to invite friends over, it is almost guaranteed that they will have a fun and memorable experience.  In addition to friends, you may also want to organize family activities in your backyard.  Backyard campouts and barbeques are a great way to experience the outdoors and spend quality time together.  You are encouraged to let your children assist you with organizing these activities. By allowing your child to help you prepare food or setup camping equipment, you may also be helping them understand the importance of responsibility.
