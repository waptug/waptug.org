When in Croatia, does as the Croatians’ do, and visit Zagreb.  The bustling city of Zagreb has so much to offer by way of Croatian culture and history, and is an excellent chance to break away from the slopes for a few days.  It is truly a cultural hotbed, and the hustle and bustle will betray the long and arduous past.  Looming above Zagreb is Mount Medvednica, and the Sljeme resort.  With both daytime skiing, and the option of hitting the flood-lit slopes at night. Along side highly technical snow cannons, Zagreb benefits from excellent snow coverage at this altitude, and is a fantastic city for a ski resort.  Additionally, there is so much by way of additional, complimentary facilities which make skiing at Sljeme an ideal prospect.

Many people are surprised to think that Croatia actually borders Italy.  However, the culture is so different from the Italian culture.  With an entirely different history and culture, the Croatians certainly place heavy emphasis on their food, and this is reflected in the top quality gourmet restaurants available.  Additionally, you’ll note exactly how cheap the entire country is, with your average pint of ale coming in at less than a dollar.  In Croatia, your spending money will go a lot further, and so will your holiday, which is why so many families choose it as an ideal destination for their skiing break.  So why not choose Croatia, and benefit from world class skiing, at a fraction of the price.
