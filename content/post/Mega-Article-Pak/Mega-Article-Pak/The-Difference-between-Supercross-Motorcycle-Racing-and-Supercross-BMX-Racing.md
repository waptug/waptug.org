The Difference between Supercross Motorcycle Racing and Supercross BMX Racing

If you were to perform an internet search on supercross, it is likely that you will come across a number of different results. The same can be said when searching for supercross books or videos at your local video or book store.  This is because supercross has a couple of different variations. Two of those most popular variations include supercross motorcycle racing and supercross BMX racing. If you are unfamiliar with racing, namely motorcycles and bikes, you may have a difficult time distinguishing between the two.

Despite the fact that you may have a difficult time telling the difference between supercross motorcycle racing and supercross BMX racing, it is important to remember that there is a difference.  In fact, that difference is a huge one. Supercross motorcycle racing is off-road racing that involves the use of an off-road motorcycle.  Supercross BMX racing is off-road racing that does not use off-road motorcycles, but off-road bicycles.

While supercross motorcycle racing and supercross BMX racing use different pieces of equipment, their purposes are still the same.  Supercross tracks are often man-made courses that compose of a number of jumps and other fun, exciting obstacles.  The same can be said for supercross BMX racing.  Although supercross motorcycle racing mostly takes place indoors, BMX racing is popular in both indoor and outdoor venues.  The goal of both is to successfully maneuver the track, showing off your skills, while still coming in first place.  

In addition to the equipment used, such as motorcycles versus bicycles, you will also find that the courses are different as well. These courses are both considered off-road courses; however, they tend to differ in style.  Most supercross motorcycle racing tracks are made of dirt, but many supercross BMX racing tracks are made with sand. Even though many BMX courses use sand, there are some that still use dirt. The BMX racing surface will all depend on the preference of race promoters.  You will also find that the tracks are relatively short.  The shortness of the track makes supercross BMX relatively shorter than most motorcycle events.  In fact you will find that these races are shorted by about fifteen or twenty minutes.  

When it comes to supercross motorcycle racing, as well as supercross BMX racing, there is a common misconception believed by many. That misconception is who the sport is for.  Unfortunately, many individuals only believe that supercross motorcycle racing is for professional athletes.  Professional supercross motorcycle racing is the most well-known variation of the sport, but there are others. There are supercross motorcycle racing events that are designed for amateur adult riders, as well as youth riders. These events may not be televised or receive the same attention as professional events, but they are still classified as being supercross motorcycle racing events.

As previously mentioned, the same misconception can be found with supercross BMX racing.  Since supercross BMX racing utilizes off-road bicycles, there are many individuals who believe that supercross BMX racing is deigned only for kids.  Although young kids, namely teenagers, enjoy participating in supercross BMX racing, they are not the only ones who enjoy the sport. In fact, supercross BMX racing is widely popular among adults and females. In addition to being a sport for children, many believe that professional BMX racers are not good enough to race motorcycles. This is simply not true.  It isn’t that these racers aren’t good enough, it is just that they prefer to race off-road bikes, instead of off-road motorcycles.  

As you can easily see, there is a difference between supercross motorcycle racing and supercross BMX racing. Although their names make the sports appear as if they are the similar or even the same, especially to those who are unfamiliar with the sport of racing, they are actually quite different.  Whether you to choose to be a racer or a fan or supercross BMX racing or supercross motorcycle racing, you will likely enjoy your decision. This is because both sports, despite their differences, are exciting to watch, as well as participate in.
