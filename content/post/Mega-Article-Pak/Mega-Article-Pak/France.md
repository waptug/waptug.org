Travel Tips to European Countries: France

About the city

The crowd is attracted to sparkling ski slopes of the Alps, sunlit vineyards and sun-baked beaches of this beautiful country. France is a country which draws more tourists than any other country. It is easy to see why this is the case given France’s great reputation for fine wines, good food, high fashion and relaxed lifestyle. But while France is undoubtedly a place to eat and drink till your heart is content, there's much more to this fascinating country than only cutting-edge cuisines. Spring is the best time to be here, and those interested in winter sports can drop at the Alps and Pyrenees with some polar gear. The summers are very hot and winters are moderate. An all-weather coat and pair of comfortable shoes are a must. Women, especially, should carry cocktail dresses as some of the restaurants ask for it. When visiting any religious site, refrain from wearing sleeveless shirt and shorts, as they are disliked at such places.  

Culture

English is widely spoken here, although French is the official language. Handshaking is 
customary greeting and women should be kissed on both cheeks and should be addressed 
as Monsieur or Madame. French people are popularly known for their like for stylish sportswear 
and of course perfumes. Nudism is allowed on some beaches only. Social functions, fine 
restaurants, and clubs call for more formal dressing. When at a formal dinner, wait till the host 
gestures to start the dinner. Smoking is banned in public places.

Site Seeing
