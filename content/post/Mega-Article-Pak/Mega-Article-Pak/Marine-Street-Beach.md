Marine Street Beach

Located near the upscale community of La Jolla, the
Marine Street Beach is a small cluster of high end
clothiers, hotels, shops, and galleries.  The 
beach is also legendary to body surfers and body
boarders due to it's thunderous waves which always
seem to crash the shoreline at the right time.

Keep in mind, this beach may not be ideal for 
families, as there are no public restrooms, picnic
areas, and the rough surf conditions aren't well
suited for children.  If you have a family, you may
want to find another beach.

Even though it isn't the best beach for families,
Marine Street Beach offers plenty of privacy and
gorgeous white sand that can make for a fun day
of sunbathing with friends.  

The rough waves found at this beach have been 
known to seriously injure swimmers and body boarders
in the past.  If you aren't that experienced with
the water, you should always make sure that you
repect both the water and the waves here.

During the summer months and on peak weekends during
the fall and spring, there are lifeguards stationed
on the beach.  You should plan to park on the 
street at Marine Street Beach, as there are no
public lots.  You should try to get here early,
as it can be very hard to find a parking space,
especially during summer and on the weekends.

Getting there
If you are coming from the north, take I-5 south.
Take the exit at Genessee Avenue, head west, then
make a left on Torrey Pines Road.  Go down the

From the south, take I-5 north to Torrey Pines
Road.  Once you arrive in La Jolla Downtown, 
simply follow the same directions from above.
