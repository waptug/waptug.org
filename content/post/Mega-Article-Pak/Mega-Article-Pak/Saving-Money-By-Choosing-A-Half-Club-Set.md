Saving Money By Choosing A Half Club Set

For a beginner at golf, buying a full set of deluxe clubs is almost always very foolish. When a beginner uses the more advanced clubs, he or she will likely encounter nothing but frustration. If you are a beginner and you want to buy some golf clubs of your own, you should look at some of the options that are alternative to buying a full new set of clubs. You can use a few different options (and even combine them if you’re lucky enough to find such a deal) to get golf clubs without doing too bad of a number on your wallet. The first way that a beginning golfer can get away with these huge savings is to buy a half set of clubs. This will not only save money and be lighter to carry, but it will also improve your game since you will have less of the more advanced clubs to choose from.

The half-set doesn’t have a combination that is set in stone. Usually you will end up having to choose a few to exclude and include. In most cases, a half set will include 4, 6, and 8 irons, as well a sand iron and a pitching wedge. It will include several woods, as well as a putter. Using these clubs, you will be able to have one available that will work in almost every situation. There are certain equivalencies between clubs that will allow you to drop them from your collection. For example, a 5 wood and a 2 iron have very similar. However, the wood will allow you more forgiveness if you hit it a little bit off-center. Therefore you can drop the 2 iron from your golf club set until you become enough of an expert to really need the unique hit it will give you.

Having a half set of clubs will usually allow for a beginner to really improve his or her swing before getting really involved in the game. Once you have had the half set for a while and you are proficient in using them and swinging them, you can begin to think about moving up to a full club set. The experience that you have gained from using the half set will carry over to the new ones, and you will be much more skilled than if you had simply started with the full set. It will also give you a chance to figure out your own personal preferences such as club length and head weight. When you buy the full set, you will be much more positive that it is the perfect golf club set for you.

You can acquire a half club set in one of several different methods. The first is to simply buy one that is geared towards beginning golfers. This could be a good choice, but you should definitely try them out before you buy them. An even better way to get a half-set is to mix and match individual golf clubs. Many club stores will allow you to do this, and you will just need to get some advice from an expert golfer as to which ones you will most certainly need when you are out on the golf course. Have a seasoned golfer come to the store with you and pick out all of the clubs in your half-set.
