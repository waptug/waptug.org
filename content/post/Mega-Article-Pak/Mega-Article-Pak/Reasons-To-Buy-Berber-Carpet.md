Reasons To Buy Berber Carpet

Everyone hears about Berber carpet, and just how great
it can be.  The carpet was named after a hand made
bulky wool that was textured and used by a tribe in
North Africa, the Berber tribe.  The Berber carpet
that is used even today follows the same tradition
of the tribe by using flecked bulky yarns to create
a beautiful carpet.

Below, you'll find several reasons why you should
choice Berber carpet over all others.

The carpet is unique
The flecked looped yarns that are used to make Berber
carpets provide a very unique yet stylish carpet
that makes Berber easily to identify.

Choice in loop sizes
There are several loop sizes with Berber carpets,
so there is always going to be a size for any room
or decoration, from the large knobby loops to the
small and tight loops.  There are several choices
as well, that include cut and loop designs, multiple
level loops, and even level loops.

Hypo allergenic
Berber is the ideal choice for anyone who has 
allergis or younger children.  The carpet is made
from wool so it's non toxic and non allergenic, and
it will stop bacterial growth on the spot.

Very comfortable
The manufacturing process that created the loops
of wool have millions of air pockets in them so
the carpet has a nice and cushioned feel when you
walk across it.  It also offers an insulation factor
due to the weaving which helps to regulate the 
temperature of the room as well.

Durability
Berber carpet is one of the most durable types and
also one of the easiest to clean.  The stains are
easily lifted from the carpet and it takes a lot
of miles on the carpet before it will even begin to
show any signs of wear.  

Berber is also well known for longevity, as it
always seems to look like it was installed yesterday.
It rarely ever shows footprints, and it doesn't
even show the lines from vacuuming.  The only 
thing you have to watch out for is snagging, as 
you don't want to snag the loops and damage the
carpet.

Affordable
This is actually a mystery, as Berber is pure wool
and still cheaper than nylon, olefin, or any other
type of man made carpet, even though it outlasts 
the rest and maintains a newer look over a longer
period of time.  Berber is one of the most 
affordable choices you can make and it still looks
richer than any other available choices.

Choices of colors
The color choices with Berber carpet are varied and
include earthen or neutral colors, dark colors,
and pastel colors as well.  There are plenty of
colors to choose from as well as patterns.  Berber
carpet offers more choices than any other carpet
type.

Hiding the sub floor
Because the density of Berber carpet is so thick,
you can easily hide anything wrong in the sub
floor without having to spend a lot of money having
the sub floor repaired of replaced.  This helps
to make Berber carpet very cost efficient in
older homes that need to have the carpet redone.

Grade variety
Just like with other carpets, you can choose from
a variety of grades that will determine just how
plush the carpet is.  Berber is available in 
several different grades, even a product grade
that is designed to go on over top of concrete.

Besides the fact that Berber is one of the most
economical carpets to buy, it is also one of the
most economical to install.  The carpet is easy
to lay, which will save you time and effort, making
it a truly excellent choice when it comes to
carpet for your home.
