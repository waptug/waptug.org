Formula Drifting, also commonly referred to as Formula D, is a sport that is sometimes termed as a racing sport. This has led many individual to believe that it is a form of stockcar racing; however, the reality is that it isn’t. Although the two sports do have certain things in common, they are quite different.  If you are unaware of the similarities and the differences, you may be wondering what they are.  

Perhaps, the greatest similarity between stockcar racing and Formula Drifting is the fact that cars are used.  That is why these sports are commonly referred to as motor sports or auto sports.  Although driving ability is important with stockcar racing, a focus is mostly placed on the cars, especially at the professional level.  With Formula D, the cars are important, but they are not nearly as important as a driver’s skills.  In fact, Formula D requires drivers to manipulate their cars. This manipulation often causes their cars to loose traction and slide in a particular direction, in other words a drift.  Essentially, a Formula D driver’s skills are ten times more important than what is underneath the hood of their car.

In addition the way that the cars are used, stockcar racing and Formula Drifting take place at different venues.  Professional stockcar racing, such as NASCAR, often takes place only on asphalt tracks. While Formula D events also take place on asphalt, they do not always use the full track.  In fact, Formula D events do not always require the use of a track. In the past, Formula D events have taken place in large parking lots or on city streets.  

With stockcar racing, the object is to finish in first place. This is not the case with Formula D.  As previously mentioned, Formula D requires the creation of a drift.  In competition, drivers are judged on their drifts, as well as a number of other factors. These factors most commonly include their speed and the ability to stay on the track.  When you think about it, there is quite a difference between the two sports.

From a fan perspective, it is also important to examine the ability to attend or view these events.

Although it may be harder to attend a live Formula D event, when compared to stockcar racing, you are find that the events are often easier to afford. In most cases, admission to professional Formula D events is only around twenty to twenty five dollars, a person.  

As you can easily see, there are a number of differences, as well as similarities, between Formula Drifting and stockcar racing.  In addition to the above mentioned similarities and differences, there are additional ones. The best way to familiarize yourself with these differences is to give each sport as chance.
