Healthy Breakfast Ideas

A lot of studies and research has shown that kids
who eat breakfast perform better in school and 
have a healthier diet.  Eating breakfast will help
promote the proper growth and maximize school 
performance as well.  

Breakfast is often times a victim of the morning 
time crunch.  Even though you may be tempted to 
skip breakfast, you can simplify your morning 
routine by following these 8 tips:

	1.  Finish homework and pack school bags
at night.
	2.  Decide on what your children will 
wear to school before you go to bed and locate 
lost shoes for the following day.
	3.  In the morning, get up 15 minutes
earlier.
	4.  Give up computer games and morning 
television.
	5.  Have healthy foods on hand.  You 
should also shop for breakfast foods with your kids
and take into account their personal preferences.
	6.  Set the cereal out the night before.
For younger children, fill a zippered plastic bag
with her portion, then add the milk in the
morning.
	7.  Allow your children to use the 
microwave often, as most breakfast foods can be
prepared in under 5 minutes.
	8.  Allow your kids to eat in the car or
on the way to school.

There are several foods that you can eat for 
breakfast, even leftovers from supper if they 
are sufficient.  You can eat bagels, pizza with
fruit juice, pretzels, or the normal bacon and
eggs that breakfast is known for.  Most foods are
a snap to prepare, and won't take you but a 
few minutes.

The next time you are in a hurry in the morning, 
remember that you are probably about to skip the
most important meal of the day. If you follow the
tips above, you'll find that you have plenty of 
time for breakfast.
