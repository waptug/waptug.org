Changing How You Eat

As you may know, not fueling up with the right 
nutrients can affect how well your body performs 
and your overall fitness benefits.  Even though 
healthy eating is important, there are myths that
hinder your performance if you listen to them.

Below, you'll find some myth busters on healthy
eating.

1.  Working out on an empty stomach.
If you hear a rumbling noise in your stomach, the
rumbling is trying to tell you something.  Without
listening to them, you are forcing your body to
run without any fuel.  Before you exercise or do
any physical activity, always eat a light snack
such as an apple.

2.  Relying on energy bars and drinks.
Although they are fine every once in a while, they
don't deliver the antioxidants you need to prevent
cancer.  Fruits and vegetables are your best bets,
as they are loaded in vitamins, minerals, fluid,
and fiber.

3.  Skipping breakfast.
Skipping breakfast is never a good idea, as 
breakfast starts the day.  Your body needs fuel
as soon as possible, and without it, you'll be 
hungry throughout the day.

4.  Low carb diets.
Your body needs carbohydrates for your muscles and
the storing of energy.  

5.  Eating what you want.
Eating healthy and exercising doesn't give you an
all access pass to eat anything you want.  Everyone
needs the same nutrients whether they exercise or
not, as well as fruits and vegetables.

6.  Not enough calories
Although losing weight involves calories, losing
it too quickly is never safe.  What you should do,
is aim for 1 - 2 pounds a week.  Always make sure 
that you are getting enough calories to keep your
body operating smoothly.  If you start dropping
weight too fast, eat a bit more food.

7.  Skip soda and alcohol.
Water, milk, and juice is the best to drink for
active people.  You should drink often, and not 
require on thirst to be an indicator.  By the time
you get thirsty, your body is already running a 
bit too low. 

Changing how you eat is always a great step 
towards healthy eating and it will affect how your
body performs.  The healthier you eat, you better
you'll feel.  No matter how old you may be, healthy
eating is something you should strive for.  Once
you give it a chance, you'll see in no time at
all just how much it can change your life - for the
better.
