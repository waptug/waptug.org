Disneyland Vacations for Toddlers

Disneyland was designed for kids of all ages – and 
toddlers are no exception! There are many things 
that you can enjoy with your toddler – so many 
things in fact, that unless you will be staying for 
several days, you won’t have time to do them all.

Start with Toon Town. Here is where you will find 
your toddler’s favorite Disney Characters, including 
Mickey and Minnie Mouse. All of the Characters 
have homes in Toon Town, full of things that will 
amaze your toddler, and make them laugh. 

Your toddler will definitely enjoy the Disneyland 
Railroad. This is a great way to get around the park, 
because there are stations in New Orleans Square, 
Toon Town, Tomorrowland, and on Main Street. This
will amuse your toddler, and give you a chance to 
see some sights and rest a bit.

Its A Small World is very appropriate for toddlers. 
Music and colors will keep your child mesmerized 
while you enjoy a relaxing ride across the water. The 
Storybook Land Canal Boats is another good choice, 
as it will take you through the miniature villages that 
your child will be quite familiar with from their story 
books. 

Rides that you and your toddler must not miss 
include all of the rides in Fantasyland, King Arthur’s 
Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, the Circus 
Train, and the Mad Tea Party. Rides that are 
appropriate for youngsters, but that may cause a 
little fear are the rides that are dark. These include 
Peter Pan’s Flight, Pinocchio’s Daring Journey, Alice 
in Wonderland, and Snow White’s Scary Adventure. 
Buzz Lightyear is a popular ride for all toddlers. 

There are other areas of the park that have 
attractions and rides that are appropriate for toddlers. 
Remember that Disneyland is a place for kids of all 
ages. Pay attention to the height and age requirements 
for each attraction, and avoid taking your toddler to 
rides that they will not be able to enjoy. This will only 
cause your child disappointment. 

Stick to the areas where the toddler appropriate 
attractions are located as much as possible. As an 
adult, you realize that some rides are simply not safe 
for small people – but your small person will not 
comprehend this! Your Disneyland vacation should 
be enjoyable for everyone, and Disneyland has 
made sure that there is something for everyone at 
the park. It is up to you to keep your child happy, 
and to keep them interested in the rides and 
attractions that they are meant to enjoy.
