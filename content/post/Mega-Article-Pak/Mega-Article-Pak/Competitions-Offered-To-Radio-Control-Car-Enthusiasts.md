Competitions Offered To Radio Control Car Enthusiasts

When you build a remote controlled car, you usually pour hundreds of hours, and even more dollars into making it a creation that you can be proud of. Well, after you have put so much effort into it, how much fun is it to just keep it all to yourself and never show off what you have worked so hard to complete? Some would say that it is a complete waste of effort. If you are building a radio controlled car, you should plan on entering it in many different competitions. There are quite a few RC car competitions of many different types. Here I will go over some of the main kinds of competitions that you can get involved in. Each one requires a type of car that is specifically tailored to it. Sometimes you can swap a few parts out and have a car that is ready for a different competition, but more often than not it is a totally different type of car.

The first type of competition is the kind that most people would imagine; a simple race track. It’s set up just like a NASCAR event. A large paved road is used as the track, and all of the cars are lined up in rows at the beginning. The number of laps can vary greatly, from sprint races to longer marathon races requiring dozens of laps. At these events, speed is the number one factor. Nobody will care if your car looks ridiculous if it is capable of speeds far higher than those of the competition. In these competitions, you will find the highest level of technical detail put into cars, with high-tech engines prevailing. Light, gas-powered cars with firm wheels are the best type of car for these competitions.

The second type of competition is definitely a fun one, and perhaps the most popular. It is the same as the first in the fact that it is a race. However, this race occurs on an off-road track. An off-road track will usually include lots of rough terrain, with steep hills and perhaps even ramps or obstacles. These tracks will really give the cars a beating. Most entrants will have remote control cars that look more like trucks, with huge shock absorbers. Many creative methods are used to keep cars in the running. Some even have wheels on both sides, in case the car flips over when it hits a bump. Many advanced driving techniques are required to stay in the running, and this is what makes off-road racing one of the most exciting sports.

Finally, there are exhibition competitions that are designed to consist of short segments. These segments show off one particular skill of your car – its agility, its speed, or its handling. You will be asked to accelerate down a straight road, just to see the maximum speed that your car can reach. You can also do slalom events, winding in and out of cones. The exact setup varies greatly from competition to competition, but you can always expect something along these lines.

Any competition involving remote control cars is most likely to be a fun time, even if you don’t have what it takes to win. It’s good just to go and have the company of your fellow radio control enthusiasts.
