Aspen Nightlife – Theatre in the Park

Founded in 1983 by Kent Reed, Theatre in the Park 
has become an Aspen tradition that adds to the 
delight of Aspen nightlife. Theatre in the Park once 
actually was theatre that was performed in a tent in 
the park. Now, however, Theatre in the Park has 
changed its name to Theatre Aspen, and a new 
permanent structure is in development. This will 
allow Theatre in the Park to hold year-round 
performances, instead of summer-only performances.

Contemporary and classical plays are all presented 
by the theatre. If you are in Aspen around Christmas 
time, make sure that you see the theatre’s 
presentation of “Its A Wonderful Life.” As a summer-
only venue, sixty shows are performed each year. 
Once the company has its permanent structure, we 
can expect many more each year.

The Theatre Aspen also has many training programs 
for adults and children. Currently, performances are 
held between June and August. The Theatre in the 
Park is located in the Rio Grande Park. Heat is 
provided on chilly nights, and there is an area to enjoy 
cocktails during intermissions, as well as before and 
after performances.
