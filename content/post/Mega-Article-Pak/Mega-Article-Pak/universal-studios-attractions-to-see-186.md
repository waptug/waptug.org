Universal Studios Tours – Attractions to See

If you are planning a trip to Universal Studios, there 
are many attractions to keep you occupied, 
including the Universal Studios Tour, which takes 
about one hour. However, there are some attractions 
that absolutely must not be missed!

All of the rides have a movie theme, and if you’ve 
seen the movies, this makes the rides more 
enjoyable. Start with Backdraft. This isn’t actually a 
ride, but it is a fire show that features lots of stunts 
and interaction. Other shows that must not be 
missed include Animal Planet Live, WaterWorld, and 
Fear Factor Live. With Fear Factor Live, make sure 
that you know what you are getting into before you 
agree to participate!

Terminator 2: 3D is the same as the movie 
Terminator 2 – but it is in 3D, which you probably 
have not yet seen. The Mummy Returns: Chamber 
of Doom is like a haunted house that you walk 
through, which is full of thrills. The Studio Tour will 
have you on the set of Jaws and Psycho, in a 
western town, on a New York street, and 
experiencing an earthquake with King Kong.
