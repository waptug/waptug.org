Chartering a Private Yacht versus Taking a Traditional Cruise

Are you looking to enjoy a vacation on the water?  If you are, you may have assumed that your only option involves taking a cruise.  While you can take a cruise, it is not your only option if you are looking to enjoy a vacation on the water.  You might not have known this, but you can also charter a private yacht.  When chartering a private yacht, you are given your own personal yacht, for a specific period of time, as well as your own yacht crew.  It sounds nice doesn’t it?  While it does sound nice, you may be wondering whether you should charter a private yacht or stick with a traditional cruise.

When it comes to determining whether the taking of a traditional cruise or the chartering of a private yacht is right for you, you are advised to do a little bit of comparison. Thoroughly examining the chartering of a private yacht, as well as the taking of a traditional cruise is one of the best ways to decide which is right for you.  Some important points that you will want to keep in mind, when doing so, are outlined below.

One of the many reasons why traditional cruises are preferred is because they are relatively affordable.  There are many families who end up finding that a cruise is financially within their reach.  What many of these families do not realize is that the chartering of a private yacht may also be finically within their reach.  There are a number of yacht chartering companies that base the cost of a charter on the type of yacht being chartered and the length of that trip. In many instances, you will find the cost of charter to be the same whether you are traveling with only two passengers or six. Depending on the size of your family or traveling party, you may even find it cheaper to charter a yacht than take a traditional cruise.

When you take a traditional cruise, you are given access to an unlimited number of onboard activities.  It is not uncommon to find cruise ships that have casinos, fine dining restaurants, salons, swimming pools, hot tubs, and game rooms.  While many of these establishments and amenities cannot be found onboard a traditional yacht, you are often given access to a number of other fun activities.  For instance, you may be able to go swimming in the ocean, right off of your yacht, scuba diving, or snorkeling. Some of these activities are not allowed on traditional cruise ships.

The amount of privacy that you receive is also extremely different. Although you are given your own cabin or room aboard a traditional cruise ship, that tends to be the only privacy that you receive. Whether you want to enjoy dinner or dancing, you must do so with other cruise ship passengers.  On a private yacht, you are given the utmost level of privacy possible.  Yes, you will also be traveling with a yacht crew, but that yacht crew is advised to give your own personal space and privacy.  In some instances, you may not even realize that they are on the yacht with you!

The above mentioned differences, between a traditional cruise and the chartering of a private yacht, are just a few of the many that exist.  These differences should play an important part in your decision to take a traditional cruise or charter your own private yacht.
