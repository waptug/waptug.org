Why I started Snowboarding Classes

Let me tell you all about the time that I went to snowboarding classes and why I absolutely think that you should go out there and do the same. When you learn something new it provides and excellent sense of well being and can result in many hours of fun and enjoyment that can come as a result of the new skill that you have attained. When I was only 16 I really liked watching winter sports on television and although it may sound stupid, it was actually sledging that drove me to want to learn a winter sport. I always liked sledging and I even went sledging when it wasn’t snowing. You see, where I live it is absolutely impossible to go sledging 11 months of the year, and if we are lucky enough to have as much as a month of snow then I am always sure to take advantage of it and go out their and sledge away! That is why, coupled with my love for watching snowboarding and sledging on television, that I decided that I would go out their and learn how to snowboard.

So you are probably wondering why I made the choice of snowboarding over skiing as my choice for the winter sport that I would try. The main reason for this was because I have a lot of friends that do snowboarding but absolutely none that do skiing done at the local ski slope. Although they do snowboarding the slope caters for both and I suppose the decision really did come down to me. Anyway, in the end I decided to go out their and choose snowboarding and I would be lying if I said my friends were my only influence in my decision to choose the board over the ski’s. You see I do not know if everyone will know what I am talking about but I feel that a snowboard just appears to be so much more responsive than ski’s. Do you know what I mean? At our local ski slope there is only 100M of run that is around 300 feet if you convert it. In that period on ski’s what can you actually do? If it was some kind of complicated slalom then that would be different, but just going down a hill on ski’s to me seems slightly boring compared to on a snowboard. A snowboard appears to be more of a white knuckle ride. That is why I decided to choose snowboarding, but don’t get me wrong I still think that skiing looks fun, and as I now go down to the skiing slope every week or so I have actually started to do skiing some times for a bit of a change. You see, once I learned how to snow board I had some transferable skills, such as an ability to use the lift, how to handle speed, when to slow down etc. That is why I am glad that I learned how to snowboard first. If I had skied first, then I would probably have found it a lot more difficult to pick up snowboarding second. Anyway I went to snowboarding lessons and really enjoyed myself, I am not as good, nor as dedicated as some of my friends but I still really enjoy myself and that is what it is all about.
