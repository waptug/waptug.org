Make the Most of Your Universal Studios Tour

If you will be visiting Universal Studios, you need to 
be prepared. Arriving at the park unprepared can 
literally ruin your vacation! Follow these tips to help 
you get the most out of your Universal Studios Tour 
adventure.

It will be very hot. Make sure that you dress in 
cotton clothing that is cool. You should strongly 
consider bringing a change of clothing, so you can 
change into dry clothes after the rides that soak 
you, or if your clothes get too sweaty. If you will be 
there during the evening hours, bring warmer 
clothes to change into. Do not wear new shoes! 
There is a lot of walking involved, and you won’t 
last one hour in brand new shoes. Wear an old 
pair that are well broken in. Bring an extra pair of 
shoes to change into if yours get wet.

Make sure that you bring earplugs. There is a lot of 
noise at Universal Studios, and some of the 
attractions are deafening. Also bring sunscreen, 
sunglasses, and hats to help protect you from the 
sun. Use a backpack or a fanny pack to carry your 
belongings in – there are also lockers available 
through guest services if you need a safe dry place 
to store your things.

Make sure that you take the Universal Studio Tour 
early in the day. The park will remain open several 
hours after the tour has closed for the day. 
Designate a meeting place with everyone in your 
party, in case you get separated. Make sure that 
everyone in your party has a map, and that they 
know how to read it!

Leave small babies and toddlers with a sitter. They 
will not enjoy Universal Studios, and they will make 
sure that you don’t enjoy it either if you bring them. 
Consider purchasing VIP passes which will allow 
you to move to the front of the lines for the 
attractions. This is a huge time saver, and will keep 
you from wasting valuable time and getting bored.

Avoid eating inside the park if you can. It is very 
expensive, and the food is much cheaper right 
outside the gates in City Walk. Also save your 
shopping for the end of the day, so you don’t have 
to carry packages around with you. Universal 
Studios Tours does have a package delivery 
service, which will allow you to pick up your 
purchases at the end of the day near the exit, in 
case you find a souvenir that simply won’t wait until 
closing time.

Most importantly, see and do as much as possible, 
and have fun! Universal Studios has been entertaining 
us for years, and entertainment is what Universal 
Studios Tours is all about!
