The History of Formula D Racing

When it comes to Formula D Racing, otherwise known as Formula Drifting, there are many individuals who want to learn more about the sport.  Many are focused on how the sport runs, while others are focused on the popularity of it. When trying to further examine the sport of drifting, it is important to take all of those questions into consideration; however, many individuals automatically skip something important; the history of Formula D Racing.  Whether you are a new fan of the sport or an old one, it is important that you know, understand, and appreciate the history of Formula D Racing. Without that history you wouldn’t be able to enjoy the sport that you have come to love.

Formula D Racing is most commonly known on a professional level. Although professional drifting is relatively new to the United States, the sport of drifting is not. In fact, drifting has been around in the United States for over thirty years. Its existence was not on a professional level, but on an underground level.  Why there is little talk about this type of racing is due to the fact that underground activities are usually used to describe secret or illegal activities. In many areas of the United States, street racing is considered illegal; therefore, drifting would have been as well.  

As popular as underground drifting was, it was dangerous.  Many of these underground events took place on city streets or at other unsafe locations.  For that reason, a small drifting association was created. In addition to creating a safe drifting environment, often at local racetracks, additional member benefits were established. These benefits included training events and much more.  It was later Slipstream Global who announced that they were developing another company. That company later became known as Formula Drift, Inc.  

Formula Drift was the first and is currently the only organization that owns and operates a professional drifting series in the United States.  This series, as mentioned above, are commonly known as Formula D. In addition to Formula D, professional drifting is also referred to as Formula Drift or Formula Drifting.  This series was formed in 2003; however, Formula D events did not begin taking place until 2004. In April of 2004, Road Atlanta, in Atlanta, Georgia, was home to the first ever professional Formula D event.

Since the Formula D series officially got started, in 2004, additional tracks have been added. In 2004, there were seven venues that were added to the circuit. As the years go on, it is expected that additional events will be added. In addition to added venues, Formula Drift, Inc also reached an agreement with G4TV.  G4TV, a popular television network, has retained the rights to air Formula D events, as well as additional programming, which is centered on the sport. If adding Formula D programming to their network wasn’t enough, G4TV also has reached an agreement with iTunes.  That agreement allows Formula D podcasts to be available to iTunes users.  These podcasts, as well as the iTunes program, are all free to acquire.

As you can easily see, there is quite a bit of history behind Formula Drifting. In fact, when you think about it, that history is quite exciting.  Without the influence of Japanese drifting and the forming of a drifting alliance, it is quite possible that drifting may still be underground, instead of being known as a professional sport.
