eBay Business Solutions

If starting an eBay business is your goal, as 
opposed to just auctioning a few items off for some 
extra cash, you need to use the eBay business 
solutions that are available to you. Because eBay’s 
success depends on the success of its sellers, 
they strive to help you at every turn. eBay Business
Solutions is the key to starting an eBay business.

eBay Stores is one of the better solutions for eBay 
business owners. An eBay store will allow you to 
list multiple quantities of the same item, and allow 
you to keep them listed for longer time periods. 
eBay Store owners also enjoy lower auction fees, 
and have access to advanced merchandising tools. 
Eventually, you should consider upgrading to an 
eBay Pro Store, which will allow you to customize 
your storefront with your own brand and web 
address. 

There are many other eBay Business Solutions, 
such as seller tools, the eBay solutions directory, 
and the merchant solution center, but you should 
definitely start with your very own eBay store, 
followed by an eBay Pro Store.
