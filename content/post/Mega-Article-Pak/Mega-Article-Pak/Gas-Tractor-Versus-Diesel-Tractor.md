Gas Tractor Versus Diesel Tractor

There are many different reasons as to why a diesel
compact tractor is superior to a gasoline garden
tractor.  

First of all, the diesel engine doesn't have the 
parts that normally wear out or give problems.  There
are no spark plugs, rotors, points, or distributor
caps like the garden tractor.  There is no carburetor
either, that will gum up and be hard to start after 
being stored for a long period of time.  Diesel engines
can be stored for long periods of time and still start
right up.

Secondly, diesel engines in most tractors are water
cooled.  This will allow the engine to run at a more
consistent and cooler temperature, which will extend
the life of the engine.  The typical properly 
maintained diesel engine can run thousands of hours
without breaking a sweat - and without having to be
rebuilt.

Diesel engines will also make more power.  Even though
gasoline tractors may be a little quicker to start
with, they can't begin to match the power and raw
torque that diesel engines offer. 

Another reason why diesel tractors are better than
gas is the available attachments. Most gasoline 
tractors are equipped with a belly mower and don't
normally have a three point hitch.  This will severely
limit the type of implements that you can use and
also limit the tractors expandability.

Most blades and scoop implements won't work with a
gasoline tractor.  The drive train will also limit
the type of implement you can use with a garden
tractor.  The typical gasoline garden tractor is 
belt driven, while a belt drive won't pull as much
load as a diesel powered tractor.  You would probably
not be able to use a box blade or tiller either 
with the average gasoline powered tractor.
