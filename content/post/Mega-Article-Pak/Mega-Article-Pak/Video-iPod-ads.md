Video iPod`s ads

	
IPod video was a surprising new device at its appearance, due to the new and exiting quality that it could offer: playing videos. Besides this, the iPods have known, since their appearance on the market, a constant evolution, which lead to the fact that the public and the potential customers had more and more expectations regarding this product. With a new offer and design, the new product iPod video had a series of new ads, some authentic and some suspicious, because of their fake or less real aspect. 	
	
Due to the fact that the product was not yet in stores and people didn’t expect such a product to appear, there were a number of teasing and controversial ads (regarding their authenticity) which appeared and circled on the Internet. By bringing a new and relevant feature to the device, such as the video feature, the potential customers were surprised by the evolution of the product and so, the ads purpose was established. One of these ads represents the iPod video in an unreal shape (meaning that the authentic iPod has other optical features and another design). The ad was very short, as it lasted only 15 seconds. The video begins with presenting some corners of the new device, which are revealed in a computerized manner. 

This one side of the device turns and the other one presents a screen which played the most recent music video belonging to the band Black-Eyed Peas (Pump it). The music and rhythm were dynamic and fast and so were the characters, who were dancing while driving. Suddenly, the slogan Introducing the new hand held movie theatre appeared and shortly after, the phrase new hand held movie theatre was cut out and the new phrase new iPod appeared on the screen, resulting Introducing the new iPod. 

The controversy around this ad is focused on the fact that the actual iPod video doesn’t have the same characteristics as the one in the ad: the actual device looks very similar to the 1st to 4th generation of iPods, meaning the screen is over the buttons, but the one revealed in the ad presented a very large screen, which completed one side of the device. 
	
Still, there are many ads of the new iPod video which are, for sure, authentic. The main idea of these is the fact that music can be seen, as well, besides just being heard. This is why the Apple company opted for integrating famous artists in the ads for their product: one of the ads featured U2's Original of the Species from the Vertigo - Live From Chicago DVD and another two featured Eminem and Wynton Marsalis. The ads featuring these artist were much longer than the usual ones and they basically played famous songs, but not together with their videos; instead, the producers opted for some more authentic images illustrating performances of these artists, which would look natural and more spontaneous. The ads for this new product were focused on the video playing capabilities of the device and the producers wanted, at the same time, to symbolize the new range of possibilities that the new model of iPpod had to offer. 

The main idea of the ads was clear, even though these 3 ads had very different targets. Based on the fact that the clients of the new device come from different backgrounds and are of different ages, the producers and the marketers managed to pick some artists that represent generations and symbolize best their tastes and lifestyle: Eminem stands for teens and hip hop music, Wynton Marsalis is representative for adults who like classical and jazz music and U2 is somewhere in between the other 2 opposite styles. 
	
In parallel, the ads with the dancing silhouettes continued with more specified backgrounds, which were representing the video options. The iPod`s video ads show that the product has definitely evolved, has a more mature image and optimized new features.
