Planning an Adult Only Thanksgiving Party

Have you recently made the decision to host a Thanksgiving party?  If so, have you decided on which type of party you would like to have?  If you are looking for a nice way to celebrate Thanksgiving with other adults, namely your friends, you may be interested in hosting an adult only Thanksgiving party. An adult only Thanksgiving party may not only be a little bit easier for you to plan, but it is a party that your guests will likely enjoy attending. 

When it comes to planning an adult only Thanksgiving party, as previously mentioned, the planning is a little bit easier than the planning associated with a children’s party or a party that is for individuals of all ages.  Despite the fact that it may be easier to plan an adult only Thanksgiving party, you will still find that there is a fairly large amount of planning and preparation that is needed. In most cases, you will find that the sooner you start planning your adult only Thanksgiving party, the sooner you can start to enjoy yourself.  

As with all other parties, including Thanksgiving parties, it is important that you invite your guests. In fact, before you start planning the rest of your Thanksgiving party, it is advised that you invite your guests first. Thanksgiving, as well as the rest of the holiday season, is a busy time.  You will want to give your guests their invites early, preferably at least a month in advance. An early invite will help to ensure that your guests do not make other plans for that day or evening.  It is also advised that you inform your guests, on their invitation, of your party status.  Unless your Thanksgiving party guests know that your party has an adult only theme, they may bring their children along with them.

After you have started inviting your guests, or at least made a guest list, you can begin to start planning and preparing for the rest of your Thanksgiving party. One of the first things that you will want to do is decide what type of food, drinks, or snacks that you want to serve. Since you are having an adult only party, it may be a good idea to have alcoholic beverages on hand.  It is not required that you serve alcohol at your Thanksgiving party, but you will likely find that most of your guests expect you to.  In addition to whether or not you want to serve alcohol at your party, you will also need to decide whether or not you want your party to include dinner.  If not, a wide array of snacks should be more than enough.

Although we often associate party games with children, there are many adults who enjoy playing party games.  Party games are a great source of entertainment for any party, including an adults’ only party.  Online, you should easily be able to find a number of adult themed party games.  You can find these ideas with a standard internet search.  In addition to using the internet, you can also find a collection of party games at many of your local retail stores.  While these games will likely not have a focus on Thanksgiving, you and your party guests may still enjoy playing them. 

It may also be a good idea to decide where, in your home, your Thanksgiving party will take place.  Many party hosts have their parties in more than one room, but the decision is completely yours to make. Many Thanksgiving parties take place in the kitchen, dinning room, family room, den, or living room.  In addition to preparing your rooms for your party, by cleaning them, you can also decide how you would like them decorated.  Any party, including a Thanksgiving party, isn’t complete without a little bit of festive spirit; spirit that Thanksgiving party decorations generate.

As you can see, there is still a fairly large amount of planning that goes into hosting an adult only Thanksgiving party. Despite all of the planning and preparation that is needed, you will likely be pleased with your decision to host a party for your family, friends, and anyone else who you choose to invite.
