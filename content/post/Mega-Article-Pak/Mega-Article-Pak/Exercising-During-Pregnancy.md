Exercising During Pregnancy

Everyone knows that exercise is very good for your
health.  During pregnancy, exercise can have many
other benefits as well.  Normally, exercise should
be light, especially during your first few weeks
of pregnancy while your body adjusts to the changes.

Any type of heavy exercise can divert the blood
flow from crucial areas, and most women that exercise
on a regular basis should tone down their workout
regimen during pregnancy.

Swimming, walking, and yoga are two very popular
exercise activities that are suitable for pregnant
women.  There are other forms of exercise such as
weight lifting that are acceptable as long as it
isn't too strenuous.  Most specialists recommend
exercise 3 - 4 times a week, unless you have a
medical condition that prevents it.  If you are ever
in doubt, you should consult a physician first.

Below, you'll find some of the best reasons as to 
why you should exercise during pregnancy.
	1.  Exercise can help to reduce the length
of labor and recovery time.  The right exercise
routines will also increase stamina that is needed
for delivery.
	2.  Improved mental health.  Exercise can
lower stress and improve your emotional health,
making it easier for you to get through the 
new experience of becoming a mother.
	3.  Exercise can also help with weight
management after the child has been born.  A common
concern with most mothers is the weight they lose
after pregnancy.  During pregnancy, exercise can
make postpartum weight loss easier.
	4.  Exercise is very good for your unborn
baby.  By keeping your body healthy, you are also
looking out for your baby as well.
	5.  Exercise can help reduce the side effects
of pregnancy.  Symptoms such as fatigue, headaches,
swelling, and constipation are all common with
pregnant women.  Studies have shown exercise to
reduce the occurrence of these symptoms.
	6.  Exercise can also decrease the risk
of premature birth.  Exercise has been proven to
decrease the risk of premature birth by at least
50%.

You should always make sure that you drink plenty 
of fluids before you exercise, follow a nutritious
diet, and avoid over exertion.  You should also
listen to your body, and if you start feeling
sick you should immediately stop and rest.

If you exercise during your pregnancy, you'll find
it a lot easier to deliver when the time comes.
Exercise will help your body strengthen up, which
will make it very easy on you when you go into
the delivery room.  Women who don't exercise find
it much harder when the time comes to give birth.

Exercising during pregnancy is one of the best
things you can do for yourself and for your unborn
baby.  Your baby will reap some of the benefits,
which is reason enough to exercise.  Always be
safe when you exercise, and don't hesitate to ask
a doctor for advice if you have any questions at 
all.  As long as you exercise safe and use good
common sense, you'll do a world of good for 
your pregnancy.
