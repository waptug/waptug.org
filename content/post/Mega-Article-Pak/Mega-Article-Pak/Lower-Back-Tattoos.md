Lower Back Tattoos

On a woman’s body there are a few places that can be thought of as sensual.  Although this varies from culture to culture, many consider the most sensitive areas to be the nape of the neck and the infamous lower back.  With that being said, it’s really not hard to see why lower back tattoos have become so popular over the years.  

Although women have several areas for tattoos, the lower back is one of the most erotic and sensual areas women can get tattooed.  Lower back tattoos are easy to cover up as well, which is great for those who aren’t allowed to have tattoos at work.  Unlike other areas of the body, the lower back is completely covered up by a shirt.  With the lower back – you only show the tattoo off when you want.

The ease to show or hide lower back tattoos has helped to increase popularity, as well as the desire, or sensuality.  When a woman tells someone, especially a man, that she has a lower back tattoo – the mind often wonders.  Lower back tattoos create a sensual and tantalizing appeal.  Normally, these tattoos are done around the waist line.  While part of it may be hidden by a women’s birthday suit – there may very well be a part of it showing as well.  For lovers, a lower back tattoo can be very sensual and sexual, a secret that is shared only between the two.

The various designs and shape of the tattoo will often times enhance both the look and the appeal of the entire lower back area.  The design of the tattoo is normally a small and shallow curvature that enables it to fit perfectly to the curves of the female back and natural curves of her hips.  The lower back tattoo helps to accentuate an already breathtaking part of the female anatomy and enhance an area that is well known for its sensuality.

Popular designs for lower back tattoos include flowers, vines, and stars.  Winged creature designs work good as well, as the wings of the monster can stretch his wings across the entire lower back region.  Angels, dragonflies, and birds also seem to work quite well.  You can add natural designs to the creatures as well, including plants and flowers.  The lower back is a great area for tattoos – giving you unlimited possibility to use your imagination.

Although there are a lot of options and designs available, you should always choose one that you can enjoy for the rest of your life.  You should always give thought to a design, and not pick something just because it’s appealing at the time.  Instead, you should look into the thought and meaning of the tattoo and decide if it’s something you can see yourself with for the rest of your life.  The meaning behind a tattoo is important, both now and later on in life.  When you look at designs, you should always pick the one that literally calls out to you.

Before you decide to get a lower back tattoo, you should always look at several designs first, and then decide the best one for you.  If you can’t find a design that you like, you can always have a professional tattoo artist design one for you.  This way, you can have a tattoo design based on what you want.  Although a custom design may cost a bit more money – it’s truly worth it if you want a unique and creative design that enhances the look of your lower back.
