Most Fuel Efficient Vehicles

Most efficient overall - Honda Insight hybrid
With 60 mpg city and 66 mpg highway, the Honda hybrid
has top honors as most fuel efficient in the United
States.  With a 1.0 gas engine mated to an electric
motor, the insight was designed to make the most
of the power by using low resistance tires.  The
bad things about the Insight include a cramped 
interior, seating for two, and a very odd styling.

Fuel efficient mid size car - Toyota Prius hybrid
(60 mpg city and 51 mpg highway)
The Prius, unlike the Honda Insight, is capable of
carrying 5 people plus their gear.  The Prius will
generate a total of 110 HP from its gasoline engine
and electric motor.  The sleek shape to the Prius
has a low co-efficient drag although Toyota has 
managed to do this with a larger, yet more driver
friendly vehicle than the Insight of Toyota.

Most efficient compact car - Honda Civic hybrid
(49 mpg city and 51 mpg highway)
With a reputation of being the cheapest hybrid in
North America, the Civic hybrid takes the great
design of the regular Civic and makes it a lot more
efficient.  With an output of 110 HP, the Civic
hybrid is very competitive for the class.  

Most efficient sub compact car - Volkswagon diesel
(37 mpg city and 44 mpg highway)
The Volkswagon Beetle diesel is ahead of even the
sub compact hybrids.  Making 100 HP, the Beetle 
diesel may not sound that powerful, although the
177 lb-foot of torque will put shame on every
other vehicle in the same class.  

Most efficient station wagon - Pontiac and Toyota
(30 mpg city and 36 mpg highway)
The Pontiac Vibe and Toyota Matrix are both the 
result of a joint venture of Toyota and General
Motors.  Both vehicles come equipped with Toyota
engines, although a lot of the design and 
engineering came from General Motors.  Both the
Matrix and the Vibe are versatile with active
lifestyles.  With a fuel efficient 1.8L 4 cylinder
that produces 126 HP, the Matrix and the Vibe 
aren't going to win a street race although they
make up for it with smoothness, efficiency, and
refinement.

Most efficient large car - Hyundai Sonata
(24 mpg city and 34 mpg highway)
The Sonata is a major surprise, beating out very
stiff competition.  The 2.4L 4 cylinder engine is
very smooth, responsive, and powerful.  The
suspension however, is soft, and geared more
towards comfort than handling.  This isn't a BMW,
although the build quality is great, clearly
demonstrating that Hyundai is no longer a second
rate manufacturer.
