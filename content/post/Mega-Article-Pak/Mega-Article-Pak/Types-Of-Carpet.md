Types of Carpet

The carpet market is a vast market, with many types 
to choose from.  Below, you'll find the several
different types of carpet and what they will offer
you and your home.

Woven
Woven carpet is produced on a loom that is very 
similar to woven cloth, being cut pile.  There
are many different colored yarns being used and the
entire process is capable of producing very intricate
patterns from designs that are pre-determined.  
Normally, woven is the highest quality of carpet
on the market.

Tufted
This type of carpet is produced on a tufting machine
by using either a single colored or sometimes a
non colored yarn.  If non colored is being used,
then the carpet will be dyed or printed with a
design as a separate process.  Carpets that are
tufted can either be cut pile, loop pile, or a
combination of both.  Machines can produce a lot
more meters of carpet than weaving, and they are
normally at the lower end of the market.

Needlefelt
The needlefelt type of carpet is a bit more
technologically advanced.  They are produced by
electrostatic attraction of individual fibers
that form a unique carpet with extremely high
durability.  You can normally find needlefelt
carpet in the contract market such as in hotels 
or other places where there is always going to be
a lot of traffic.

Flatweave
The flatweave carpet is created by interlocking
warp and weft threads.  The types of oriental
flatwoven carpet include soumak, plain weave,
and tapestry weave.  This type is not well known
in the North American region, although it is 
very popular in the orient and Japan.

Hooked rug
This is a simple construction of rug that is
handmade by pulling strips of cloth such as
wool or cotton through the meshes of a very
sturdy fabric.  Now, this type of rug is generally
known as a handicraft.

Knotted pile
With knotted pile carpets, the structural weft
threads will alternate with a supplementary 
weft that will rise from the surface of the 
weave at a perpendicular angle.  

Cut and loop piles
The cut and loop pile combines both looped and
cut fibers.  They provide a variety of 
surface textures for medium durability.  Cut
and loop carpets are available in either solid
or different colors.  The several different layers
in this carpet can hide dirt and footprints in
formal and informal areas.

Saxony
Saxony consists of tightly twisted cut piles 
that are heat set straight.  They consist of 
two or more fibers that have been twisted
together in a yarn, and they provide a very
soft texture for informal as well as formal
areas.  They will show each and every footprint
and even marks from vacuum cleaners.

Textured saxony
Textured carpet is the best selling and it 
works well in informal areas due to the very
soft feel.  They are tightly twisted and 
texture headset for medium durability.  They 
also offer a multi colored look that will
hide tracks and footprints.

Plush/velvet
Both plush and velvet are lightly twisted and
offer a uniform color.  They are very soft
and offer more level than textures.  This type
of carpet is ideal for formal areas due to
it's luxurious appearance.  

Frieze
Frieze is a highly twisted cut pile type of 
carpet that is suited for high traffic areas.
It has short fibers that will tend to curl 
in different directions at the surface to
hide footprints and vacuum marks.

Level loop pile
The level loop pile is constructed by weaving
even loops of yarn into carpet backing at both
ends.  This type of carpet is durable as
well as track resistant, due to the strong
loops.  Higher loops in the carpet will create
a more luxurious look.  They are also great
because they will prevent dirt from filtering
on into the carpet.
