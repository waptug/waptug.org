All About The Window Blind

Window blinds are coverings for windows, normally
attached to the interior side.  Window blinds refer
to some device to hide from sight or to help
reduce sunlight.  There are several kinds of blinds,
which are covered below.

Venetian blinds
Venetian is a large category in blinds.  The original
types were made with wide curved metal slats, 
similar to a mini slat.  The shapes can be curved,
flat, or even elliptical.  

Faux or PVC
These types of mini blinds are made from a solid
or foamed poly vinyl chloride plastic.  PVC is one
of the newer materials being used for blind slats.
The slat's surface can be smooth or embossed with
a wood grain.  Although color selection is limited
mostly to whites, there are a few wod tone colors
available as well.

PVC or faux are very durable, UV resistant, 
waterproof, and simple to clean.  The main drawback
with faux blinds is the weight of the slats.  PVC
slats are heavier than both wood and composite 
slats and when used with large windows, they can
make raising the window a difficult task.

Composite blinds
Composite type blinds are made from a combination
of wood products and polymers.  Composite is a
newer material that's being used for the window
covering.  The slat surface with composite is a
smooth poly coating or even a solid composite
material.  

Similiar to PVC, the color selection is normally
limited mostly to whites although there are a 
few wood tone and stain colors available.  The
composite blinds are priced in the low to mid
range.  They have qualities similar to PVC and
faux, and are some of the best available.

Wood blinds
Both value and premium wood blinds are made 
from real wood.  The value wood blind slats are
made from assorted Oriental hardwood, and the 
premium slats are made from American hardwood,
which is normally Basswood.

If you plan to match a cabinet or trim stain,
wood blinds will be your best choice.  Wood blinds
are among the best, although they are also among
the most expensive.  All wooden slats can warp 
and may fade in color over time.  They are also
the lightest material available and work really
good with large windows.

Since they were first introduced to the home, 
window blinds have proven to add style and peace
of mind.  They offer you a lot for your windows,
and they don't cost a lot of money.  You have
several different types to choose from, all you 
have to do is select the best types for your 
home and your needs.
