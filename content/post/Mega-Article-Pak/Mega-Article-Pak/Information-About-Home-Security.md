Due to this fear, some may even hide weapons in the house.

Each and every one of these fears that people develop stems from incidents that have happened in the past to others.  These days, people are getting more cautious about protecting their loved ones and their homes.  Most use burglar alarms, keep their doors locked at all times, never open their doors to strangers, and keep their windows locked.  When going out of town, they will inform neighbors that they will be away – and then will invest in a home security system.
