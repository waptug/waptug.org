Affiliate Marketing Tips

No matter what you may have heard about affiliate
marketing, it's impossible for everyone to make
5,000 - 10,000 dollars a month, as there is simply
too much competition.  There is also no money that
will fall into your hands without you doing anything
for it.

With that in mind, you'll find some high level tips
below that will help you make money with affiliate
marketing programs on the internet.

1.  Google and Overture
Even though the days of free traffic aren't completely
over, they are surely fading away quickly.  You can
choose to work hard creating web pages that score
well in the search engines, although it's very hard 
to do.

By paying for clicks with Google and Overture, you'll
have the top three positions on the search engines 
that matter the most.  If you hope to generate web
traffic from Yahoo, all you need to do is be at the
top of Google.

2.  Your own email list
Sending offers to your very own email list is the 
ideal way to build freedom and residual income.  
Instead of sending traffic away then hoping for 
the best, you should instead have your own email 
list to which you are able to send multiple offers.

3.  Your own affiliate program
If you knew that each filled out form on your site
generated .50 cent in revenue, would you still be 
willing to pay someone else .25 cents to generate
that same traffic?

The most overlooked ways of generating traffic is
having others generate it for you.  There are many
advantages to this method, including the fact that
others will be getting your traffic for you.

When it all comes down to it, everything involves
paying for traffic in one way or another.  To 
make more income, you'll need to invest very
wisely in advertising.
