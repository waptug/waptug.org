How To Make Money

With affiliate programs, it really pays to work well
with others.  Also known as referral programs, 
affiliate programs are normally commission based
sales.  You'll recommend a site to your visitors and
then pick up a percentage of any sale that those 
visitors make.  You'll benefit from the commission
and the merchant benefits from the sales.

If you already have a website set up, you can run
an affiliate program from it, or you can simply 
build a site to promote a particular product or
service.  As long as it brings in more cash than it
takes to build or run it, you'll be fine.

With any marketing program, you'll need to be careful
when you select an affiliate program.  The benefit
of an affiliate program will give you another way
to make money from your users.  Instead of selling
them a product, you simply send them to a partner
then take a cut of the profits.

Even though it may seem tempting to go for programs
with the highest commissions, those programs won't
pay you anything if your visitors don't buy them.

Below, you'll find some tips to help you select an
affiliate program that's right for you:
	1.  Do not accept any less than 25% with
commission.  You can find many programs with great
payment structures and high percentages of pay in
just about any field.
	2.  Look for statistic pages that list the
number of click throughs, sales, and earnings so
you'll be able to see how you are doing.  
	3.  Always look for programs that offer a 
wide variety of tools to put on your web site, 
including banners, text links, and of course graphics.
	4.  Find out hwo often you'll be paid and 
be sure that the payment schedule meets with your
own expectations.  Some programs will pay monthly,
while others will pay quarterly.
	5.  Be sure that top level support is 
included.  If they can't answer your questions in
a quick and timely manner, you don't want to work
with them.

Once you learn what you are doing with affiliate
programs, you can make a lot of money.  If you
are just starting out, you should always use common
sense and not rush into anything.  As you become
more familiar with how things work, you'll be well 
on your way to making a lot of money - and 
enjoying making it.  If you have to work hard, you'll
be glad you did.
