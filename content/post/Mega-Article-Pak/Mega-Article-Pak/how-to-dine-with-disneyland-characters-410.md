How to Dine With Disneyland Characters

If you really want to delight your child – or yourself – 
you should arrange to have a Disneyland Character 
meal. This will allow you and your whole family to 
have quality time with one or more of the 
Disneyland characters. In fact, this is the best 
way to really get to interact with them for any 
length of time.

Start by making a reservation. This can be done 
through the Disneyland Vacation Planning Services 
Department. Reservations can be made up to sixty 
days in advance, so don’t leave this to the last 
minute. Make these reservations while your 
Disneyland vacation is being planned. 

Character breakfasts take place each morning at the 
park. You do not need a reservation for these meals. 
These breakfasts take place in many of the parks 
restaurants, but Goofy’s Kitchen is a great place to 
start. It is located in the Disneyland Hotel, and there 
are dishes to please everyone. Children under three 
years of age get to eat free, which should be 
considered when you are planning the budget for 
your trip. Goofy is always there, with Pluto, but 
other characters come and go all throughout the 
day. You should definitely make reservations for 
Goofy’s kitchen, as it is quite popular, and the wait 
can be very long.

If dining with Princesses is important, than Ariel’s 
Grotto is the place to be. Serving three course meals, 
this is elegant dining that both kids and adults can 
enjoy. Each princess will come spend a little time at 
your table during your meal – one at a time. 
Reservations for Ariel’s Grotto are also recommended. 
This is one place in the park where both alcoholic and 
non-alcoholic drinks are served.

The Storyteller’s Café is another place that is highly 
recommended for Character Meals. Characters are 
only here during breakfast, however. While time is 
not spent at each individual table, the Characters do 
interact with the children as a group. Both buffet and 
menu dining are available, and again, reservations 
are recommended. Lilo and Stitch also have a 
Character Breakfast, as does Minnie Mouse. 
Breakfast with Minnie and Friends is extremely 
popular, so make reservations.

You should definitely include a Character Meal or 
two in your Disneyland Vacation plans. This is 
something that your child will remember forever and 
interacting with the famous Disney characters that 
we all know and love is part of what Disneyland is 
all about! Be sure to make reservations as far in 
advance as possible.
