Pamper Yourself at Disneyland

You may think that Disneyland is only about fun, 
excitement, and activity – but you would be wrong. 
Disneyland is also about relaxation and pampering. 
The pampering you receive at Disneyland may not 
be the same that you would receive at a world class 
spa, but it is relaxing and makes you feel special 
just the same.

The easiest way to get pampered on your Disneyland 
vacation is to book your room at one of the 
Disneyland resorts, and upgrading your room to one 
that includes Concierge services. The difference in 
the price may startle you a bit, with rooms costing 
up to $300 per night, but the service you receive will 
be out of this world.

First, your room will be much nicer if you have the 
Concierge service. You will have free bottles of water, 
soft drinks, coffee, and tea at all times. You will be 
able to check in and out faster at the Concierge 
check in counter, and a nightly turndown service is 
included. 

Access to the Concierge lounge is where the 
pampering really starts! You will enjoy a continental 
breakfast in the lounge each morning. You can also 
opt to take your breakfast back to your room. In the 
afternoon, while the kids watch Disney Videos, you 
will enjoy a wine tasting in the lounge as well. 

There are many more perks available with the 
Concierge service, differing at each resort. To 
determine whether the Concierge service will benefit 
you and your family, call the resort that you are 
considering, and simply ask what perks are included 
with this service. Ask to be connected with the 
concierge desk to ensure that you are getting 
accurate information.

Again, the cost of this upgrade is a bit high, but 
when you close your eyes and dream of all of the 
pampering and special treatment that you and your 
family will enjoy, and you tally up the cost of the free 
breakfast and drinks, you may find that the cost is 
well worth it. In fact, depending on the size of your 
family, you may even discover that the value of the 
free breakfast and the free drinks even makes the 
entire Disneyland trip a little less expensive for you!

Once you’ve experienced the Concierge Service on 
a trip to Disneyland, you may not be satisfied with 
anything less on future Disneyland trips. The 
service is out of this world, and can only serve to 
make your trip more relaxing and enjoyable.
