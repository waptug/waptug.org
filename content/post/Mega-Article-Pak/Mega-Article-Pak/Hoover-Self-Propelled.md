Hoover Self Propelled

One of the most important things for asthma sufferers
to do to limit the exposure to triggers is to simply
eliminate them.  High quality vacuum cleaners with
the HEPA filtration system will help to remove many
triggers such as dust mites, pet dander, pollen,
and get things really clean.  The Hoover Self
Propelled Wind Tunnel Ultra is more than up to this
task.

The Wind Tunnel upright has many special features
that make it easy to use.  It is self propelled,
which is great, as it is a larger vacuum.  With
its size, the self propelled feature is great to
have.  You simply let the vacuum pull itself around
the floor, sucking up dirt and debris as it goes.

The embedded dirt finder of the Hoover Wind Tunnel
will help you to remember to slow down when you
vacuum, and it actually lets you know when they
are clean, which is great for those who have a
knack for going to fast and missing things. 

Attachments
Unlike other types of vacuum cleaners, the Wind
Tunnel Ultra offers attachments that are easy to
use and actually work.  To activate any of the
attachments, you simple lock the handle of the 
vacuum in the upright position.  Doing so will
automatically turn the dual agitator brushes off.

The attachment hose is a very flexible, high 
quality extension that doesn't require you to 
connect it to anything for it to be used.  All
you have to do is pull the end of the hose from
the vacuum and begin using it.  Among the 
several attachments you can use are two extension
wands, a crevice tool, upholstery nozzle with 
a rotating brush, and a dusting brush as well.

Ability to clean
The Hoover self propelled Wind Tunnel is superb
on hard floors and carpets.  It features a 
hard wood floor setting that will turn the
agitator brushes off so that it doesn't blow
dirt back while you vacuum.  

It offers plenty of power for hard wood floors,
picking up virtually anything.  Vacuuming
rubs and carpets is a snap as well.  With the
embedded dirt finder and the high level of 
power, cleaning is easy.  Throw in a built
in edge cleaner and you have a nice vacuum.

Filtration system
Several people may be flat out shocked to find
a vacuum in this price range that still uses
bags.  This isn't really a bad feature, especially
for those who suffer from asthma.  Emptying a
bagless vacuum can be very tricky for those
who suffer from asthma as the dust and debris
can quickly end up back into the air that you
breathe.

The Hoover Wind Tunnel uses 3M vacuum bags that
feature full HEPA filtration in a 6 step process
to ensure that dust, pollen, and other triggers
remain in the bag and don't make it back into
your home or into your air.  This vacuum 
cleaner also offers an easy to read indicator
that will let you know when the bag is full.

The bottom line
The Hoover Wind Tunnel is a great vacuum cleaner,
and is one of the best you can buy.  It is a
great choice for removing asthma triggers 
from your carpet and floors as well as bedding
and other furniture.  It is also very easy to
use and has plenty of power to spare.

The embedded dirt finder can be the best friend
of an asthma sufferer very fast.  It the 
features aren't enough to make you a believer,
the vacuum is also rated #1 in several magazines,
which proves hand down that this vacuum is
more than worth the purchase.
