Making Container Candles

Container candles are a beautiful way to accent your home, especially the bathroom. To make your container candles look the best, choose glassware that is sturdy and has a simple design. You can purchase this glassware for a very low price at most retail stores. You can generally find great deals at yard sales, flea markets, and thrift sales as well. Try to find glassware with lids if available. 

Clean all the glass prior to using them to prevent dust or other particles from building up inside. If you have a dishwasher a quick rinse cycle will do the trick. It is not recommended to make container candles in anything other than glass containers for safety reasons. 

You will need to obtain a few supplies in addition to your glassware before you can start the process of making container candles. You will need a double boiler for the wax, quality wax, dye, and fragrances if you desire to use it. It is best to get wicks with tabs for making this type of candle. For container candles, you can use either paraffin wax or bees wax. Melt the wax in the double boiler to a temperature of about 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Once it has reached that temperature, add your color and scent.

For best results, microwave the glass containers for a minute or two. This will make sure the wax doesn’t leave unsightly air pockets in the container as it hardens. Place the glass containers on a cookie sheet to make clean up from any spills a snap. Fill each glass container within one inch of the top. Leaving that extra space will allow room for the candle to burn and not drip outside the container. You will need to let your container candles cool for about 20 minutes. 

Gently place a wick with tab into each candle container. You will need to keep an eye on them as you will need to make sure the wick stays centered as the wax hardens. Once the candles completely cool, cut the wick to ½ of the top of the candle. A great way to make working with the wicks easier is to take a ball point pen apart. Place the shell of the pen around the wick and use it to guide the wick into place. As the wax hardens the wick tab with stay firmly in place. You can also clip the top of the wick with a cloths pin laid across the opening to help keep it in place.

You can add creativity to your container candles by decorating the jars with paints or gluing on colored sequences. Glitter makes a great design tool as well. For a simple yet attractive design, consider gluing a pretty colored ribbon around the top of the container. 
The design of container candles allow them to burn down to almost nothing, ensuring you get the most use out of each candle.
