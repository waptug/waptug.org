Formula D Fans:  Support Your Favorite Driver

Formula D, also commonly referred to as Formula Drift or Formula Drifting, is a popular motor sport that has made its way to the United States. It popularity shifted here all the way from Japan.  Formula D is unlike many other car sports.  Unlike many, where you need to race to the finish, Formula D is different. Formula Drifting involves the use of special cars, most commonly imported rear wheel vehicles.  Drivers are judged on the drifting techniques that they are able to successfully execute with their cars.  Sounds like an interesting sport doesn’t it?

If you are a fan of Formula Drifting do you have a favorite driver?  If you actively follow the sport, there is a good chance that you do.  With a wide variety of different competitors, which include, but are not limited to Calvin Wan, Chris Forsbeg, Rhys Millen, and Tanner Foust, you are sure to have, at least one favorite.  If so, do you advertise the fact that you are a fan?  If not, you should.  Fan support is not only important to any sport, but the players as well. With Formula D, the players are often referred to as drivers.  

When it comes to showing support for your favorite Formula D driver, you have a number of different options.  Many of these options require little or no effort, but once executed they will have a number of benefits.  As previously mentioned, fan support is not only important to Formula Drifting, as a whole, but it is also important to the drivers.  Fan support not only makes an athlete proud, but it also lets them know that they are appreciated. When an athlete knows that they have fans out there that support them and depend on them to succeed, their performance often improves.  

One of the ways that you can go about supporting your favorite Formula D driver is by sporting their gear, if they have any.  Although Formula D is popular in the United States, it is still relatively new. In fact, there are some individuals who aren’t even aware that such as sport exists. For that reason, it may be a little bit difficult to come across merchandise or apparel from your favorite Formula D driver.  Despite the fact that it may be difficult, it is possible. A number of popular drivers, including Rhys Millen, have a few select items available for sale. These items can easily be found online.  

As nice as it is to buy something sporting the car or graphics of your favorite Formula D driver, such as a shirt, you need to showcase it.  If you are planning on attending a Formula D event, you are advised to wear the shirt or other piece of clothing that you purchased.  Doing so will let your driver, as well as other fans know, know where your support is.  In fact, you may even be able to purchase driver merchandise, as well as general Formula D merchandise at a live event.  Honestly, it all depends on the event and the vendors that are present. 

Also, to support your favorite Formula Drifting competitor, you will also want to support the sport as a whole. Without Formula D, you would not even have the opportunity to watch your favorite competitor. For that reason, you are encouraged to show your support for the sport, as well as your favorite driver.  You can easily do this by attending live events or by watching them on television. Each year, the Formula Drift series hits the road.  They regularly make stops in Georgia, California, New Jersey, Washington, and Chicago. You may be able to catch a live event at one of these stops.  On television, these events air on G4TV.  

Now that you know how to go about supporting your favorite Formula D competitor and the benefits of doing so, what are you waiting for?  Don’t be a fan that just sits on the sidelines, get out there and show your support.
