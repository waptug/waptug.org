Rather, it should begin as soon as you book your cruise ship reservation.  

The type of cruise that you will be taking is vital to preparation.  A large number of cruise ships travel on international waters.  In addition to being on international waters, many dock at international ports.  Before begin able to board your ship, you may have to show proper identification. With international cruises, this identification often includes a drivers licenses and a passport.

Last minute passports can be obtained in the event of an emergency, but most require at least a week or more to process.  You will not be automatically granted a passport; instead you are required to apply for one.  Almost all individuals that apply for a passport are granted one, but planning ahead is the best option. If error is made on the information you supplied, you will have enough time to fix it before your cruise ship departs.

If you are covered under a health insurance plan, you are encouraged to bring your health insurance cards.  In the event you fall ill while on vacation, your insurance cards will allow you to obtain the needed medical attention.  

In addition to your medical insurance cards, it is advised that you bring along all of your needed medications. You may even want to consider brining along extra medication. Many physicians will write extra prescriptions for their patients that are traveling on a cruise ship.  Should your medication become lost or misplaced, the extra prescriptions can be used until you return home.  While requesting extra medication from your healthcare provider, you may want to question them on safety precautions aboard a cruise ship.

To pay for onboard and port activities, you will need to bring along extra money.  Vacationing aboard a cruise ship is similar to vacationing anywhere else in the world.  You are encouraged not to carry large sums of cash with you.  If you must bring cash along, you are encouraged to divide your money up and place it in safe locations.  Almost all cruise ships and popular cruise ship ports accept credit cards, cashiers checks, money orders, or traveler’s checks.  These forms of payments are great alternatives to carrying cash.

When traveling aboard a cruise ship, you are urged to give a copy of the cruise ship’s itinerary to multiple friends and family members.  This will make it possible for you to be contacted in the event of an emergency.  When registering for a cruise ship, you may also be required to give the contact information of someone that should be contacted in an emergency.  Your first thought may be to give the contact information of your spouse, children, or a close friend.  When doing so, it is important to make sure that they will be on land and accessible.  

Once you have made the above mentioned preparations, you can begin focusing on other preparations, such as packing your luggage.  When packing, you are urged to keep the climate of your cruise in mind.  At the same time, you should be prepared for unexpected weather. Making the proper cruise ship preparations will ensure that your vacation will be a success.
