Carpet Cleaning Tips

Tip 1
Make sure that you get a deep cleaning of the carpet
as often as it is needed.  To achieve a clean carpet,
you'll need to have it cleaned by a professional or
you'll need to use a deep cleaning machine.  There 
are advantages and disadvantages to this method,
although a thorough cleaning is needed every six
months or so.

Tip 2
Keep your eye out for spills and take care of them
in a quick manner to keep your carpet clean.  Simply
using water on a spill will help most of them.  If
that doesn't work, simply expand your search.  You'll
find several products out there on the market that
can help you get rid of spills quick.

The products range in use and can be helpful when
matching them with the different types of spills.  
You can also use a mixture of water and vinegar to
help you keep stains out.  By taking immediate action
you can prevent spills from becoming stains that
leave you with a dirty and messy carpet.

Tip 3
A clean carpet is a carpet that has been taken care
of very well.  You should always take the time to
vacuum your carpet often and make sure you do a good
job.  This means going over the floor in several
directions to allow the vaccum time to pick up all
it can.  High quality vacuums are the best choice,
as they get up the most debris.

Tip 4
The proper use of entrance will greatly help to
clean off people's shoes and keep most of the 
tracked soils off the surface of the carpet.  You
should always use entrance mats outside of your
doors and make sure that anyone who enters your
home use the mats to help get debris and dirt off
of their shoes before they enter.  You can also
take off your shoes and request that guests do the
same, prior to entering your home.

Around 80% of the soils that enter a building or
home are dry.  The remaining 20% are greases, oils,
and starches.  The dry soil types are easily 
removed by vacuuming.  As long as they are removed
on a daily basis, it will help to minimize the
damage to the carpet.

Maintaining and keeping a clean carpet is more than
just healthy, as it can also help to prolong the
life of the carpet.  If you have just laid the
carpet, you are already aware of the expenses 
involved with doing so.

Even if you haven't had this done, you probably 
know the benefits of keeping a clean carpet.  A
clean carpet will add value to the home if it is
maintained well.  It will also help to keep the 
home free from odors as well.  Also, it will help
to make a comfortable living area for your friends
and your family.
