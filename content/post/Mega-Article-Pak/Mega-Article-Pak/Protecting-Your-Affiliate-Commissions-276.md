Protecting Your Affiliate Commissions

There are numerous software products on the market
that range from 15 - 50 dollars for special types
of software that'll assist you in protecting your
affiliate marketing commissions.  The effectiveness
and ease of use for the programs range greatly, so
before you buy one, you should always learn as 
much as you possibly can.

Banner servers
Banner servers not only serve banners, as many of
the more recent servers will also display text
links as well.  The link coding that's associated 
with served ads is normally long, so that the
visitor won't be able to see on the status bar
where the redirect is heading.

Click tracking software
Click counting software will not show the target
URL as the links point inwards to the software,
which is normally installed on your own website.

Once someone has clicked on the link, the click
tracking application will then redirect the 
visitor to the URL that you have specified within
the script.  The click tracking software will also
provide a great way to monitor the usefulness of
your ads and not just relying on the reports 
that merchants will provide.

Protecting your commissions is extremely important,
as you want to get paid for what you do.  Even
though fraud is possible with affiliate marketing,
you can protect yourself.  Fraudsters have certain
techniques and tactics they use, which you can
protect yourself from.

If you own your own business, the last thing you
want to experience is either credit card fraud or
affiliate fraud.  They do happen on a regular
basis, simply because those who have it happen
haven't taken the necessary steps they should 
have to protect themselves.
