Southern Utah Snowmobiling Resorts

Utah is one of the best places for vacationing snowmobilers to enjoy their winter vacations. Nestled in the heart of what is commonly referred to as “color country,” vacationers at one of the many area resorts have access to glorious views of the surrounding Zion National Park, the Cedar Breaks National Monument, the Dixie National Forest, and the Bryce Canyon National Park. With the constant covering of snow, the trees provide a landscape of spectacular scenery for both snowmobilers and vacationers who prefer to relax in the comfort of their resort.

The Pinewoods Lodge Suites is one of the premier resorts in the southern Utah region where winter vacationers can take advantage of the many amenities available for an enjoyable experience. The rooms in this resort include two bedrooms with queen size beds along with a living room. Families and couples will enjoy the opportunity to relax here with a recreation room, fireplace, and a hot tub for unwinding during the evening after a long day of snowmobiling in the frigid winter cold. A fully-furnished kitchen is also included complete with dishes, utensils, toaster, microwave, and coffee maker so guests can relax in the comfort of their suite without needing to travel into town all the time. Families and friends will also appreciate the cable television provided for the guests.

The Mountain Home resort in southern Utah is a three-story home with five private bedrooms that can be rented out as single units or a group can rent the entire house. The common area of the house includes a television so guests can congregate to enjoy their favorite program and mingle with each other. For groups who rent out the entire house, there is a fully-equipped kitchen with dishes, utensils, an oven, and other small appliances for the convenience of the guests. Three wood burning stoves also add to the rustic yet comfortable nature of the Mountain Home resort. The Inn and the Family Suite are other southern Utah resorts that provide similar amenities and are ideal for families, couples, or groups who want access to the plethora of snowmobiling opportunities during the day and resort-style living during the evening. 

The southern Utah resorts offer a variety of options for winter vacationers and guests. To lessen the hassle of transporting or shipping personal equipment and snowmobiles to the resort, guests can rent these for a nominal fee. This also gives vacationers the advantage of riding the newest and latest technology available in the snowmobile market along with safety equipment such as helmets and snowsuits. Patrons can also take advantage of the many guided snowmobiling tours where experienced guides will lead them on customized tours on the circuitous trails through the spectacular trees and scenery of the surrounding Utah national parks. Several resorts offer discount vacation packages if visitors choose to utilize the available resorts along with the snowmobiling activities that are afforded to them. 

With the popularity of snowmobiling rising, resorts have made provisions to accommodate the growing need.
