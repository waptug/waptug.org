audio layer 2 digital encoding to give your videos
the sound quality of CDs at a much lower bitrate.
	4.  HDV uses the same tapes that are already
popular for DV recording, with the recording time
being the same as well.

is used in digital broadcasts and also DVDs.

with NTSC.  HDV also includes CD quality sound, 
MPEG 2 compression, real time encoding, and so much
