Improving Your Security And Privacy

Due to the increase in door-to-door salesman, criminals looking to scope out your residence, and other annoyances, you may sometimes feel that answering your door isn’t worth it.  When you do finally answer your door and find a door-to-door salesman, you may have a very tough time getting rid of them.  They will continue to hassle you and keep coming back until you support their group or buy one of their “innovative” products.

To prevent this from happening and keep unwanted company from bothering you, you should use a protective barrier between your door and the street.  You don’t really need a 15 foot high electric fence, as even the most basic of fencing will do the trick.  You can install a simple decorative fence around your yard, complete with locking gate, to keep any type of solicitors at bay.

Although a fence is a great way to achieve privacy, not everyone has a yard that they can build a fence on.  You can also use a gate that blocks entry to your porch or front door, as this way you can keep the gate locked at all times.  The main idea and theory here is to make it difficult to approach the door to your home.  This way, salesman, solicitors, and even snoops will see that it requires a lot of effort to reach you - and they will normally just give up and move on.

Even though a fence or locked gate are great, you can’t overlook a dog either.  A barking dog can be very effective, as trespassers simply can’ t look over a dog that is barking.  Barking dogs aren’t the same as a fence or gate, although they are very common these days.  Keep in mind however, that the effectiveness of a dog with scaring off unwanted guests will greatly depend on the disposition and character of the dog you have.

Nearly every dog will bark when it sees a stranger, although not every dog will prevent someone from coming to your door unless it has been trained to do so.  A lot of door-to-door salesman and snoops deal with dogs on a daily basis, and will normally just ignore the dog and the barking and proceed to come to your door.  If the dog is more of a violent nature and appears ready to strike, then it will be a different store.  If the salesman or snoop notices the dog is ready to bite, he will normally stop in his tracks and turn around - out of the fear of getting bit.

Keep in mind that having a dog doesn’t mean that you have to blood train him or put him on steroids to keep unwanted visitors away.  What you need, is an aggressive dog that will stand his ground and help you keep your privacy.  When a solicitor visits your home and sees your aggressive dog, he won’t want to sacrifice a sale at the risk of getting bit by your dog.

As annoying as door-to-door solicitors are, there are ways that you can improve your security and your privacy around your home.  You can also invest in home surveillance systems as well, to further enhance your privacy and security.  For solicitors, fencing with a locked gate is the best way to go, if you have the room for it.  On the other hand, if you don’t have the space for a fence, you can always use a dog or other options. Privacy and security is very important - which is why you don’t want solicitors invading your space.
