All About Padlocks

We all remember the days of the padlock.  When they were first available, they presented a great way to keep your belongings safe.  They were common with lockers at school, with just about every locker having one.  Padlocks were easy to open as well; all you needed was the combination.  Once you had the combination, all it took was three clockwise turns, two counterclockwise, and once last clockwise turn to hit the final number and open the padlock.

Although the combination padlock was popular for it’s time, people soon began to realize what happened when they forgot the combination. Combination padlocks were great for those who had a sharp memory although sooner or later forgetting the combination was bound to happen.  Once the combination had been lost, a pair of bolt cutters would be required in order to cut the lock.

Shortly after the combination padlock came the padlocks of today – lock and key.  Padlocks that required a key were much easier to use, requiring no combination.  All you had to do was keep the key with you at all times and you had no worries about the padlock.  If you ended up losing the key however, you would need to cut the lock.  To prevent losing the key, most people chose to put the padlock key on their key ring or wear it on a necklace around their neck.

The most popular type of padlock today is Master Lock.  The Master Lock brand has been around for generations, proving to be the hardest type of lock to break.  It’s been well proven and well documented that guns can’t harm Master Locks.  Even if you shoot the lock dead on with a shotgun or handgun, the lock won’t give.  Master Locks are made of solid high grade steel and won’t give way to a few shots from a gun.  Although they may sustain damage from the blast, they will still be there once the shooting has stopped – protecting what you have them locked to.

Although Master Locks are the most popular and most common type of padlock, there are other types available as well.  Multi-Lock, Medeco, and KW are all excellent examples of quality padlocks.  These locks feature unique and innovative designs that are near impossible for thieves to get rid of.  You can use them around the house to keep doors locked, safes locked, cabinets locked, and virtually anything else that contains your possessions.

The best thing about padlocks is the fact that they are very affordable.  You can find them in virtually any department or hardware store.  You can shop online as well, and compare what each company lock will offer you.  The next time you need to lock up something and you need a small lock – you can count on one of the many padlocks to give you the protection and safety you need.
