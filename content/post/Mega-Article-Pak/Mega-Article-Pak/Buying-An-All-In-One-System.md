Buying An All In One System

These days, more and more people are turning away
from memberships to gyms and instead choosing to 
invest money in a home gym.  You can put a home
gym in a spare corner of your home, or even in the
basement if you wish.  Along with helping you save
money by combining several different types of 
equipment into one machine, these types of equipment
can easily fit in small spaces and type up a lot
less weight than their individual counterparts.

When you are considering to buy an all in one piece
of exercise equipment, you should first think 
about your goals.  You should consider what you 
hope to achieve from exercising and just how well
this piece of equipment will benefit you.

There are several types of all in one equipment for
exercise on the market and almost all of them are
advertised well on television, in magazines, and 
on the internet.  The most popular types on the
market are those types that are geared towards
individuals who are interested in lifting weights.

Right now, the two most popular types of all in
one exercise systems are the Bowflex and Total Gym
brands.  The Bowflex system uses resistant bows 
that bend instead of the traditional weights that
simply lift.  Bowflex is designed to fit a wide
variety of budgets and needs, it's widely 
adaptable and extremely popular as well.

To make things even better, you can store the
basic Bowflex system in small and tight places,
even under a bed if you choose.  The larger and
more expensive Blowflex system competes with 
the types of professional equipment that you can
find in gyms, which allow you a quality workout
on quality equipment.

The Total Gym system is great as well, as it
is advertised by martial arts legend Chuck Norris
and supermodel Christie Brinkley.  It is less
expensive than the Bowflex and uses gravity
and resistance instead of traditional weights.
By using this system, you have the ability to
adapt the machine to a wide variety of exercises
that will work many different areas of your body.

When you make that decision about buying an all
in one exercise system, you must also decide 
on price, features, brand, and just who will use
the machine.  If your family plans to use it as
well, then you'll need to get a system that 
everyone will agree on.  You obviously wouldn't
want a machine that is too complicated for
others in your home.

Even though Bowflex and Total Gym are the 2 most
popular types of all in one equipment, there are
several others out there as will, from brands
such as Weider and many others.  Before you
make your choice, you should look at several
to see which one offers you more for your money.
