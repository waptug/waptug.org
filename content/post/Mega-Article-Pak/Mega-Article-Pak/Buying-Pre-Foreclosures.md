Buying Pre Foreclosures

Pre foreclosures are known as properties that have reached the final stages before they get repossessed or taken back by the lender or bank.  The owner is still in complete control of the property or home, although the bank or lender will repossess the home if the owner doesn’t attempt to rectify the situation.  Normally, if the owner makes things right with payment, the pre foreclosure will settle and things will go back to normal.
