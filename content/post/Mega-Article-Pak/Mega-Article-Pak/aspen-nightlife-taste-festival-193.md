Aspen Nightlife – Taste Festival

Winter time isn’t the only time to visit Aspen. 
There is a great deal going on each summer, 
and one of the highlights each June is the 
Taste Festival. This is also called the Food & 
Wine Magazine Classic, and people from all 
over the world arrive in droves for this three 
day event. 

Cookbook authors, wine experts, restaurateurs, 
and famous chefs can all be found here. 
Wolfgang Puck, Jacques Pepin, and Andrea 
Immer have all attended the Taste Fest in 
Aspen – because if food is your life, this is the 
place to be! Each year, there are over eighty 
cooking and food demonstrations, and visitors 
can get a taste of it all. 

There are many seminars and wine tasting 
sessions held throughout Aspen during these 
three days as well. If you want to attend this 
incredible mouth watering event, make your 
reservations months in advance – or you will 
miss out! If you don’t make your reservations 
early, try to find a hotel with space available in 
a nearby town, and drive back and forth to the 
event – check the local camp grounds as well. 
Just make sure you don’t miss this event!
