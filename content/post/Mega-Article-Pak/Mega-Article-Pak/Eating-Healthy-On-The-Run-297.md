Eating Healthy On The Run

Whether your traveling on the go or around the 
home, you don't need to give up healthy eating 
simply because you are on the run.  The fact is, 
healthy eating is even more important when your 
trying to keep up with a busy schedule.

Having a good diet will help your body to handle
stress better.  As you hustle about, a healthy meal
is probably the last thing you think about.  The
following tips can help you eat when your on the go.

Restaurants
With tempting menus, large portions, and a festive
atmosphere, it's easy to skip healthy eating.  It's
okay to splurge every now and then, although you'll
pack on a lot of weight if you make it a habit.  
When you eat out at restaurants, always be smart 
about it.

Airports
An airport can be a very stressful place, although
you shouldn't scrap your diet because of it.  Eat
because you are hungry, not because of stress, 
boredom, or to kill time.

In your car
Keep some healthy snacks in your car at all times, 
so that when you get hungry - you have them.

At home 
Evenings and mornings are busy times in most homes.
Making the time to eat can be hard, although you
shouldn't run out the door without eating breakfast
first.  Cereal with milk, a banana, muffin, or even 
a bagel is a great way to start the day.

Anytime you are on the go, always make sure that you
make the right food decisions.  You can take healthy
food with you if you need to, so that you have it
when you need it.  Eating healthy on the go is easy
to do, once you know how.  Never sacrifice healthy
food for junk, as your body will regret it later.
