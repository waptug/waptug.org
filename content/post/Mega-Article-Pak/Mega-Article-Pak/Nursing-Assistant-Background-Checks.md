Nursing Assistant Background Checks

In today’s society, background checks are conducted by most employers to help safeguard against theft as well as to help secure the safety of the people they serve and the other staff members. Anyone wanting to be a Nursing Assistant should expect a very thorough background check to be conducted prior to being hired at any medical facility. In many instances, a background check will have to be completed prior to acceptance in a Nursing Assistance program. It generally depends on the state requirements.

The level of clearance you must pass on a background check varies by agency and state. In some states, only crimes involving violence will ban you from employment as a Nursing Assistant. In others, any felony will result in not being hired. There are a few states that push it even further. If you have any history of domestic violence, harassment, drunk driving, misdemeanors, or felonies, you can’t work in the medical profession.
While some may think this is extreme, statistics show theft and abuse committed by Nursing Assistants is done by those who have some criminal record prior to being hired by the agency where the abuse or theft took place.

If you are not familiar with a background check, it can include many things. Some employers simply check your criminal history. Others go to great lengths to find out information about you. They will check the education information on your resume, verify all past employment, and call all your references. There are a select few employers who will conduct a credit rating as well. This is because up to 40% of all resumes given to employers contain some kind of false information. 

Investigating a person’s motor vehicle record has also become popular. The one area that an employer can’t look into is your medical history. However, many medical facilities require Nursing Assistants to pass a physical exam prior to hiring. 

An employer will need to discuss the types of background checks they will conduct prior to doing so. Often, you will need to sign consent from allowing them to obtain such information. In most cases, an employer will not be conducting a background check unless they are ready to offer you the job. It is not uncommon for them to offer the position, but clarify that it is contingent on the background check coming back clear. 

This being told, Nursing Assistants need to be up front about their background. While it is difficult to secure employment in the field with a criminal history, it is possible depending on the circumstances. If you lie about your work experience, it is quite possible you will get caught. Since the demand is so high for Nursing Assistants, you can still get the job if you don’t have much work experience. Employers are often looking for someone who is honest and willing to work. Show them both, and they will offer to train you.

If your background check comes back with information that negatively reflects your chances of being hired, the company has to provide you with the information they received as well as the name of the company they obtained the information from. If they information is incorrect, it is very important that you contact your local agency relating to the reported information. In addition, remember that getting into trouble with the law, the Department of Motor Vehicles, or financially might result in you losing your position as a Nursing Assistant. You will want to review the policies for the agency you are accepting employment with.
