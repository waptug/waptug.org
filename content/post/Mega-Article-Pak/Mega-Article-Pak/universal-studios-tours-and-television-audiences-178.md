Universal Studios Tours and Television Audiences

Have you ever dreamed of sitting in the audience of 
your favorite television shows? Now you can – at 
the Universal Studios Tours TV Audience Booth. 
This could be the opportunity of a lifetime, but you 
need to move fast.

Make your way to the TV Audience Booth inside 
the park. Find out what shows are filming on that 
particular day, or for other days when you will be at 
the park. The tickets are free, but there is limited 
availability, and not all shows will be filming 
everyday. You can often find out the filming 
schedule for shows by calling ahead. With that 
schedule, you can plan your trip to coincide with 
the filming of your favorite shows.

What better way to spend part of your Universal 
Studios Tour vacation? You can see what is going 
to happen on your favorite television shows well in 
advance. You can even make a game of it! Don’t 
tell you friends that you were in the audience, and 
place bets as to what is going to happen later in 
the series!
