Upgradeable Surround Sound

There are many great and not so great surround sound and home theater systems on the market today. With so many from which to choose how on earth do you know what to look for in order to get your money's worth? The answer to that just might be easier than you have imagined. The thing to remember when it comes to technology is that it is constantly evolving. This means that it is in your best interest to find a surround sound or home theater system that is upgradeable. 

In fact, I would say that this alone would be my number one requirement when purchasing a home theater or surround sound system in today's market. If you purchase an AV receiver that has room to expand as technology for sound advances then you have the foundation for building an even better system over time. If you can find a good deal on an AV receiver that is also THX certified then you are setting the stage for an outstanding system once you have everything in place.

While speakers are extremely important you can buy the 5 speakers plus subwoofer that you will need for a 5.1 channel surround sound system at a reasonable price and make plans to purchase better speakers in time. You want to make certain that the speakers you buy are some that you can definitely live with as you save for even better speakers in the future but buying a set for now that has a decent quality of sound rather than stretching your budget for those that are better means that you can save your money and in time buy an even better set of speakers for your surround sound system or home theater.

The really good news is the speakers you like today that are just out of your price range will be priced lower this time next year. Of course, there will be even better speakers on the market by that time. If you save your money over the course of the next year in a year you can upgrade to a far superior system even while you've been enjoying the system you currently own the entire time. Imagine how much more pleasure you will receive from your investment once you've made an upgrade?

Another great thing to think about when it comes to upgrades is that they are not an all or nothing proposition. You can upgrade one piece at a time and never have to go without in order to achieve excellent sound quality that simply keeps getting better. While I know on one hand that sacrifice is good for the soul I'm never too thrilled about giving up things that bring me pleasure in order to get better things later. Doing things this way I get to have great sound while I'm saving for even better sound in the future. It's like having your caking and your neighbors cake too!

As you wander through the aisles of your local electronics store and check out all the options that are available be sure to take the time to look at things you will wish to make plans for in the future. Be sure that the components you buy today are in line with the things you'd like to add to your surround sound system in the future and don't lose sight of the ultimate goal by overspending on a starter set.
