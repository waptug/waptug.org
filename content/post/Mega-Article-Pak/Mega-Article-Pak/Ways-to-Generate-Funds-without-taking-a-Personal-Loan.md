Ways to Generate Funds without taking a Personal Loan

Obtaining a personal loan can be great, but don’t forget that monthly payment that goes with it. If you are uncertain if you can meet the monthly obligation of a personal loan, don’t take the risk. This is especially important if the only type of personal loan you are eligible for is one that is secured. A secured personal loan means that you have collateral attached to it. There are other ways to generate funds without taking out a personal loan. It will depend on the amount of money you need. If nothing else, you may be able to come up with a portion of the money, reducing the amount you need to borrow. 

One of the easiest is to borrow from a friend or family member. However, only do so if they are understanding of your situation. If you will have a hard time repaying such a loan then you don’t want the relationship to suffer. Parents are sometimes willing to extend a loan with terms that are loose depending on the child’s needs and the parent’s disposable income.

Consider selling things you already own to generate funds. This can be vehicles, property, and art work, anything you have of value. You can also consider having a yard sale to earn some extra money. Every little bit you can generate will help you to avoid taking out a personal loan. Old books, especially college books and CD’s sell well on the online auction sites such as Ebay and Yahoo Auctions.

Depending on your schedule, it may be possible for you to obtain some type of work as another income source. You can do this temporarily until you have saved up the funds you are needed. This can be working on the weekends or evenings at a retail or convenience store. You may even try your hand at telemarketing. If you are going to college consider tutoring or typing papers.

The internet offers many employment opportunities that you can do from your home. There are sites that allow you to make money by typing papers, conducting research, proofreading, and even transcribing. You can do as little or as much work as you are interested in. The pay is very good as well. However, there are some work from home scams out there. Don’t sign up for any such program that requires you to send them money or purchase a start up kit. 

For those of you who interact with many people socially, selling Avon or Mary Kay products can be a very easy way to generate income. You simply leave books with interested people and place their order for them. Both can be very profitable. 

For most of us, simply cutting our expenses can generate a considerable amount on money on a regular basis. Consider switching to store brand soaps and shampoos rather than name brands. Clip coupons and watch for store sales. Make a menu and stick to it. Only purchase the items on your grocery list. Carpool to work to cut down on the expense of gas and vehicle maintenance. Make your coffee and lunch at home rather than purchasing it. Eat your dinner at home rather than eating out. If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit. You will be amazed at the amount of money you are able to save when you no longer purchase such products. 

Applying of credit should be done so wisely. Rather than rushing out to apply for a personal loan, consider ways you can generate more income to cover the expense on your own. It won’t always be easy, but you will feel better knowing you accomplished the feat on your own. You will also avoid another monthly payment that can lead you to financial stress.
