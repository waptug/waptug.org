Styles Of Blinds Shutters

The best parts of decorating your windows are the 
different window treatments you can choose.  This 
is where you can make decisions on fabrics, colors,
and also styles.  Each decision you make between
contrasting borders, cording or fringe will show off
your own individually.  If you add repeating 
fabrics and colors in other parts of the room you
could help to add a dash of flair to your home.

You also have different styles of draperies and 
valances to choose from.  With draperies, you have
the options of rods with tap tops, tie tops with
different pleats, grommet rod pockets, flouncy tops
or plain rings.  With valances you can choose to 
have them gathered, pleated, shirred, swaged, 
bundled, formal, casual, scalloped, lace, or even
flat.

You also have a different variety of shades and
blinds to choose from.  You can choose between
fabric shades or cellular shades.  If you don't want
to go with shades, you can choose from metal mini
blinds, natural blinds, or even wood blinds.

With fabric shades you can choose between the Roman,
balloon, Austrian, bottom arched, pleated, or even
flat panel.  If you prefer cellular shades, keep 
in mind that they will give you a cleaner look
and are also available in sheer or non-sheer
materials.

If you decide to choose blinds, make sure that
they meet your homes requirements.  Metal mini blinds
offer choices in weight and size, special finishes,
privacy options, header choices, cloth tapes, and
hundreds of different colors.

Wooden mini blinds also offer a variety of sizes,
tape colors, and finishes.  Natural blinds are also
known as bamboo blinds, and are available in 
matchstick, sewn slats, and have several choices
of natural fabric like appearance.
