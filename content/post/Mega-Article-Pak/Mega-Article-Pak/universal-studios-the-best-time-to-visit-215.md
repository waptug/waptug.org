Universal Studios Tours – The Best Time To Visit

As with all theme parks, there is a good time and a 
bad time to visit the Universal Studios Tours theme 
park. You should strive to visit at a time when the 
park is less crowded to get the most out of the tour 
and the park.

Weekends and school holidays should be avoided. 
Most of the visitors at these times are local people 
who live in the area, and it becomes very crowded, 
with very long lines. The park is closed on 
Thanksgiving and Christmas, so don’t plan a visit 
during those times.

Visit the Universal Studios website to find out which 
movies are in production, or which movies will be in 
production at the time of your visit. This may play in 
the decision as to when to visit. If you visit during 
the time of a movie production, you are likely to see 
the movie set, and you may even get the opportunity 
to see the stars in action!

When you do visit, plan to arrive well before the 
gates open. You should arrive at least thirty minutes 
in advance. You should buy your tickets in advance 
for added convenience. This can be done through a 
travel agent, over the phone, or online. Tickets can 
even be printed out using your printer.
