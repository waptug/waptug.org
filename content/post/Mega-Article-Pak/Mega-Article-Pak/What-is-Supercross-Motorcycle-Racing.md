What is Supercross Motorcycle Racing?

Have you heard of supercross motorcycle racing before?  Supercross motorcycle racing is a sport that is popular in America.  However, despite that popularity, there are still many individuals who have no idea what supercross is. If you are one of those individuals, you are urged to learn about this sport.  It is so fun, exciting, and action packed that there is a good chance that you will be a supercross motorcycle fan, in no time at all.

If you enjoy watching professional racing, especially NASCAR, there is a good chance that you will also enjoy supercross motorcycle racing. This is because, like most other forms of racing, supercross is an action packed, competitive sport.  If you are watching a supercross race, whether that race is live or televised, you will likely be on the edge of your seat.    

Although supercross was earlier compared to NASCAR, you will find that the two actually have little in common, besides the fact that they are both popular and both are focused on racing.  While NASCAR uses traditional race cars, also sometimes referred to as sports cars, supercross uses motorcycles. What is unique about these motorcycles is that they are not the ones that you regularly see on the highway; they are off-road bikes made especially for off-road racing.  

In addition to using off-road motorcycles, supercross varies from a number of other forms of racing, especially when it comes to the racing surface.  Like many other forms of racing, including asphalt racing or traditional dirt track racing, you will find that supercross racing events take place on man-made tracks. These man-made tracks are often indoors.  The tracks will vary, depending on the type of supercross race, but most tracks have numerous obstacles, which include jumps.  The goal of supercross is to maneuver your motorcycle throughout the track to finish first.

As previously mentioned, the type of man-made track will all depend on the type of supercross race being run.  Supercross is a professional racing sport, but it is not just limited to professional racing.  Men, women, and children from all across the United States have started taking part in this fun and exciting sport.  Those riders are often referred to as amateur supercross racers.  Amateur supercross racers may race at a local track.  In fact, many local individuals and business owners have come together to sponsor local supercross drivers, as well as provide funding for the tracks. Although these events may not be considered professional, they are rapidly increasing in popularity.  In fact, they are so popular that you may even have a local supercross or motocross track in or around your neighborhood.

In addition to local supercross tracks, there are many individuals who have made their own. Although most professional supercross racing tracks are indoor tracks, most amateurs have or use ones that are outdoors. A large number of want-to-be professional riders have made the decision to develop a track in their own backyard or in nearby fields.  However, the only downside to doing this is that racers are often on their own.  In the event that an accident occurs, it may be more difficult to obtain help, when compared to racing at professional tracks and sanctioned events.

Now that you know what supercross motorcycle racing is, you may either want to become a fan or a racer. Whichever you wish to be, there is a good chance that you will be enjoying the sport of supercross motorcycle racing for years to come.
