When to End Your Email Marketing Campaign

Deciding when to end an email marketing campaign is one subject which many business owners may struggle with on a regular basis. This decision can be difficult both in situations in which the email marketing campaign is enjoying a great deal of success and in situations in which the email marketing campaign is failing. In general business owners will have to evaluate a number of different criteria to make this decision and there is no one specific formula which will work for all business owners. In this article we will examine three different scenarios including a successful email marketing campaign which is approaching a logical conclusion, an email marketing campaign which is failing and a successful email marketing campaign which may be able to run indefinitely.

First we will examine the case of a successful email marketing campaign which is approaching a logical conclusion. In some cases it may be logical for a business owner to conclude his email marketing efforts. The most obvious example is an email marketing campaign which is focused on achieving a specific goal and not selling products or services. For example an email marketing campaign which is political in nature may start off slowly, peak during a time when voters are most interested in obtaining information about the issues and then begin to wane as the voting process begins and the majority of voters have already made their decision. Similarly an email marketing campaign which is focused on collecting donations for a specific charity will logically end as the goal is reached. These email marketing campaigns may be highly successful but there is simply no reason to continue them beyond when the goals is reached. 

Next we will consider the case of an email marketing campaign which is not achieving its goal. Deciding when to end an email marketing campaign of this nature can be difficult because it will involve a number of different factors. For example if the business owner is investing a great deal of time and money into email marketing and not generating results despite an honest effort it may be time to end this marketing campaign. However, if the business owner has not invested a great deal in the email marketing campaign and has a few remaining ideas for turning the campaign into a success, it might be worthwhile to continue the email campaign for a little longer to see if the desired goals can be met. 

Finally, it is important to note that email marketing campaigns do not always have to come to an end. Consider a niche topic such as search engine optimization (SEO). A business owner who has been producing and distributing monthly e-newsletters on this subject and receiving a positive response to these email marketing tools, there is not reason for him to discontinue the email marketing as long as he is still capable of producing the e-newsletters. Similarly to the way many magazines have been in publication for years and years it is possible for an e-newsletter to remain active for as long s there is a need and an interest in the information being provided. In our example of a business owner publishing an SEO newsletter, the need for this product remains because SEO is continually evolving and recipients of the e-newsletter may anticipate receiving the e-newsletter each month to get more information on current trends in the industry.
