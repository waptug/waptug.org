Exercise Back Pain Away

According to past research and studies, nearly 80%
of all Americans will experience some type of back
pain in their lives.  The American Academy of
Orthopedic Surgeons believes this as well, as they
say 80% of us out there will encounter some type of
problem with our back before we die.

Traditionally, the treatment for lower back pain is
increasing core strength to increase flexibility on
muscles that are tight, which will provide better
stabilization of the spine and exercises to correct
the imbalances of the muscles.  The muscles that
surround the spine will provide stability and support
of the spinal column.

Every muscle between the hips and shoulders are 
included as well, as these muscles are referred to
as the core muscles.  Back pain can be a result of
muscle imbalances caused by any of these core
muscles.  If the back of your thighs are weaker than
the front of your thighs, there will be an uneven
pull on the front of your spinal column.  

There are some effective ways that you can integrate
core strength training exercises into all of the
exercises you perform, rather than doing just the
traditional crunches and sit-ups.  One such way
is by breathing effectively.  Deep breathing will
utilize your diaphragm muscles which will help 
support the spinal column and lengthen the spine,
which is great for your lower back and supporting
you when you walk or run.

The tummy tuck and bridge lift can also help you
to reduce back pain and strengthen the core 
muscles as well.  The tummy tuck exercise is a
simple pelvic tilt that draws the abdominal muscles
away from the floor.  Do perform a tummy tuck,
simply lie face down on the floor and squeeze
your glutes to strengthen your spine.

Instead of pressing into your thighs, you should
instead reach your tailbone down towards your
heels.  Perform 15 reps of each exercise and
alternate them until you have completed a couple
of sets.  

For the bridge, place your feet on a bench or
on the floor and scoop your pelvis upward, as your
rib cage should stay low to reduce any irritation
to your spinal muscles.  The bridge will help to
relieve stress on your back and focus the muscle
contractions into the glutes and the hamstrings.

Other exercises for lower back pain are the lumbar
side stretch, hip flexor stretch, and calf
stretches, as all three can help to alleviate
pull on your spinal column.

Hip flexor stretch
When doing a hip flexor stretch, bring one foot
forward in a bent knee, 90 degree angle, while your
other leg is on the floor behind you with your
foot pointed upwards toward the ceiling.  The
hip flexor stretch will help to open up the 
muscles of your back on the side of the spine near
your hips.  You can also squeeze your glutes as 
well to deepen the stretch with each breath you
exhale.  You should begin to feel a stretch in your
back leg, in the thigh front and the hamstrings
on your front leg.

Lumbar side stretch
This stretch will bring your legs wide with your 
knees bent while you sit or stand.  Simply bring
one hand down towards your foot on the inside of 
the thighs and your other hand behind your head.

The last stretch will open up your Achilles tendon,
which is the most distant pull on the spine.  For
this, place an object under your foot and lean the
weight of your body forwards.  Maintain a fluid
breath while you hold stretches for 30 seconds or
so.  After a while, you should begin to feel a 
stretch behind your knee and shin.
