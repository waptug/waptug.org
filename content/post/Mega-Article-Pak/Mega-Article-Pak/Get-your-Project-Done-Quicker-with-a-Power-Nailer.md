Get your Project Done Quicker with a Power Nailer

The days of spending your time hammering long nails to complete your project are over! No more wasted time or sore arms from the repetitive motion. A power nailer will get the job done fast and efficiently. It is a great way to ensure every nail is secure as well as straight. You can sink thousands of nails in a single day with a power nailer. It is great for large projects such as roofing. 

There are two types of power nailers to choose from. A stick power nailer uses a strip of nails that slide into the nailer, just like you load a stapler. The amount of nails it can hold at one time varies. On average, it is approximately 50 nails. This type of power nailer is great for small projects. For larger tasks, consider using a coil power nailer. They hold up to 300 nails at a time. 

It is very important that you use the proper power nailer for your particular project. It is best to select a power nailer that is versatile, unless you have specific ongoing use for a particular type of power nailer. Where you plan to use the power nailer is something to consider as well. Do you have a power source readily available or will you be better off going with a cordless power nailer model? 

Pneumatic power nailers operate with air pressure that is supplied by a small air compressor. If you choose this type of power nailer, make sure you have an air compressor that is sufficient to handle the power of the power tool. You should check the amount of pressure necessary to operate the power nailer before purchasing. 

Since power nailers are often used for roofing and other construction work, you might consider getting a cordless model. They often are just as powerful as the models that operate on compressed air. They come with very effective batteries that are long lasting. Some operate with a compressed gas in a canister. Both types are very effective, so it is a personal preference. It also depends on if you want to hassle with recharging the battery. 

To help you decide on the best model of power nailer for your needs, consider these features. Make sure any power nailer offers you what you will need to complete your particular project. Find out if the power nailer has a jam release. You don’t want to stop working throughout the day to spend time figuring out how to unjam the power nailer. 

You will want a power nailer that offers you an adjustable depth controller. This is because you will want to use it for different length of nails. It will also help you get the nails sunk in even with the surface of the project or even countersink them. 

Since the reasoning behind purchasing a power nailer is to give you the ability to put in large quantities of nails in a short amount of time, it should be easier to control. You want to select a power nailer that fits well in your hands and has a good fit. A heavy power nailer can be difficult to operate for long periods of time. How easy is it to load the nails into the power nailer? You want one that is very efficient. You should be able to reload it, even with work gloves on, in just a few seconds. 


There are many different types of nails you can choose from. For the best results, make sure the nails you are using work well in your model of power nailer as well as for the particular project you are working on. You should always wear protective eye wear and work gloves while operating any type of power nailer. It is a good idea to purchase a power nailer that offers some sort of guard for your protection as well.
