Sending Out Invitations for a New Years Eve Party

If you are planning on hosting a New Years Eve party, one of the first items of business is planning your guest list. Once this is done and you have an idea of how many guests you will have, it is time to select a location for your party. Once you do this you can set a time for the event as well. All of this information is important because you will have to include all of this information on the invitation for your New Years Eve party. For this reason the planning of your New Years Eve party should be well underway before you send out your invitations. You should also consider whether or not there are any special requirements for the party because you might want to include these on the invitation as well. For example if you are planning a black tie event this should be noted on the invitations so guests know how they are expected to dress for the event. Similarly if you plan to make the party a potluck event, this should also be indicated on the invitation so guests will be aware that they are required to bring along a dish to share at the party.

When hosting a New Years Eve party, you should also give some consideration to whether or not you want to have a theme for the party. Although it is not necessary to have the invitations reflect the theme, it is a fun idea and it can help to give the guests an indication of what to expect. Also if you expect guests to dress according to the theme, you will want to let the guests know so they are not caught by surprise.

The timing of sending out New Years Eve party invitations is also very important. New Years Eve is a very popular holiday and many people start making plans for New Years Eve very early. For this reason, you might want to consider sending out invitations rather early to ensure your potential guests do not accept other invitations before they even receive your invitations. It is not unusual for a host to send out New Years Eve invitations as early as October. This helps to ensure the guests will receive the invitations before the holiday season so they can plan appropriately for your party. Alternately a host can send out invitations later in the year but send a save the date notice earlier or contact guests via phone to inform them of your intentions to host a party so they are aware that an invitation is on the way. 

When sending out New Years Eve invitations it is important to include instructions for responding. This is important because it is unlikely all of your invited guests will be able to attend the party but you want to know exactly how many guests will be attending. This number will be important for planning food, beverages and favors. If you do not know the number of guests ahead of time you may not have enough of these items or you may have too much left over. 

Finally, when sending out New Years Eve party invitations, budget is often a very important consideration. Custom invitations can actually be quite expensive. When setting your budget, you should research the cost of invitations and use this information to set your budget for these items.
