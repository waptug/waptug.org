How to Watch a Formula D Racing Event

Formula D Racing; if you are a race fan, there is a good chance that you have heard of it before. Although Formula D is considered to be racing, there is a lot more than racing that is involved.  In fact, drifting is important; thus, the alternative name for Formula D Racing. That alternative name is known as Formula Drifting.  If you are a fan of drifting or if you would like to learn more about the sport, there is a good chance that you would be interested in watching an event.  If this is the case, you have a number of different options.

Perhaps, the best way to watch a Formula D Racing event is live, in person.  Each year, the Formula D Racing series travels to a number of different tracks.  In 2006, these events took place in Long Beach, Atlanta, Chicago, Sonoma, Seattle, Wall, and Irwindale.  As Formula Drifting continues to increase in popularity, there is a good chance that additional locations will be added on to the series.  However, until that time, you may have to have access to one of the previously mentioned cities to watch a live Formula D Racing event.  In the event that you are able to attend a Formula D event, you are advised to.  With most tickets being only around twenty dollars, you will find that it is an affordable and exciting way to spend your day.

As nice as it would be to watch a live Formula D Racing event, you may not have the ability to do so.  As previously mentioned, these races only take place in a few different areas.  Unfortunately, only a select number of states, such as Georgia, California, Washington, Illinois, and New Jersey currently host Formula D events.  Essentially, this means that unless you live in these states, there is a good chance that you would be unable to attend a live event.  However, that does not mean that you cannot enjoy the sport.  It does, however, mean that you will have to find a different way to watch it.  One of those ways involves your television.

A large number of sporting groups, including Formula Drift, have made the decision to partner with a specific television network or a number of them. Formula Drift made the decision to partner with G4TV, otherwise known as G4. This popular television network airs a number of Formula D Racing events, as well as applicable programming.  This means that, in addition to watching coverage of racing events, you can also go behind the scenes at a Formula D Racing event or even in the pits.  Watching Formula D Racing on television may not be as great as seeing it live, in person, but it is just as good. In fact, watching Formula D Racing on television is a nice alternative for those who are unable to travel to live events.

You could also not only watch a Formula D Racing event, but learn more about the sport, by renting or buying movies.  A fairly large number of videos, with a focus on Formula Drifting, have been created.  These videos may include movies on the sport, coverage of past events, or instructional videos on the art of drifting.  If you are unable to attend a live drifting event and you do not have access to G4TV, you will find that these videos are nice to own or even rent.  To purchase or rent these videos, you are encouraged to look online or at your local video rental store.
As you can easily see, there are a number of different ways that you can go about watching programming that is centered on Formula Drifting.  Whether that programming is coverage of a recent event or just information on the sport, you will likely enjoy it.  If you haven’t already figured out, you soon will; Formula Drifting is an action packed sport that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
