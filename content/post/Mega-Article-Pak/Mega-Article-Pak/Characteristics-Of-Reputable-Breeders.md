Characteristics Of Reputable Breeders

When you decide to get a new Golden Retriever puppy, the first choice you will face is where to get your puppy from.  No matter how hard you try, it’s nearly impossible to know whether or not the puppy you are buying will grow up to be healthy and strong.  In order to even assume that your puppy will grow up to be healthy, you’ll need to trust the individual you get your Golden from.

There are three options available to you, in terms of breeders.  You should carefully think about each one, as they all will vary.  Below are the three options you have to choose from, and a little bit of information to help you make this very important decision.

Dealer or pet shop
A pet shop is simply the worst place that you can get your Golden Retriever puppy.  The puppies they have for sale here are bred poorly, and raised in poor locations to say the least.  At these types of places, the puppies are thought of as a profit and nothing more.  There is little to no emphasis on quality here either - as pet shops prefer quantity over qualify.

Due to the way the puppies are bred and raised, pet shops make quite a bit of profit.  With there being so little that goes into the breeding and care of the puppies, pet shops make a lot of money.  They mainly rely on impulse buying, not giving you a lot of time to evaluate the puppies that they have for sale.  If you’re looking for an addition to your family, and a puppy that you know is healthy, you’d be better off looking somewhere else for your puppy.

Backyard breeders
Backyard breeders are considered to be yet another poor choice for your puppy.  Almost all backyard breeders are people who own a few Golden’s and find it to be fun to breed their female for the fact of having puppies, or breed her once or twice before they decide to go ahead and get her spayed.  Backyard breeders don’t look for quality or go out of their way to care for their litters, as they are more or less breeding to make money - and nothing more.

Normally, backyard breeders know very little about the breed in general, and even less about how to properly care for their Golden Retrievers.  Backyard breeders normally aren’t familiar with the problems associated with breeding, and most could care less.  Their only goal here is to breed Golden Retriever puppies.  Once the puppies have been bred, their remaining goal is to sell the puppies as fast as they can - for the highest possible price.

Hobby breeders
A hobby breeder is the ideal way to get your Golden puppy.  Hobby breeders are loyal, committed, and think of their pups as more than just a hobby.  Although they do make money breeding, they could honestly care less.  Hobby breeders care more about the quality of their puppies than anything else, and they commit themselves to helping you get the best Golden Retriever pup possible.

Hobby breeders accept responsibility for each one of their puppies, and they stand behind each and every one of their pups.  If you want the best pup you can get for your money, you need to visit a hobby breeder.  They very rarely produce poor quality Golden Retriever puppies, as they care a lot about quality.  If you get your Golden puppy from a hobby breeder, you can rest assured that you getting a healthy puppy from the start.
