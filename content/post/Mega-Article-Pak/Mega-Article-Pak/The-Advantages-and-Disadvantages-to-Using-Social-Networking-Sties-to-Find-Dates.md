Have you been looking for love, but in all of the wrong places?  Many singles are fed up with the traditional bar scene; therefore, many are looking for alternatives when it comes to meeting and possibly falling in love with someone.

As previously mentioned, online dating websites are the best type of social network to join, especially if you are looking for a romantic partner.  Unfortunately, unlike most traditional networking sites, most dating sites require a paid membership. To many this membership is worth the cost, but overtime it could get quite expensive and you are not guaranteed any results. 

In addition to the cost of dating online, there are a large number of safety concerns that could be considered disadvantages as well.  Unfortunately, the internet has made it easy for individuals to claim to be someone who they are not. Essentially, this means that you could be starting an online relationship with someone who is not as they look in their photos or their personality is not as they described to you.  While this will not only lead to disappointment when you find out, it could also lead to danger.  There have been numerous reports of instances where online dates resulted in abuse or murder; therefore, you are always urged to be careful and meet your dates in a safe, public place.

The above mentioned advantages and disadvantages of social networking dating are just a few of the many.  One you have examined all of these advantages and disadvantages, you can compare the two. If you find that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages then social networking and dating might be right for you.
