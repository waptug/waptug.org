Christmas Shopping for Your Boss

Christmas shopping for your boss can be a difficult situation. First of all purchasing a Christmas gift for your superiors at work is considered to be somewhat of a faux pas unless the gift is being purchased by a group of employees. While giving Christmas gifts to subordinates is generally an accepted practice, gifts from individuals to a boss can be viewed as an attempt to gain advantages such as promotions or favorable projects or treatments. As a result care should always be taken when giving Christmas gifts to a boss. This article will take a look at situations in which giving a Christmas gift to your boss is acceptable and will offer tips for Christmas shopping for your boss.

While an individual giving a Christmas gift to the boss is not an accepted practice it is acceptable for a group of employees to purchase a joint gift for their boss. As an example, a boss who oversees the work of a small group of employees may receive a gift from this small group collectively and this would be considered appropriate. In this way the gift is viewed as a gesture of appreciate from the members of the group and not an attempt by one of the members to gain favorable treatment. However, even in this acceptable situation, Christmas shopping for your boss could be quite difficult. 

The first area of concern when Christmas shopping for your boss is setting a budget. If you are shopping for a gift from a large group of people, it is a good idea to collect the money first and then use the amount collected to set the budget for the gift. You may ask for a small amount of money, typically around $5-$10 from each person and once the money is collected you can search for items which fall within your budget. You should not exceed the amount of money you collected because it is not considered acceptable to ask for additional money if you had promised to stay within budget. Most people have a great deal of shopping to do and being asked to contribute additional money can be somewhat of a hardship for them. However, it is considered acceptable to spend a little less than the budget as long as you refund the remaining money equally to everyone who has contributed. For example if you spend $20 less than you collected from 20 people, you should return $1 to each person who contributed. If you are the person shopping for the Christmas present you may have to exercise some common sense and make judgment calls if necessary. For example if you collect $120 and purchase an item which costs $121.04, including tax, you may opt to simply pay the additional amount yourself if you are able to do so. The additional amount is quite small and if the gift is appropriate, it might be worthwhile to incur this small expense for the sake of purchasing a perfect gift which is within your budget.

Christmas shopping for a boss can also be rather difficult because you may not know what to buy for your boss. If you are not particularly close to your boss and do not often socialize with him you may not know a great deal about his interests. In this case it might be a good idea to either ask someone who knows him better to do the Christmas shopping or at least ask them to provide you with a few gift ideas. Other employees may know the boss better because they have worked with him longer or because they participate in activities such as company softball games with him. In either case, they can probably provide you with some insight into his interests which would help you select a gift he will appreciate. If you are unable to come up with a suitable gift idea, a gift certificate to a local restaurant is always an appropriate, and appreciated, Christmas gift.
