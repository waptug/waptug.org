Application Techniques Of Tattoos

Tattoos are more common these days than they have ever been in the past.  As we all know, tattoos are decorative markings in the skin, such as symbols, signs, and letters that are applied by puncturing the outer layer of the skin and injecting color.  Tattoo guns are the best instrument to use, as they move extremely fast and are sharp enough to easily puncture the skin.

There are several types of tattoo guns available, many of which use a very sharp needle.  There are guns out there that use more than needle, although they aren’t ideal for tattoos that require strict lines or designing.  Single needle tattoo guns are the best for tattoo applications, although the needles need to be changed out after each tattoo.  Tattoo needles can be very dangerous if they aren’t disposed of - possibly leading to serious infection if they are used over and over again without being disinfected or disposed of.

There are also tattoos out there known as “jailhouse tattoos”.  These types of tattoos are normally found in jails and prisons, using homemade material for tattoo guns.  Normally, tattoo artists in jails and prisons will make their own guns, using batteries and needles for ordinary ink pens.  These tattoos aren’t very safe, and normally lead to infection.  The skin is punctured to inject the ink, although with jailhouse tattoo guns the needle will literally pull and jerk at the skin, ripping it and normally going very deep with the ink.

If the skin is jerked or ripped, it can result in the tattoo looking horrible.  In most cases, if the ink goes too deep into the skin, it can lead to an infection.  Deep ink also looks terrible as well, especially if it penetrates the third layer of skin.  For that very reason, jailhouse tattoo applications aren’t recommended and should be avoided at all costs.

With any tattoo, color is very important.  Black and white are the most commonly used colors, although there are other colors used as well.  Tattoos need to have an equal balance of color, along with the right shape.  If the shapes used in your design follow the contours of your body, the tattoo will look even more impressive.  Therefore, you should always have your tattoo applied by someone with a lot of experience.

From a technical standpoint, tattoos involve micro pigment implantation, as they are a form of body modification.  Tattoos are a design in ink, normally symbolic or decorative, permanently placed under your skin.  Tattoos have been around for hundreds of years, although tattoos in the past used everyday needles and ink - with a very high risk of infection. Although they are very common and very popular, tattoos always have risks.  No matter what type of application method is involved, there will always be a risk of infection.

Today, electronic tattoo machines are the most common methods of tattooing.  With electronic tattoo guns, the ink is injected into the skin by a group of needles that are attached to a bar.  The electronic gun moves very fast, going in and out of the skin hundreds of thousand of times per minute.  If an experienced tattoo artist uses the gun, the results can be amazing.  Experienced tattoo artists are always the way to go, as they have the experience to give you the results you want.  With the right tattoo artist and the right application technique - you should have a tattoo that you can be proud of.
