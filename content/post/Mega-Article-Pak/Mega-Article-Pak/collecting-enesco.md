Collecting Enesco

My friends and I have been collecting Enesco for several years.  We actively attend art auctions and bid on everything Enesco!  We have a lot of fun finding pieces we don’t already have and winning them.

I think collecting Enesco is fun.  I really like the Mary Moo Moo plates.  They came in a collection of eight plates from a series called Home is Where the Herd is.  I’ve had a hard time finding a complete set at an art auction, but I have found several single plates.

I started collecting Enesco right after I was married.  I went to an art auction with my sister-in-law and she pointed out some items that she was collecting.  The experience I had with her that day really made an impression on me.

I went to an art auction several months after the first one I attended and bought my first piece of Enesco.  I got my start collecting Enesco with just one plate.  I bought an Enesco plate that said Cookies are for Sharing.  I have displayed it in my kitchen ever since.

I am still lacking an Enesco plate that says Cream of the Crop.  It is hard to believe that I’ve been actively collecting Enesco for so long and have been unable to locate this plate.  I have duplicates and triplicates of several of the plates.  Each art auction I attend, I am hopeful that I will find the plate I need to complete that set.

My best friend has been collecting Enesco ever since she had a baby a few years ago.  She decided on a teddy bear design for the nursery and I gave her a shower gift of several Cherished Teddies figurines for decorating with.  She found more of the figurines at an art auction she went to with me and has been unstoppable ever since.

Precious Moments figurines have never been something that I particularly liked.  My friend’s daughter loves them.  She started collecting Enesco Precious Moments figurines after we took her with us to an art auction that had a small lot of them.  She spends significantly less on her collection than the rest of us do, but I think she’ll catch up.

My husband’s birthday is on Halloween.  He has started collecting Enesco Halloween statues.  I bought him one statue at an art auction several years for his birthday and he totally fell in love with the work of Jim Shore.

The first Enesco statue that my husband found for himself was at an art auction we attended together while on vacation.  He found the statue called Grim Reaper absolutely irresistible.  I have to agree, the detail work is positively spooky!  He has been searching for other pieces, but does not pursue collecting Enesco very actively.

My husband went golfing last weekend while I attended an art auction.  Collecting Enesco is my passion and I rarely pass up items that I really like.  I found a piece for me that added to my Moo Moo plate collection and I found a Headless Horseman for my husband’s collection.

The next piece that my husband has indicated that he wants to find at an art auction is the Jim Shore piece called Witch on a Pumpkin.  I know that collecting Enesco can be addictive and it is nice that he has decided which pieces he really wants.  I agree with my husband and really like the folk art that Jim Shore does.
