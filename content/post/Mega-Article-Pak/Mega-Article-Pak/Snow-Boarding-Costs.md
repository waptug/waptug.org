Snow Boarding Costs

So you are thinking about getting started with snow boarding and before you do you think that you will need to get to grip with the costs first. This is very sensible and is certainly something that I would recommend to anyone. If you cannot afford to get started then why try? However, I am sure that you will be pleasantly surprised to find out the kind of money that you are going to have to spend to get started. What would you say if I got lessons and on the slopes for the first time for well under $100! Yes folks, it really is that cheap, and it really is that easy. When I first got started, I stopped to consider if I would be able to afford it, and I phoned up my local slope that were really helpful in giving me an idea of all the cost that would be involved.

They firstly said that they recommend that I book up a block of 10 lessons in order to get started, but they explained that 3 would be enough. I guessed that they probably wanted me to pay more, so I decided to go for just the 3 lessons and this worked out just enough to give me the confidence to hit the slopes on my own. The fact is that the lessons cost $10 each, but it worked out a lot cheaper, because I decided to go for group lessons. This meant that when I was getting taught, I was actually getting taught with others. However this actually worked out to be better than I had imagined. It actually meant that I made some friends with which to spend some time with at the slopes, and that I now go along with every Wednesday night. It is ideal, and that is why it is maybe even better to do it on a budget!

Now the next thing that you are probably worried about is the cost that is associated with getting equipment and things like that sorted out. It may be expensive if you are wanting to go out their and get top of the range equipment, but it is just as easy and just as quick to rent out every time you go their. At my local slope, they charge the same amount for an hour on the slope whether or not you rent out equipment or not! That is why it is simply not expensive to get started, all I spent was $30 to get lessons, and I got a shot on the slope included in the price. What I would say is that if you can afford to go to the pub or go on holiday then you can certainly afford to the initial snow boarding costs. 

This really is not that expensive and that is why I have to say that it is a great sport to get started in, regardless of your age. It is a good way to make friends, have fun and learn something new. 

One cost that I forgot to mention is that I had to buy gloves. Buying gloves is simply a must, and they should be water proof gloves. If they are not water proof then you will end up with cold hands, and you will not enjoy your day out quite as much.
