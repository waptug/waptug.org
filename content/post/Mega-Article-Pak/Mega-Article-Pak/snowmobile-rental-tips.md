Snowmobile Renting Tips

When going on a snowmobile vacation, one way to lessen your hassles is to leave your snowmobiles at home and rent the equipment from the resort where you are going to stay. Many resorts that specialize in winter seasonal vacations offer snowmobile rentals and even equipment and clothing to make your snowmobile experiences safer and more enjoyable. Other vacationers might choose to ship their own snowmobiles to their destination. There are advantages and disadvantages to each option. In order to fully enjoy your snowmobiling vacation, it is important to consider the options available to you regarding your snowmobile equipment.

If you are a beginning snowmobiler, you might enjoy a snowmobiling vacation at a resort where you can rent a snowmobile and the equipment needed. Rather than buying expensive machines that you will not enjoy, many resorts offer the newest equipment available along with top-notch experts to help you learn to use it safely. This gives beginners the chance to test their enthusiasm about snowmobiling while also giving avid snowmobilers the opportunity to test out the newest equipment before buying a new one. Along with the rental of the snowmobile, customers also have the option of renting waterproof suits, boots, and gloves to help protect them from the cold weather and the winter elements while still enjoying the season. Helmets are also available and they are essential to ensure the safety of snowmobilers, whether they are beginners or experts. 

Another benefit of renting a snowmobile from a resort or dealership is that it saves money. Infrequent snowmobilers will benefit from renting a snowmobile and the equipment needed to enjoy the fun that snowmobiling has to offer. Renting a couple times a year will invariably be less expensive than buying a snowmobile every few years if you are not an avid snowmobiler. Even for avid snowmobilers, renting equipment from a resort that you are vacationing at will be less expensive – not to mention less of a hassle - than shipping your snowmobile and equipment to your vacation spot. Rental places will undoubtedly offer insurance for the rented equipment where the user will be responsible for only a deductible in case of an accident. 

An added advantage to renting a snowmobile from your vacation resort is that they normally have experienced guides who will take families or individuals along the more scenic and exciting parts of the available trails along the forests. The guides are expertly trained so they can customize tours and trails to your specific riding ability. The beginning snowmobilers will be taken on tours along smooth trails with more straight-aways while other more experienced users can choose to go on more thrilling trails that wind through the forests and hills of the winter landscape. This not only provides riders with peace of mind, but it can also give beginners and experts alike the opportunity to experience views and experiences that they otherwise would have missed if they went on the trails alone. 

Although it is easier and less expensive to rent a snowmobile from a dealer or a vacation resort, experienced users might prefer to have their equipment shipped to their vacation spot. There are several reasons for this, but the most common reason is because it may take some time for a person to get accustomed to a new snowmobile. By the time an experienced user gets accustomed to rental equipment, the vacation could be over. Several companies offer door-to-door snowmobile shipments and plenty of insurance if an owner is willing to pay for it. That option is generally used for experts and competitive riders rather than the occasional rider. Oftentimes, the amount that it takes to ship a snowmobile and the accompanying equipment is just as much, if not more, than the rental price with rental insurance included. It is up to the user to weigh the available options to make a decision based on their personal preference.
