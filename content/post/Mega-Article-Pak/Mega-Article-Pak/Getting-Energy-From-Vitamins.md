Getting Energy From Vitamins

The biggest complaint that doctors often hear from patients is a lack of energy, or the constant feeling of fatigue.  Due to these types of complaints, it really isn’t a surprise that people want to know the best types of vitamins and supplements they can get for energy.  All vitamins are ideal for staying healthy, as well as keeping your body performing in top shape.

Among vitamins and supplements, one of the most common for energy is folic acid.  Folic acid is a B vitamin that has been proven to increase energy levels.  Even though you can look for vitamins that provide energy, it would be in your best interest to find those that can be effective with fighting fatigue as well.  There are vitamins, nutrients, and supplements that are great for fighting fatigue and helping the body stay alert.

The vitamin known as NADH is very powerful for energy, although many people aren’t aware of it.  People who use vitamins on a regular basis would find themselves very impressed with the boost NADH provides.  It is often used with chronic fatigue, although the way it works can be quite complicated indeed.  Other vitamins that are great for providing energy include the msm supplement and gingko biloba.

If you happen to be on a blood thinner, such as aspirin, you should always consult with a doctor or other trained specialist before you take gingko biloba, as it is a blood thinning agent.  Even though it is considered to be an energy vitamin, if you use it with aspirin it can thin your blood down a bit too much.  If you get your blood too thin, it may lead to medical problems later on in life that can prevent you from doing the things you love.

With any vitamin that you take as a source of energy, you should always consult with your doctor.  If you have any type of heart or other serious medical condition, you may not be able to take the vitamin you are interested in.  For this reason, you should always consult with your doctor and ask for his advice.  After a few tests and exams, your doctor will be able to tell you what type of vitamins you should or shouldn’t take.

In the world of vitamins and supplements, there are many alternative sources that you can take for energy.  Whether you are a senior citizen looking to do more activities or an athlete looking to get more energy, there are many different vitamins out there that can give you what you need.  Before you rush out and explore your options though, you should always consult with your doctor first and see if there are any vitamins you shouldn’t be taking.
