What ATV Trail Best Suits Your Personality?  

“I’ve found the best ATV trail!  You have to try it!”  How many times have you heard that statement from one of your ATV-loving friends and then rushed out to have a terrific ATV riding excursion, only to find that you’re not all that enthralled by a trail that another four-wheeling enthusiast has deemed “awesome”?

Since you are an individual with a definite personality and not a robot without preferences, what leaves you breathless in terms of an ATV trail might not raise the pulse or even eyebrow of another ATV rider and vice versa.  Hence, we’ve put together the following guide to help you figure out the perfect ATV trail for you.

If you’re someone who likes speed and want to feel the wind rushing past you, then you’ll probably like an ATV trail that’s flat and fast.

Flat and fast trails are best described as terrain that allows you to gun your ATV’s motor and quickly get from one point to the next.  Your best bet is to find a low-lying area, as mountainous regions rarely have long stretches that include no twists or turns.  ATV trails in the middle states of America lend themselves to this kind of speedy ATV riding, as they are notoriously level and have an attractive, earthy quality.

If you’re a four-wheel rider who loves the thrill of wicked turns, then you should consider an ATV trail that’s twisting and wild.

You can hoot and holler along an ATV path that winds its way through a wooded area or along a stream bed. Do your best to avoid extremely rocky areas as they can be dangerous, but don’t be afraid of taking on some of the smaller hills and roaring your ATV around some of the more adventurous terrain.

If you’re an enthusiast who loves steep climbing followed by hair-raising descents, you might enjoy an ATV trail that’s up and down.

Head to the mountains, my friend!  In the mountains, you will find exactly what you’re searching for in terms of rollercoaster-like ATV adventures!  Not only will you be able to test your ATV’s moxie on some serious grades, but you’ll also be able to whiz down scenic mountainsides.  Remember to keep your speed in check, though; up and down terrain is only safe when you keep a cool head and a conservative pace.

If you’re a laid-back person who just enjoys a little bit of everything, why not try an ATV trail that’s a pleasure potpourri?

The “pleasure potpourri” is ideal for the ATV trail rider who can’t make up his or her mind as to what the “perfect” excursion might be.  And, best of all, these types of hodgepodge ATV journeys can be found almost anywhere in the country.  In fact, you might just find all the necessary elements of a mixture of hills, valleys, vistas, and gravel paths within a few miles of your own home.

No matter what your personality type, you can rest assured that there is an ATV trail out there for you and never be afraid to go outside your preferred style. Even if you’re a hard-and-fast “pleasure potpourri” four-wheeling lady or gent, you just might discover that you actually harbor a secret love of “twisting and wild” ATV paths.  You’ll never know until you try, so get out there and start exploring!
