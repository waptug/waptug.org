The eBay Shipping Center

eBay wants to help sellers with every aspect of their 
eBay business. The eBay shipping center was 
created to help ensure that you get your items to 
your customers in a timely manner, in the most 
efficient and economical way possible.

The eBay shipping center will help you print shipping 
labels, help you figure shipping costs, and even help 
you with International shipping. Shipping information 
for all of the major shipping companies, including the 
USPS can be found through the shipping center. You 
can even purchase insurance for packages that will 
be shipped by the USPS directly through the shipping 
center.

One of the greatest features of the eBay Shipping 
Center is the ability to order free co-branded shipping 
boxes for USPS shipments. These boxes are 
delivered to you, at no cost! This will cut a great deal 
of your shipping expenses because you won’t have to 
purchase your own boxes! There is also a great video 
that will teach you how to save time and money on 
your shipping, and whether you are a buyer or a 
seller, you can easily track your packages through 
the eBay shipping center as well.
