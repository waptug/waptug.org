Packing Your Bags for the Airport: What You Should Leave at Home

Each day, millions of travelers hop on an airplane to get their next destination. Whether you are planning a visit to friends or family, attending a business meeting, or just taking a family vacation, it is likely that you will not be traveling alone. Almost all air travelers bring some sort of luggage with them.  Unfortunately, when it comes to packing their bags, many travelers have no idea what they should or shouldn’t bring along.

If you are gearing up for your next trip, you are advised to carefully choose the items that you are planning on brining along with you. This includes items that will be packed in your checked baggage, in addition to your carryon luggage.  Not only should be thinking about convenience, but you should also be thinking about air travel rules, namely the rules that specify which items or materials are allowed aboard an airplane and which ones are not.  

When examining items prohibited during air travel, it is important to remember that some items may only have a partial ban. An example of a partial ban is a ban that may prevent certain items from being stored in your carryon luggage, but not in your checked baggage.  Most of these bans, such as liquids, large tools, sporting goods, and sharp objects, are imposed only for safety reasons.  

Although a large number of items are allowed to be in your checked baggage, despite being banned from your carryon luggage, there are some items that you cannot, under any circumstances, bring aboard an airplane. These items most commonly fall under the category of explosive or flammable materials.  You will find that you are prohibited from brining bombs, dynamite, gun powder, lighters, flares, or strike anywhere matches on an airplane.  In fact, trying to board an airplane with these items in your possession, whether they be in you carryon luggage or not, could land you in serious trouble.  

In addition to items that are banned by the airline industry, you will also want to think about convenience, when packing your bags for your next business trip or vacation.  When it comes to carryon luggage, you will find that some airlines restrict the size of your bags, as well as the weight. For your own convenience, you will want to keep your carryon luggage as light as possible. The same should be said for your checked baggage.  Although you may not be carrying it with you at all times, it is still advised that you pack as light as possible. A number of airlines have strict weight limits on carryon luggage.  If your luggage weights more than what is allowed, you may be charged an extra fee or you may even be required to remove some of your belongings.  

It is also advised that you think of the items that you are brining along with you, specifically their monetary and semimetal value. When traveling aboard an airplane, there are a number of instances where you belongings may suffer damage, especially those stored in checked baggage. If you would take a large financial or emotional hit from the loss or destruction of your personal belongings, you are advised to leave those items at home. Although you may not be able to have your laptop with you or your favorite piece of jewelry, it is nice to know that your treasured items are safe at home.
It may seem like a difficult task to leave some of your belongings at home, but you are encouraged to do so, whenever possible.  By keeping all of the above mentioned points into consideration, you are sure to not only avoid trouble at the airport, but have less to worry about as well.
