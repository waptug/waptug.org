Intro To CD Duplication

The first thing you must know, is that there are many
different types of CD duplication.  Some of them happen
to be illegal, which is why you'll need to make sure
that the CDs you are duplicating are allowed by local
laws and regulations.  

The CD duplication process is basically taking one
CD and making a copy of it, or if you prefer, many
copies of it.  A CD can store information of many 
forms, such as pictures, movies, data, and even 
music.  Therefore, you'll need to determine which type
of duplication you are interested in.

You'll also need to think about how many copies you
plan to make as well, as the costs of equipment will
vary.  Most computers that you buy these days will
come with a CD-RW drive, and the software you'll
need to make copies of the CD disks. 

CD duplication is very easy to do, as you all you have
to do is a few clicks.  Even if you are new to 
computers, you'll find that duplicating CDs is one
of the easiest things you'll do with your computer.

With the common software, you can copy an audio or
even a data disk in just a few minutes.  The most
common program is Nero, as it does wonders for CD
duplication and CD-RW drives.  If you have access
to Nero, you'll find it very easy to use and very
handy to have installed on your computer.

Once you begin to copy CDs, you can make copies of
your audio CDs, back up your computer, even make
copies of your pictures.  The sky is the limit with
CD duplication - which is the main reason it has
become so popular over the years.
