A Look At Ice Wine

Although there are several types of wine that you buy, one of the most unheard of is ice wine.  Ice wine is a very rare form of wine, a wine that is produced under certain types of weather conditions.  Ice wine is mainly produced in the Pacific Northwest region, where the weather conditions are right for the wine.  

As ironic as it is, ice wine is produced in very small quantities.  With the wine requiring only the fines of quality and a lack of availability, the product is extremely rare indeed.  Truth be told, there are only a lucky few who are actually able to purchase the wine.  Ice wine, due to the scarce amount, can be extremely expensive and out of the price range for a majority of us.

Much like the beauty of owning a diamond, ice wine is something that many of us hope and dream to experience at some point in our lives.  Although the materials are rare, the weather conditions are even more crucial to producing this wine.  Once the right weather conditions arrive, the wine maker prepares to produce this extremely rare and priceless wine.

The basic requirements needed to produce ice wine are fully ripened grapes and a temperature of around 5 degrees C.  The temperature needs to stay that way for several days, so that the wine maker can complete the process of making the wine.  Grapes that are frozen during these extremely cold temperatures are hand plucked at night by the wine maker and his assistants.

To produce a bottle of ice wine, full vine grapes may be required. Once the grapes have been collected, they are gently pressed, in order to collect the running juice only.  The temperature creates the frozen water crystals, which are fermented along with sugars and the particles that are found in the free running juices.  Through this process, the wonderful and rare ice wine is created.

If you have been looking to try ice wine, finding it may be very difficult.  As you probably already know, most alcohol and wine stores don’t sell this rare wine.  Finding it online is very hard to do as well, unless you catch it at the right time.  Even then, if you are able to find it, it can easily cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single bottle.

The best way to experience ice wine is to find the right wine maker in the Pacific Northwest region.  Even though bottles go extremely fast once they have been made, you may be able to catch a wine maker with some on hand.  Be prepared to spend a hefty amount though.  Although it can cost a lot and be extremely hard to find - the taste of ice wine makes it well worth the effort.
