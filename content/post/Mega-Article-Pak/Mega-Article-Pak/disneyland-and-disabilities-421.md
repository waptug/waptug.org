Disneyland and Disabilities

Even if you are confined to a wheelchair or on 
crutches, you can still enjoy Disneyland. If you are 
on crutches, you should consider renting a 
Disneyland Scooter to get around the park. The 
rental fee is $35 per day, with a $20 deposit. A valid 
driver’s license is required, and you must be 
eighteen years old or older. 

You can also choose to rent a wheelchair, which is 
not electronic. The rental fee for a wheelchair is $8 
per day, with a $20 deposit. You do not have to rent 
your wheelchair or Scooter from Disneyland. You can 
choose to rent the apparatus from a private company,
 and have the wheelchair or scooter delivered to your 
hotel room. You may find that it is cheaper to rent 
from a private company, as opposed to renting from 
Disneyland.

All of the restaurants and shops are wheelchair 
accessible, as are the entertainment areas. When it 
comes to wheelchairs, your problem will be 
accessing some of the rides. Some rides are not 
appropriate for people who are in wheelchairs, 
while others are perfectly suitable. For instance, you 
will not be able to enjoy Donald’s Boat, Sailing Ship, 
or Tarzan’s Tree house. 

However, there are many attractions that you can 
enjoy, such as The Disney Gallery, Disneyland 
Monorail, the Disneyland Railroad, the Tiki Room, 
The Golden Horseshoe, It’s A Small World, Mark 
Twain Riverboat, and Tom Sawyer Island. Some 
attractions will require you to be transferred from your 
wheelchair, such as Alice in Wonderland, Indiana 
Jones, and the King Arthur Carrousel. 

Cast members and service personnel will be happy 
to help with Guest wheelchair transfers, and if you 
should lose a wheelchair or scooter that you’ve rented 
from Disneyland, simply show the ticket for the 
wheelchair or scooter, and Disneyland will happily 
supply you with another one. However, if you lose a 
wheelchair or scooter that was rented from an outside
company, Disneyland will not be able to help you 
replace it, and you may have to pay the rental company
 the full value of the chair. This is something to consider 
when you are trying to decide whether to rent from 
Disneyland or a private company.

Whether you can enjoy a ride in your wheelchair, or 
you must be transferred from your wheelchair to the 
ride, you can actually enjoy most of the rides at 
Disneyland. Do not allow the fact that you can’t walk 
around the park keep you from planning a Disneyland 
Vacation. Again, Disneyland was designed with 
everyone in mind!
