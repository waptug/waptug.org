Why streaming video on blogs is popular 

One may have noticed that recently it became very popular for individuals to post streaming videos on their blogs or online journals.  Some people may have asked themselves why streaming video on blogs is popular, and the answer to this can be fairly in depth.  First of all, the purpose of a blog is to share information with one’s self or others.  Most people that are going to be using a computer are fairly literate, but in some cases the individuals are not.  When they come to a blog, they can get some of the information from the video and still be able to have a more dependable grasp on the concept, as opposed to not being able to view the video or read the blog.  Secondly, many people do not have time during their busy day to commit to reading.  It is not very easy to read something, and perform other actions at the same time.

However, many people will notice that we are able to watch television and do other things at the same time.  The same is true when it comes to viewing streaming videos on blogs.  Whether the individual is just doing other things on the computer, or they are actually away from the computer but watching the video as if it were the television, the individual that is doing the viewing is able to multi-task in a way that they would be unable to do without the video on the blog.  This simply helps to smooth out a person’s life so that they can do other things at the same time, should the individual be in a hurry or want to multi-task.

Some people do not read as fast as others.  However, we all view things at the same speed.  When an individual is not able to read something quickly, they may not be as inclined to work on reading a blog that they may otherwise be interested in reading.  In order to make up for this, many people will post streaming videos on their blog sites in order to capture the attention of an individual that may be either viewing the videos on the blog or reading the blog itself.  If a person sees a video that they are interested in, they may be more likely to read the blog that coincides with it, even if they are a slow reader, because of the fact that they enjoyed the video.  However, this may not be as true of the individual that does not have a video to help pull them in to the blog itself.

Instead, a person may merely skim the blog or skip it entirely.  We are in an age of constantly moving, and unless a person makes a conscious effort to stop and observe something, they are not as inclined to do so.  When people wonder why streaming video on blogs is popular, they really only need to look at the many ways in which the individuals involved are able to prosper both by viewing the video and by posting the video.
