New York City is a Shopper's Paradise

New York is a treasure trove of so many things that it is quite difficult to select one thing to mention when discussing this wonderful city. If you are a natural born shopper and bargain hunter though you would be remiss not to head out to New York with the idea of finding some fabulous bargains in mind.

I can't imagine many places in the world that have quite the number of shopping options that are available to New Yorkers on a daily basis. It's hard to imagine that there are people who actually have never felt the thrill of getting that little extra percent off or finding a perfectly good second hand piece for less than a quarter of what that item would have cost new. At the same time, there are very few things that I can mentally justify paying full price for. 

Perhaps this is why New York represents shopper's heaven to me. There are so many consignment stores, used clothes stores, vintage clothes stores, and the bargains don't end at clothing. There is consignment furniture, house wares, even tools can be found at bargain prices in very specialized consignment and second hand stores. Electronics and appliances can be found in these types of stores as well. It's truly amazing all the wonderful things that can be found at bargain basement prices by those who are truly willing to look for them.

In addition to the many consignment, second hand, and goodwill type stores that you can find in New York City, there are also plenty of outlet stores that offer lower prices for last years overstock or slightly flawed patterns. It's amazing the bargains you can find when these stores have sales. Of course shopping your regular shopping malls just after Christmas or a couple of weeks after school has started can also net some very similar values. The real beauty lies in the fact that you can actually go to these stores while these sales are going on and have wardrobes for your kids for the next school year (provided some unholy sort of abnormal growth spurt doesn't occur in the meantime). 

If shopping for you is more like a calling than an adventure then you should have a great time just wandering around the many malls and shopping centers of New York trying to get into your head the close proximity of so many wonderful bargains and how everyone in that city isn't either filing for bankruptcy or in serious hoc due to credit cards that are spent well beyond their limits.

Of course my kryptonite is shoes. I have a very difficult time walking by a sale on shoes even when I know the price isn't as good as it could or should be. I love shoes, particularly Birkenstock's. You simply cannot buy Birkenstock's second hand and even the sales prices on these shoes are more than you'd pay for many at full retail. I once thought they were the ugliest shoes on the planet and while I'll agree they aren't the cutest they are quite arguably the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. If you ever notice a really good sale on shoes and a brunette whirlwind rushing by, it's probably me chanting 'see no evil, speak no evil, do no evil' and trying to convince myself that there really is nothing to see here.
