Bifocal Contact Lenses

For a majority of us, presbyopia is something we have to live with.  In definition, presbyopia is the lack of focusing on things in close range.  The cause for this, is the lens in our eyes becoming less and less flexible as we grow older.  The bad part is, most of us will need some type of corrective lenses, such as contact lenses or glasses and possibly even bifocals at some point in our lives as this condition gets worse.

Up until recently, those who wore bifocals had very limited options when they chose their corrective lenses.  Years ago, glasses that contained bifocal lenses were just about the only option available.  Over the years, no-line lenses were created, and glasses became a bit more attractive.  This was a very definitive time for bifocal correction lenses, as they looked a lot better than they ever did in the past - eliminating the bulky and unattractive appearance they were well known for.

Now days, you can find many different types of bifocal contact lenses on the market.  They are gaining in popularity, as they give those who wear bifocal glasses a very attractive alternative to wearing bulky glasses.  They are very affordable as well - which makes them a more popular choice in the world of corrective lenses.

What many may not realize, is the fact that bifocal contacts are very similar to glass lenses in the way they work.  With glass lenses, each separate lens provides a range of focus adjustments, one for distance and another for being close up on something.  With bifocal contact lenses, both of the adjustments are included.  There are different manufacturers that produce different types of bifocal contact lenses, meaning that it may take you a bit of research and experimenting to find which type works the best for you.

Some lenses however, are made with a unique design, known as concentric.  Similar to concentric circles, there are two adjustments - one in the middle the other around the outside.  These two adjustments in the contact lens are very distinct, with a sharp line between them.  Even though they may sound hard to use, most people find that they are easy use with a little bit of practice.

One type of bifocal lens is the aspheric lens, which have a more gradual change of focus.  Both power are in the central area of the pupil, and similar to the concentric lens, your eye will immediately adjust to these lenses and decide on the focus that is best to use.

The third and possibly best lens for bifocal use is the translating lens.  Just like bifocal glass lenses, the near correction is found at the bottom of the lens, and the distance correction is found at the top.  These lenses aren’t able to shift when in the eye, as they are normally made so they aren’t able to shift around.  This can be great for older individuals, as these contacts won’t move around no matter what you do.

When it comes to bifocal contact lenses, you should always ask your optician what he thinks is best for your eyes.  If you meet the right criteria, chances are you’ll be prescribed bifocal contact lenses.  If you wear bifocal glasses, you may find these contacts to be the perfect alternative.  You can get bifocal lenses in extended wear, daily disposable, or even conventional - which is great for anyone who likes plenty of choices.  With a lot to choose from and a lot to offer - bifocal contact lenses are the ideal alternative for anyone who needs bifocal correction lenses.
