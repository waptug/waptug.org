Vitamin E And Your Body

We all know that oxygen is a primary component that is needed for life.  This very same oxygen, once inside of the body, becomes very reactive through certain molecules and will start to cause damage through the free radicals, which is known as oxidative stress.  As an antioxidant, vitamin E will help to prevent this type of stress, which will prevent the cells from aging or sustaining any type of permanent damage as well.

Cholesterol, which is a fatty substance found in many foods, is absorbed by the body then transferred from the liver to be stored by tissue as fat.  This is carried through the bloodstream by molecules known as LDL (Low Density Lipoproteins).  When the LDL is oxidized, it reacts to the cholesterol and a fat substance known as plaque begins to get deposited on the artery walls, which causes the blood flow to stop.

Vitamin E will stop cholesterol from forming into plaque, which will allow the blood to flow properly.  If you don’t use vitamin E, in this situation, the blood will stop flowing and the arteries will begin to get backed up.  As most of us know, this is the main cause of heart attacks, high blood pressure, and other serious diseases.

Even though many researchers and doctors have linked vitamin E to preventing cancer, this hasn’t been conclusively proven.  There are many doctors that have said in the past that vitamin E can indeed prevent cancer, although no documentation or proof has been given to back up such statements.  We all know that it is a very important vitamin, regardless.

There are studies however, that have proven vitamin E to be very effective in protecting the skin against UV rays.  Vitamin E has been shown on numerous occasions to shield the skin from the harmful rays of the sun, which as we all know, can lead to skin cancer.  If you include sources of vitamin E, or supplements in your diet you can help to prevent the damage of UV rays to your skin.

Along with these types of benefits, vitamin E can also protect against alzheimer’s disease and inflammation of the pancreas.  This vitamin can also be very beneficial with reducing scars, and healing many types of burns and wounds.  Included in your diet, vitamin E can help your skin to heal from many discrepancies over time.

When included with vitamin C, vitamin E can be one of the most important vitamins for your body.  It offers many different benefits, besides the ones listed above.  You can find it in many different forms, including fruits and nuts.  Fruits are excellent sources of vitamin E, especially oranges.  Oranges have always been known to be rich in this vitamin, whether you are consuming whole oranges or just drinking orange juice.  If you are drinking orange juice that contains pulp, you’ll be getting plenty of vitamin E in your diet.

All things aside, you should always make sure that you include vitamin E in your diet.  Along with fruits and nuts, you can also find this vitamin plentiful in vegetables as well.  You can include it into your diet, or take supplements that provide it.  You should be getting around 1,000 mg of the vitamin a day, which isn’t hard to do if you eat the right foods.  If you consume the right amount of vitamin E in your diet, you’ll notice that your body will perform much better - and you’ll be well protected against numerous diseases as well.
