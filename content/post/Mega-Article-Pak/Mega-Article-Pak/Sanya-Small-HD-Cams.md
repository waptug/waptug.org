Sanyo Small HD Cams

Sanyo has recently brought a new level of credability
to dual use, video and still image cameras with the
introduction of the new Xacti HD1.  With measurements
of 3.1X4, 7X1.4 inches and 8.3 ounces, it is easily
the smallest camera to record 720p high definition
video.  It will also capture 5.1 MP still images and 
has a 10X optical zoom lens as well.

Just like other dual use cameras, it will record
both video and still images on a memory card, or
in this case an SD card instead of video tape.  
According to Sanyo, a 1GB SD card can record up to
21 minutes of 720p 16:9 widescreen video.  If you
prefer to record in standard definition, the HD1
can also record video at 640X480 pixel resolution
at either 30 or 60 frames per second.  Everything
you record is with the popular MPEG 4 compression.

Just in case pocket sized HD recording isn't enough
for you, Sanyo also put a 2.2 inch 210,000 pixel
OLED display in the HD1.  The OLED is a display
technology that many thing will end up replacing
LCD very soon.  The advantages offered include wider
viewing angles and faster response time.  

As you probably already know, Sanyo isn't new to
HD video cameras or digital cameras in general.
Sanyo has been around for years, proving that they
can compete with the bigger industry giants.  The
small HD video cameras offered from Sanyo are 
among the best as well.

If you've been looking for the best HD video cameras,
rest assured that anything you select from Sanyo
is going to be great.  There are a few to choose
from, with the HD1 leading the pack.  If you want
the best, the HD1 is everything you need - and 
quite possibly a bit more.
