Mobility Scooters That Make It In The Fast Lane

Mobility scooters have made a tremendously positive impact on the ability of those with physical challenges to perform their daily activities and participate in social events.  Although mobility scooters are intended to be of physical assistance and are not manufactured or designed essentially for speed, many experienced riders already know and enjoy the benefits they receive from their mobility scooter, but they may wish they could move just a little bit quicker. There are a few mobility scooters that are faster than others. Fast mobility scooters might be appreciated by those who use their scooter to run local errands or for those who visit parks, golf courses, playgrounds and other outdoor attractions where a good amount of territory is generally covered at a moderate pace throughout the course of the visit.  A fast mobility scooter will allow the user to keep up with friends and family and enjoy many of the same sites. 

When we are considering fast as it relates to electric mobility scooters, it is important to note that electric mobility scooters range in power and speed from approximately 5 mph to about 13 mph. The faster models are generally intended for outdoor use as opposed to indoor use, where traveling speed is usually not a very high concern. 

As a general guideline, rear wheel drive mobility scooters will tend to be faster than front wheel drive models. Front wheel drive models tend to have a less powerful motor providing power to the front wheel or wheels which pull the rider and the scooter. Whereas a rear wheel drive mobility scooter is driven by the rear wheels which push, as opposed to pull, the combined weight of the scooter and the rider. This motor and wheel configuration also permits the use of a larger motor and therefore distributes more power. 

Pride Mobility Products Corporation knows a little bit about speed. This fast growing company was founded in 1986 and has taken the fast track to over $76 million in annual sales! Their brand name is almost synonymous with mobility scooters. Pride Mobility produces a wide variety of mobility scooters that can be used on just about any terrain. Amongst those who have purchased Pride’s brand of mobility scooters are the elderly and disabled including well known celebrities like scientist Stephen Hawking and actor Verne Troyer of ‘Austin Powers’ fame.

Pride Mobility offers a fast mobility scooter introduced as the Wrangler PMV. For approximately $3500 you can be traveling at 10 mph. The Wrangler is a rugged mobility scooter intended for outdoor use. Thirteen inch deep tread tires help to make the Wrangler reliable and fast even on the roughest terrain.  It uses two 100AH batteries and has two motors for ultimate traction. The seven inch ground clearance will help to ensure that you don’t get stuck in a tough spot. The rugged construction of the Pride Mobility Wrangler line of mobility scooters does not compromise the comfort and convenience that are incorporated into all of Pride’s designs. The Wrangler comes standard with a high back seat that is available in your choice of size and color and with flip back arm rests and a head rest for comfort. For those who still enjoy golfing but not the travel on the course, additional options available for the Wrangler include a golf bag holder that will turn your mobility scooter into the ultimate golf cart making the Wrangler a fast, convenient and personalized way to get to the 18th hole!
