What to Consider Before Decorating Your Lawn for Christmas

Each year, millions of Americans choose to decorate their homes for Christmas. While many individuals keep the Christmas decorations on the inside of their homes, not all do.  There are a fairly large number of individuals who also choose to decorate the outside of their homes, namely their lawns. If you are interested in decorating your front yard for Christmas, there are a number of important factors that you may first want to keep in mind. These factors may reaffirm your decision to decorate your lawn for Christmas, but they may also want to make you change your mind.

Perhaps, the most important thing to think about is what type of decorations you want in your front yard.  In the United States, as previously mentioned, a large number of individuals decorate their front yards with Christmas decorations. These yard decorations come in a number of different formats. There are some homeowners who simply place a Santa yardstick in their yard or add lights to the outside of their home, but other homeowners go all out, some with huge inflatable Santa dolls and other colorful decorations.  The type of Christmas decorations that you plan on using, as well as how many will make it easier to determine whether or not you should decorate your lawn for Christmas.

Unfortunately, there are many homeowners who feel that they can do whatever they want to their property because it is their right to do so. While it is your right to decorate your home, as well as your front yard, you will want to take your neighbors into consideration. If you live in a highly populated community, there is a good chance that large lawn decorations, especially those with bright lights, may cause some discomfort among your neighbors.  You will not want to create a Christmas lawn display that has your neighbors up all night because your Christmas lights are shining into their bedroom. That is why it may be a good idea to speak to your neighbors before decorating your lawn, especially if you plan on creating a large display.  You may find that your neighbors do not even care.   

In addition to what your neighbors think, you may also want to be concerned with what your town, city, or county officials think. While you might not necessarily know this, there are some cities, towns, and counties that have strict regulations on what can or cannot be placed on a lawn. This is most commonly seen with business signs or election signs. While your local community may not have these restrictions, it is important that you check ahead of time. If you do set up a large Christmas display and you are legally prohibited from doing so, you will likely just receive a warning the first time, but action may be taken later. That is why it is important that you know what you are getting yourself into ahead of time.

Before deciding to decorate your lawn for Christmas, it might be a good idea to examine the cost of doing so.  While it is possible to find a number of low-cost Christmas decorations for the lawn, such as small lawn signs and outdoor Christmas lights, the larger you want your display to be the more you will have to pay.  If you are looking for large decorations, such as an inflatable Santa and reindeer set, you will need to pay quite a bit more money.  These decorations may cost fifty dollars or more.  If you are decorating for Christmas on a budget, it may be difficult or impossible for you to find large, affordable Christmas decorations, unless you are willing to buy used decorations.  It may also be a good idea to examine the cost of extra cost of electricity, especially if you are using a large number of Christmas lights.  

When it comes to decorating your lawn, as mentioned above, there are a number of advantages and disadvantages.  By keeping the above mentioned points in mind, you should be able to decide for your own whether or not it is a good idea for you to decorate the outside of your home for Christmas.
