Take a good look at your closet in its entirety. How much of the room in your closet is actually being taken up by your clothing, don’t count the ones piled up on the floor! How much space is just wide open and not being used? In most cases, at least twice as much closet space is just bare compared to what you are using. Most closets have a similar layout – one long clothes hanging rod and a shelf above it. If this is how your closet layout is, then why not make some changes and start using that space?
