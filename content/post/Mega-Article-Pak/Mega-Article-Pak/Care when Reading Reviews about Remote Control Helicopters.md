Take Care when Reading Reviews about Remote Control Helicopters 

I have read tons of reviews for remote control helicopters, because I am the editor of a helicopter aficionado magazine that talks about all the types of helicopters on the market and recommends the best one to buy if you are a first time owner or a remote control helicopter veteran.  The magazine is great, and it helps me see what other helicopter owners think about different models and brands of helicopters, and I really must say that people’s opinions vary widely, which is why it’s probably always best to just do your own research and get what best suits you, rather than getting what you think best suits you based on some stranger’s opinion.  That said, many people who are buying their first remote control helicopters don’t really know what they are looking for, and it is these people that these reviews are written for.

But they are not meant to be taken literally, but rather as a framework to find what other people consider valuable aspects of helicopter buying.  Then you need to think for yourself whether you care, for instance, whether the helicopter blades are made of paper or platinum (although your choices would most likely be more like metal or plastic, but I just meant that as an example).  All in all, I like this magazine because it considers people from all walks of life, and it understands that even if you are interested in purchasing a helicopter, you may not be a rich and bored millionaire with any amount of money and no consideration for finding the best deal.

We all know that these days money is hard to come by, and consumers are becoming more and more knowledgeable about their purchases, which is a wonderful thing in my opinion.  Of course, there are other people who just want to get the most money they can for themselves, so they mark up helicopter prices to exorbitant amounts and hope they’ll get a few foolish customers that didn’t do their homework.

And they probably do get a few of those customers, because they stay in business somehow, and I regularly hear horror stories about people who paid way too much for their remote control helicopter, and when I ask them why they didn’t take the time to read the reviews in my magazine, they usually say that they didn’t know about the magazine, or worse, that they didn’t have enough time.  So they had enough time to work their butts off for that money, but then not enough time to read a measly magazine review?  I think not.  Hopefully, consumers in the future will just continue to become more and more careful about their purchases, because I hate to see people in debt.

It’s such a sad thing.  If you happen to be a new helicopter enthusiast, or you know someone who is, please make sure you read the remote control helicopters reviews before making your purchase.  It can literally save you hundreds of your hard earned dollars.
