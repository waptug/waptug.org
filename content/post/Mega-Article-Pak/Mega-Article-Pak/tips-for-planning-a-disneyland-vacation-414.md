Tips for Planning a Disneyland Vacation

For many people, planning a Disneyland Vacation 
is part of the fun of the vacation itself! For others, 
however, it can be a headache. Before you start 
planning your vacation, determine whether or not you 
are really up to planning the trip yourself or not.

If you don’t want to plan your own trip, you have 
several options. Of course, you can have a travel 
agent make all of the arrangements for you, but for 
the best Disneyland experience, you might be better 
off using the Disney Vacation Planning Services. 
Either way, you can have every single aspect of your 
trip planned for you. Once you get there, all you will 
need to do is follow your Itinerary.

If you prefer the fun involved in planning your 
Disneyland vacation yourself, there are some things 
that you absolutely must not leave out of the planning 
stage. Before you can decide what you will be doing at 
Disneyland, you must determine which dates you will 
be there. The parks offer different things at different 
types of the year, with many different themes and 
entertainment to choose from.

Once you know when you will be at Disneyland, the 
next step is to figure out what you will be doing each 
day that you are there. Once you’ve set up your travel 
arrangements and your hotel reservations, there are a 
few more things you must consider.

Food is one thing you might want to arrange in 
advance. Disneyland is a very popular place, and 
having reservations at some of the more popular 
restaurants is recommended. These reservations can 
be made well in advance – before you ever leave home. 

When planning which attractions at Disneyland you 
want to visit, use a map of Disneyland as a guide. 
This will make it easier to schedule time for 
attractions that are near each other. You want to see 
and do as much as possible, so as much walking or 
travel time as you can.

Keep your budget in mind. Often, by making 
arrangements through travel agents or through the 
Disneyland Vacation Planning Services, you will be 
able to get better deals – which can save you money.
Look for these deals, and save as much money as 
you can on your hotel and food. If you have small 
children with you, keep their priorities in mind – they 
have less interest in where they will sleep and the 
food that they will eat, and more interest in what they 
will see and do!
