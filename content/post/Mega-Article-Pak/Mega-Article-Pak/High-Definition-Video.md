High Definition Video

HDTV or high definition television normally refers
to any video system of higher resolution than the
standard definition.  The original HD specifications
date back to the early 1980s, when Japan first
experimented with a 1025 line television standard.

Japan presented their parameters at an international
meeting of television engineers in Algiers in 1981
and Japan's NHK presented their analog HDTV system
at a Swiss conference in 1983.  Except for these
early formats, HDTV is digital broadcast and 
therefore it's introduction will sometimes conincide
with the introduction of DTV, or digital television.

The signals for high definition require a high 
definition television or a computer monitor in order
to be watched or viewed.  High definition video 
will normally have an aspect ratio of 16:9.  The
aspect ratio of the regular widescreen film that is
shot today is normally 1:85:1 or 2:40:1.  The 
standard type of television has a 4:3 aspect ratio.

High definition television resolution is 1080 or
720 lines.  With the contrast, regular digital
television is 480 lines or 576 lines.  The current
quality with DVD is not high definition, although
high definition systems such as HD-DVD and Blu-Ray
are both expected to be and ship later on in 2006.

The most noted feature with high definition video
is the fact that it's so life like.  There is HDTV,
and HD video cameras.  High definition is very 
popular these days, with television being at the 
top of the list.

High definition video cameras are getting just as
popular, as they offer you the chance to capture
memories like never before.  HD offers you video
like never before, making you wonder if things are
this good now - just what will video in the future
actually be like?
