The Great Installation Debate

One huge questions looms in the minds of many who elect to purchase massive home theater systems for their homes: Do I install it myself or pay for installation? This great debate seems to consume consumers the world over and there really is no easy answer as it completely and entirely depends on your own confidence of your abilities and whether or not you will postpone the work for six months or get right to it once you get your home theater-well home. 

In my house it all depends on who wants the product most and who has the ability to handle an installation. I've learned that when it comes to things such as home theaters my husband is an ace at getting it done right away. On the other hand I lugged my laundry to the laundry mat for 6 weeks while a washing machine and dryer sat in my basement waiting for him to install them. With this in mind, I pay for installation on anything that I want installed quickly and if it doesn't matter too terribly much to me, I'll leave it to him to install on his own timeline. 

Of course timing isn't the only consideration when it comes to the installation of your home theater equipment. Knowledge is actually a key component. If you break something during the course of installation it may not be covered by the warranty, particularly if it is easy to prove that it was broken and not the result of a factory defect. At the same time you do not wish to get down to the last little bit only to discover that one small part is missing, which may actually require you to take everything out, box it up, and return it to the store. Time is money for many of us and going through the installation process twice is not only frustrating it is expensive (even in terms of the amount of our leisure time it robs us of). 

There are of course other considerations when it comes to the decision of whether or not to pay the price of professional installation and one of those is the warranty on your home theater system and its components. There are some warranties that are nullified if you do not have your home theater factory or professionally installed. You need to be certain if you are installing your own home theater that your warranty won't be wasted as a result.

There are positives to consider when it comes to installing your home theater as well. Number one on that list is the amount of money you will save. Professional installation (anything with professional in front of it for that matter) is quite costly and many consumers neglect to consider that when budgeting for their home theaters. In many cases professional installation can be a real deal breaker when it comes to getting the home theater system that you really want. 

The second positive when it comes to performing the installation yourself is that you know without a doubt how to take it apart and move the pieces if you ever have the occasion or need to do so (such as a move or the need to repair or replace certain pieces or parts). It is also a good idea to know where everything  plugs in and doing the installation yourself will give you a clear indication of that as well.

Finally, there is a sense of pride that comes with knowing you did it yourself and you did it well. Being able to accomplish something that not everyone is able or willing to do on their own is impressive and something you should take great pride in doing. Whether you decide to go with professional installation (there is no shame in this decision) or installing your home theater system for yourself I wish you many years of enjoyment with your new home theater.
