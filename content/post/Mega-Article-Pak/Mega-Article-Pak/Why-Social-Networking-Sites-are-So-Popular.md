Why Social Networking Sites are So Popular

Do you use the internet on a regular basis?  If you do, there is a good chance that you have heard of websites like MySpace, FriendFinder, Classmates, or Yahoo! 360.  What do all of these websites have in common?  They are known as social networking websites.  Social networking websites, over the past few years, have rapidly increased in popularity, so much that many are wondering why.

If you have used a social networking website before, it is likely that you are already fully aware of their popularity and the reason for popularity. There is just something about these websites that draw in millions of internet users.  With a wide variety of different social networking websites available, there are a wide variety of different reasons for their popularity.  One those reasons being the ease of use.  

Social networking websites are, for the most part, easy to use. Most sites are easy to navigate.  In fact, many require little knowledge of the internet. In addition to being easy to navigate, social networking websites also make it easier to meet new people online. There are many internet users who would love to make new friends online; however, that can sometimes be difficult do. Without social networking websites, you would have to connect with internet users, often in chat rooms, and learn about their interests before deciding if you would like to consider them your “buddy.”  Social networking sites allow you to learn information about another internet user before ever having to make contact with them.

Another one of the many reasons why social networking sites are popular is because many are free to use. In fact, the majority of social networking sites, such as MySpace and Yahoo! 360, are free to use.  Despite being free to use, many websites require that you register with them. This registration will not only allow you to create your own profile or online webpage, but it will also allow you to contact other networking members.  

Although most social networking websites are free to use, there are some that are not.  Classmates is one of those websites.  Many of these websites give you a free trial period or a free membership. That membership can be used to help you determine whether or not the website is worth paying for. What is nice about paid online social networking websites is that many can be considered exclusive.  Since most internet users would not want to pay for something that they can get for free, most paid social networking sites are limited on the number of members they have. This may work out to your advantage because it tends to eliminate those who create fake accounts or aim to cause controversy online.

Social networking websites are also popular because they come in a wide variety of different formats.  Websites like Yahoo! 360 and MySpace focus on a wide variety of different topics. This means that just about anyone can join.  However, there are other social networking sites out there that have a particular focus. These focuses may be on a particular religion, political following, or hobby.  Most specialty social networking sites restrict the individuals that can participate in their network; thus, making your experience more enjoyable.

Finally, social networking websites focus on meeting new people, especially online, but over recent months, many have started including additional features only available to their online members. Many social networking members can receive their own free webpage, get free access to popular music videos, a free blog, and much more.  Although social networking websites are popular enough to bring in members on their own, these additional features are, in a way, providing internet users with an incentive to join.  

Mentioned above were a few of the most popular social networks that could be found online. Those networks included MySpace, Yahoo! 360, and Classmates. If you are looking for additional social networking websites, you should easily be able to find some by performing a standard internet search.
