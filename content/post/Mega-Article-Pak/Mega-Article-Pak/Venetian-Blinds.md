Venetian Blinds

Anyone who is familiar with Venetian blinds knows just
how difficult they are to clean, with laterally slatted
strips of plastic with dangling cords that gets on
everyone's nerves since they always seemed to get in
a tangle.  A majority of us can't find anything uglier
or messier than blinds that hang crooked.  Manufacturers
are however, starting to make them more functional, more
attractive, and easier to clean.

The first thing you'll need to make sure of, is that the
blinds are hung properly, as this will ensure that your
window covering is successful.  If your blinds are hung
crooked, then the strings won't properly act as
pulleys.  No matter how pretty they may be, they won't
be any good if they don't work properly.

The only time you should use the old fashioned plastic
Venetian blinds is if you are going for more of a retro
look.  If you are going for the retro look, it may be
better to consider using the anodized aluminum or 
painted silver blinds.  These types of blinds tend to
collect less dirt and dust and will help complete the
look better with your retro room.

Most manufacturers are now creating Venetian blinds in
different colors and textures.  They do this by
painting, coating, or even anodizing the slats.  They
have neon colors, metallic bronze, silver, and even
gold to choose from now.  

The boring blinds of the 90s can be found as institutional
window treatments.  In the past, when decorating an
office, people would have chosen white or black 
blinds to go with the wood decor.  Now, you can 
choose from shades of olive, burgundy, or even brown.
If your office has more of a sleeker look, you can 
even choose a Venetian blind in cherry red or celadon
color.

If you feel that your room is outdated or you just
need to re-decorate and your on a budget, then a new
window treatment may be the answer.  Even though
Venetian blinds can be considered outdated, they
can easily be jazzed up with drapes or sheers.  If
you are re-decorating a room that it may be hard to
find blinds for, such as a boxed shape window or a 
small window, you may be able to choose the older
style mini blinds in various vibrant colors.

If you are just trying to make a truly unique fashion
statement, then you should consider hand painting
your Venetian blinds.  You can choose to show off
your individuality and your craftier side by painting
the blind to show an image once it is closed.
