Get More Out of Your Disneyland Vacation With 
FastPass

You don’t want to spend your entire Disneyland 
Vacation standing in long lines. This can be avoided
by using Disneyland FastPass. FastPass can be 
obtained from machines located near the rides that 
accept FastPass. This doesn’t mean that you get to 
immediately move to the front of the line. It is more 
like scheduling an appointment for the ride later in 
the day – at which time you actually will move to 
the front of the line. In the meantime, you are free
to go enjoy other sites and rides around the park.

When you obtain a FastPass ticket, you will be 
given a one hour time in which to enjoy the ride. For 
instance, your FastPass ticket may say 11am to 
12pm. This means that you can show up and move 
to the front of the line between the hours of 11am and 
12pm. You must have your Disneyland ticket in order 
to obtain a FastPass ticket.

At Disneyland, FastPasses are available for Indiana 
Jones, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain 
Railroad, Roger Rabbits Cartoon Spin, Autopia, 
Space Mountain, and Buzz Lightyear.
