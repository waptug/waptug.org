Exercise And Asthma

If you suffer from asthma, you probably think that you
can't exercise properly or safely.  Contrary to what
many think of this subject, there are ways that you
can get in shape and exercise, even if you suffer 
from asthma.

Asthma is a chronic lung disease that is marked by
characteristics such as coughing, wheezing, shortness
of breath, and chest tightness.  Asthma tends to occur
with people who are genetically or environmentally
presdisposed to the condition.  

Some of the triggers that may start or make an attack
worse include exposure to allergens, viral respiratory
infections, airway irritants, exercise, and exposure
to things such as dust mites or cockroaches.

You can prevent asthma attacks by doing the following:
	1.  Bathe your pets weekly.
	2.  Don't smoke or permit smoking in your
home.	
	3.  When mold or pollent counts are high,
you should stay inside with air conditioning.
	4.  Wash your bedding and any stuffed toys 
at least once per week in hot water.
	5.  Wash your hands every chance you get.
	6.  Get a flu shot.
	7.  Wear a scarf over your mouth and nose in
the winter months.
	8.  Be proactive and know your triggers and 
how you should avoid them.

Now that you know what you know about asthma, you 
may be wondering where exercise fits in.  As most
doctors will tell you, you shouldn't give up on
sports or exercise at all.  You just have to be
smart about how you play and take special pre
cautions to avoid attacks.

Almost all doctors agree that the best way to 
prevent attacks during exercise is to keep your 
inhaler and medication close by.  You should never
use the inhaler more than 3 times during a game
or exercise session.  If you are up the previous 
night with coughing and wheezing, it's always best
to go light with your exercise the next day.

For something known as IEA (Exercise Induced Asthma),
the symptoms are somewhat different, in the fact
that they appear after 6 - 10 minutes of exercise
and will often be worse in cold or dry air.

If you have IEA, there are several activities that
you can enjoy such as swimming, walking, biking,
downhill skiing, and team based sports.  There are
many activities for you to choose from, to ensure
you get the exercise you need as well.

Keep in mind that the condition of asthma isn't 
"all in your head", it is a real physiological 
medical treatment that will require treatment to
prevent and treat.  Even though your doctor will
be your best friend in treating asthma, you are
the one who can prevent your symptoms.  

Always be smart, take your medication, and be
proactive.  Don't let it put you in a life of 
misery - as you can enjoy exercise just like
everyone else.
