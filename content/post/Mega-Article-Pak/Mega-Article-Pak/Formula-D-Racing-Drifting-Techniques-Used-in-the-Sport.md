Formula D Racing:  Drifting Techniques Used in the Sport

Have you ever watched a Formula D race before?  Formula D Racing, also commonly referred to as Formula Drifting, is a sport that is rapidly increasing in popularity in the United States.  Although the first professional event took place in 2004 in the United States, the sport has been popular for a number of years, especially in other areas of the world.  However, as previously mentioned, Formula Drifting is increasing in popularity in the United States. For that reason, there is a good chance that you are a fan of the sport.  If you are not, you will likely become one, sometime in the future.  If this is the case, you will want to learn as much as you can about the sport.

When it comes to learning about Formula D Racing, there are a lot of things that you may be wondering about.  Many individuals wonder why it is considered a form of racing, especially when not all events are termed as head-to-head events.  Others want to learn more about the cars, other want to learn about the sport in general, and there are some who want to know more about drifting. 

See, in Formula D Racing, drifting is essential; it is how many drivers are judged for their performance.  Drifting is defined as intentionally allowing a car to go past the car tires adhesion.  This results in a slip, known as a laterally slip. That slip causes the car to drift or, in a way, turn into a position that is hard to control.  Despite being hard to control, professional drifting drivers are almost always able to gain and keep control of their car.  

With drifting, there are a number of different techniques that are used.  According to the professional Formula Drifting Championship, these techniques include a Kansei Drift, a Braking Drift, and E-Brake Drift, and a Long Slide Drift.  Below is a simple explanation of each of the above mentioned drifting techniques. Although they look neat in writing, they are even better when seen live, in action.  

The Kansei Drift is to be used only with a neutrally balanced car.  Using another car will not only result in an unsuccessful drift, but it could also be dangerous.  When the correct car is used, the driver will remove his foot from the car’s throttle.  This will help to create an over steer, which the driver much manage throughout the rest of the high speed corner.  

A braking drift, unlike the above mentioned Kansei Drift, is mostly used in corners that are defined as low or medium speed corners.  Once in a low or medium speed corner, a driver will use their tail breaking, as soon as they begin entering into the corner. The use of this breaking will often result in the loss of grip, from the car to the car tires. To successfully maneuver this drifting technique, like all others, the driver must be able to balance the car through the use of the throttle and steering.

An E-Bake Drift, is in a way, similar to the above mentioned breaking drift; however, it can only be used in professional drifting under certain circumstances.  E-Brake drifting involves the use of a car’s emergency break.  It helps to create a loss of traction, which is important in drifting.  As with all other forms of drifting, the driver must successfully be able to maneuver the car once it begins to lose traction and control.

In addition to in an E-Brake Drift, the emergency brake is also used in another drifting technique.  That technique is known as a Long Slide Drift.  A Long Slide Drift involves activating a car’s emergency break on a straightaway.  It starts to angle the car in a direction that is needed to successfully make it through a number of corners.  It has been noted that the Long Slide Drift is only safe to be used when at a high speed.  Not only will the drifting technique not work at a low speed, but it is also potentially dangerous.  

The above mentioned drifting techniques are just a few of the many that are used in the sport.  Additional techniques include, but are not limited to a Faint Drift, a Clutch Kick Drift, a Shift Lock Drift, and a Dirt Drop Drift.
