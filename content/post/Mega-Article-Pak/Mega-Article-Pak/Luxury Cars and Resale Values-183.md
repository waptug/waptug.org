Luxury Cars and Resale Values

When it comes to ultra-luxury, high-end vehicle leasing, there is no doubt 
that the best deals are those cars that hold their value. With this in 
mind, we single out a few truths about residual values that consistently 
apply to high-end leasing.

The most determining factor when it comes to resale values is public 
perception of the brand, not its reliability ratings in quality surveys. 
Take the Jaguar for example: it is consistently rated as a quality car, but
because of questionable reliability perception among the public, it takes a 
sharp dip in value at the end of its lease-term 

Higher-tech options and other cutting-edge features do not necessarily mean 
the car will fare better.  By the time your car is two years old, better 
and cheaper systems will render the laser-guided cruise control, navigation
systems and built-in cell phone obsolete. Look for functional features, 
such as automatic transmissions, power windows and wheel-drive to enhance 
the vehicle’s value in the used-car market. 

Used-car buyers view less favorably luxury vehicles that come with big 
incentives. These are perceived as questionable in quality and 
reliability.
