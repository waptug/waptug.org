The Great Vacuum Cleaner

A vacuum cleaner is an absolute must have home
appliance these days.  All of us rely on our vacuum
cleaner to help keep our homes free of dirt and dust,
although how we go about it sometimes, doesn't 
give a lot of thought as to how efficient the
vacuum cleaner really is.

Before electric vacuums were created, home cleaning
was a tedious task.  Back then, floors had to be
cleaned with brushes, mops, and brooms.  Rugs and
carpets had to be removed from the floor, hung up
outdoors, and beaten to get the dust out.  Doing
things this way involved a lot of time and effort
and caused many health complaints.

The earlier inventions of non electric floor cleaning
devices made home cleaning much easier.  People
started to look for ways to improve on the efficiency
of these machines, which caused all types of 
contraptions to be invented.

Throughout the 100 year history of the vacuum cleaner,
there have been all sorts of improvements.  The
very first electric vacuums were created in the
early 1900s.  In 1908, the Hoover Company built
the first electric vacuum cleaner that used a cloth
filter bag and cleaning attachments as well.

During the years that followed, many different
designs and models were created, each one varying
in weight, size, suction power, performance, and
other features.  With all of the designs that came
out, the upright vacuum cleaner remained to be the
most popular.

The latest upright vacuums that are available today
will make cleaning a whole lot easier.  They are 
very light and versatile, and come in both bagged
and bagless designs.  They also include tools that
will help you remove dust from drapes, upholstery,
and even get tricky and hard to reach places.

By owning a bagless vacuum, you won't ever have
to buy vacuum bags again.  When it comes time to
empty the dirt container, you can empty it right
into your garbage can.  

You'll want to do this out in your yard or on the
street in order to prevent the dust from getting
back into your house.  If you suffer from allergies,
it's best to stay with a bagged unit.  With bagged
vacuum cleaners, the dust will stay in a sealed
bag and then when it gets full, you can easily 
dispose of it without being exposed to dust.

When you buy a vacuum cleaner, it's very important
to choose the best vacuum that will fit your home
cleaning needs.  You'll also need to think about
carpets and rugs, hard floors, even stairs before
you purchase your vacuum.  This way, you'll be
able to get the right vacuum with the right
accessories for the job - which will save you a lot
of time and effort when the time comes to clean your
home.
