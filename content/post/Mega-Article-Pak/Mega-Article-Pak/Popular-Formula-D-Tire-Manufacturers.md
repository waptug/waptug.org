Popular Formula D Tire Manufacturers

Sport fans tend to follow the sponsors of their favorite team or player. The same can be said with auto racing; the only difference is that these players are referred to as drivers.  In fact, with auto racing, this is most commonly seen with NASCAR. It has been said that NASCAR has the largest group of loyal fans.  Fans not only support the sponsors of their favorite drivers, but they also tend to purchase merchandise or services from them.  The same can be said with Formula Drifting.

Formula Drifting is a sport that is relatively new to the United States.  Despite the fact that the first professional event was held in 2004, the sport still has quite the fan following. Like many NASCAR fans, these fans are loyal.  That is why a large number of sponsors, also commonly referred to as product manufacturers have made the decision to become involved with the sport. When it comes to Formula D, the sponsors that most often first come to mind are tire manufacturers.  

Tire manufacturers do not just get their name on a driver’s uniform, but they also provide that driver with tires. With Formula D, the tires used are extremely important. In fact, to create a drift the tires need to loose tractions with the ground.  This essentially helps to create the perfect drift. Since tires are so important to the sport of drifting, there are a large number of tire manufacturers who have inserted themselves into the sport.  In fact, it has been noted that Formula D has the most tire manufacturer sponsors of any other motor sport; which includes NASCAR.

Nitto Tire is one of the many tire manufacturers that is involved with Formula Drifting.  This manufacturer, like many other tire manufacturers, makes tires for all different vehicles and all different driving conditions.  While they are well known for their tires for traditional vehicles, such as cars, SUV, and trucks, Nitto Tire is most well known for its racing tires.  One of these tires includes the NT 555 RII.  This type of tire is used primarily with road racing and other competitive sports, such as Formula D.

BF Goodrich Tire is another tire manufacturer that participates in Formula Drifting. This tire manufacturer is one of the most well known manufacturers in the United States. As with Nitto Tires, BG Goodrich Tires has a wide variety of different tires, available for all different uses.  When it comes to sports cars and Formula Drifting, quite a few BF Goodrich Tires are ideal for the sport.

Maxxis Tires, another sponsor and tire manufacturer involved in Formula D, is also a well known tire manufacturer. Although they are not as well known to most everyday individuals, they are well known to those involved in auto sports, such as auto racing or Formula Drifting. In fact, most of Maxxis Tire’s focus is placed on auto sports, including Formula Drifting.

Perhaps, out of all of the tire manufacturers and sponsors, for Formula Drifting, Bridgestone is the most well known.  Bridgestone’s tires are not only used in Formula D, but other motor sports as well. These additional sports include, but are not limited to, Formula 1, supercross racing, and monster truck racing.  Bridgestone is not just popular among racing, but it is a company that is known by just about everyone. In fact, there is even a chance that you have Bridgestone tires on your personal vehicle.  

In addition to the above mentioned tire manufacturers, Toyo Tires, Falken Tires, Cooper Tires, and Dunlop Tires are also Formula D sponsors. To add interest or extra excitement to your next Formula D event, keep an eye on the tires being used.  While all of these tire manufacturers come highly recommended, you will often find that the tires used makes all the difference in the world.
