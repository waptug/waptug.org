The Process Of Manufacturing Wine

Wine, which is a drink we all know and love, is produced from fruits such as grapes and berries by drying and then fermenting them.  Once the fruits ferment, the sugar within the fruit will turn into alcohol.  The wine will display a different color, taste, and aroma depending on the type of fruit that it was made from.  

Wine is divided into three main categories - fortified, sparkling, and table.  Wine is known as fortified when a bit of brandy is added into it to enrich the alcohol.  Wine is deemed as sparkling when it has the right level of C02.  Table wine, the third category, is wine in it’s natural form - which is different from any other type of wine.

Normally, grapes are the preferred ingredients for making wine.  They contain an equal amount of acid and sugar, which can’t be found in any other type of fruit.  When drying the grapes, a high amount of heat is needed.  To use grapes with wine though, you need to know the exact harvest season.  If you don’t pick the grapes during the right time, your wine will suffer due to the level of increases in sugar and a lack of acidic extent.

During the beginning stages of wine making, the grapes or other fruit is crushed by a large cylindrical container that will deflate the juicy parts of the fruit into large bags that are attached to the machine.  Next, the juicy part of the fruit is fermented through the use of heat.  During this part of the process, present yeast will help to convert the sugar into alcohol.  Once the sugars start to break down into alcohol, the wine will get a buttery flavor.

Next, is the settling.  Settling involves the yeast cells or any other type of material flowing near the top of the wine.  Once it is at the top, it is then filtered with all sediments being gathered on the filter.  Aging is next, which is where the wine is tightly packed away in special contains that won’t allow any contact with air for months - sometimes even years.  Once the wine has been aged, it is transferred into smaller bottlers then shipped out and sold.

When the wine is bottled, it is done in a way that makes it easy to distinguish the several types of wine.  Colored bottles are preferred, as they will greatly reduce the risk of oxidation, damage, and several other possible risks.  The bottles are also labeled according to their manufacturer and brand as well, which makes it easy for you to select the wine you are interested in.

Once you have bought a bottle fo wine, you should always make sure you store it in the right place.  The most appropriate places to store wine is the basement, underground cellars, or anywhere else that is damp and cool.  No matter where you store your wine at, you should always make sure that temperature stays around 55 degrees F.  

Never store the wine in an area where the temperature fluctuates, as it can harm the wine.  A humidity level of around 60% is also important, in order to keep the cork moist.  If the temperature is too low, it can also harm the wine.  When you buy your wine, you should always make sure that you store it in the right location.  Wine that is properly stored and taken care of can be truly amazing once you drink it - making it more than worth the time and effort.
