Professional Wart Removal:  Often Covered by Insurance

Do you have medical insurance, also commonly referred to as health insurance? If you do, you are lucky; not everyone is covered by health insurance.  Since you are lucky enough to have health insurance, it is advised that you take advantage of it.  This often means going to the doctor, whenever you need to, including whenever you need to have one or more of your warts removed.

Having a wart removed by a doctor is often deemed a professional wart removal.  Professional wart removal is performed by many primary care physicians, as well as by many dermatologists. Primary care physicians, also commonly referred to as family physicians, are doctors that tend to deal with their patients on a regular basis. On the other hand, dermatologists are healthcare professionals that specialize in skin conditions.  Depending on the type of skin condition in question, most dermatologists only deal with their patients on an as needed basis.

Perhaps, the best part about having your warts professional removed is, well, that they are being professionally removed.  The only downside is that, depending on who you go to, it can be quite expensive to have your warts removed by a doctor or a dermatologist; that is unless you have health insurance. If you have health insurance, there is a good chance that it is provided to you by your employer.  If your health insurance is not provided to you, you may have purchased it on your own. Whether you outright pay for your own health insurance or not, there is a good chance that it covers wart removals.

Although there is a good chance that your health insurance covers wart removal, it is still a good idea to check. You can easily do this by contacting your health insurance company. On the back of your insurance card, there should be a customer service number.  By calling that number, you should be able to speak with a representative who could outline what services are and are not covered by your health insurance.  In addition to speaking directly with a company representative, you may also be able to obtain the same information online.  Most health insurance companies have online websites. Those online websites can, in most cases, be personalized to include information on your coverage plan.

In addition to determining whether or not your health insurance coverage includes wart removal, it is also important to determine whether or not the doctor of your choice accepts your insurance.  You can do this by contacting your dermatologist or primary healthcare provider. They should be able to tell you weather or not your insurance coverage is accepted at their office. In addition to contacting a physician directly, you could also obtain the same information from your health insurance company. In fact, your health insurance company should be able to provide you with a list of local physicians, a list that would give you the ability to choose your own healthcare provider.

If you are reading this article, there is a good chance that you do have health insurance; however, there is always the possibility that you don’t. You can still have your warts professionally removed, even if you do not have health insurance coverage. Depending on where you live, you may be able to either find a primary care physician or a dermatologist who would be willing to workout a payment plan with you. That payment plan may make it affordable, overtime, for you to have your unwanted warts professionally removed.
