History of Microbrews

Many historians believe that the ancient Sumerians
and Mesopotamians were brewing as early back as 
10,000 B.C.  Even though this product would have
been different from the bottles varieties of today,
it would have still been recognizable.

The ancient Egyptians and the Chinese brewed their
beer, as did civilizations in America, where they
used corn instead of barley.  Back then, thousands
of years ago, microbrews were very popular and 
on their way to what we now know and love today.

In the middle ages, European monks were the 
guardians of literature and science, as well as
the art of making beer.  They refined the process
to perfection, and even institutionalized the use
of hops as both flavoring and a preservative.  

It wasn't however, until Louis Pasteur came along
that a final, important development was determined.
Until this time, brewers had to depend on the wild
yet airborne yeast for fermentation.  By establishing
that yeast is actually a living organism, he opened
the gates for controlling the conversion of sugar
into alcohol.

Grapes grow well in warmer climates, while barley
grows better in cool climates.  This is how the 
northern areas of Germany and England first became
famous for their beers.  

Beer in America
Everything in America went dim until the dark day
of 1920, when prohibition took effect.  A lot of 
breweries went out of business or switched their
production to soda pop.  Not everyone stopped
drinking, but gangster related products weren't
known for high quality.

When Franklin D. Roosevelt became president, he
quickly appealed the very unpopular law.  The
new breeds of now famous beer came after World War
2 were generally mass produced and very bland.
