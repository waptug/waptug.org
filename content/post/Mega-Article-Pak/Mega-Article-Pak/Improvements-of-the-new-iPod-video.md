Improvements of the new iPod video

	
The improvements of the new iPod video concern not only the dimensions, but also the battery life, the quality sound and, above all, the possibility of watching the favorite music videos and TV shows.
	
As regarding the exterior aspect, one may say that this may be the most handsome model of an iPod even made – a bigger display, thinner, and about 45 percent less space than the original iPod. The main idea is less space and more features and if it wasn’t the case of a human made object, you may have said that the magic is called evolution. The two models of the video iPod – 30 and 60 GB – are thinner and look very fashionable, having an attractive exterior aspect. 
	
The new iPod has other improvements, especially in the case of the battery life so that the enjoyment and satisfaction would be complete, having five hours life more than before. This means that the new iPod has 20 hours of battery life and taking into account the advantage of watching music videos, TV shows, cartoons, photos and other videos, this aspect is more than welcomed.
	
The improvements also concern the memory of the new iPod and the good news is that you may have 15,000 songs on it and even a full-color album up to 25,000 photos. The 2.5-inch color display is also of great help while watching either the photos or the videos. In this way, you may take all your favorite music with you and you may still have room for your favorite music videos, TV shows or cartoons. If you are a fan of the latest ABC hits like “Lost” and “Desperate Housewives”, you may also take them with you, as even this thing is possible with the new iPod video. There are also Pixar shorts and some Disney available for the new iPod for your children or for your childish tastes. 
	
Some other improvements regard the quality of changing the options and the touch-sensitive surface is the great achievement for the new iPod video. In this way, you may access the music, video and photo memory easily and you may also create a rating for your favorites. The options of play and pause, fast-forward and rewind are not a problem anymore. You may even launch slideshows with your favorite photos.
	
You may also benefit from the iTunes Music Store with over 2 million songs available for all tastes and ages, 2,000 videos, ABC or Disney TV shows. You may downlowd them and then sync them into your iPod. Besides, with the help of special cables you may see the photos or the videos on your TV set. There is another option for all these activities - you may use the universal dock and the remote control.
	
These amazing improvements may be the source of endless joys and satisfaction for you on the road or in other situations when you need company. Besides, you may also look up an e-mail address, you may check the calendar of your activities, find out the time in another part of the country or particular city. These possibilities may conquer the heart of any person in this world and that is why the new iPod video may be a great choice for a gift for the beloved ones. 
      
Moreover, this special toy may fit any age and any tastes and may be the perfect gift for any member of your family. The handy options, the nice design and great improvements may be the source of endless joys for any person who doesn’t like to spend time with no activity. The wide and bright screen, the touch-sensitive surface, the longer battery life, the great amount of options and possibilities make the new iPod video the best iPod ever made. And there is still room for other important and interesting changes, and that is why the designers are open to any useful suggestions.
