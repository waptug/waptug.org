Tips on Making Money on eBay, Not Losing It

Are you interested in becoming an eBay seller or are you a relatively new eBay seller?  If so, you may still be learning the ins and outs of eBay. Selling on eBay is a great way to make money on the side or even enough to support yourself, but you have to be successful at what you do.  Unfortunately, it can take time to fully learn the ins and outs of eBay, particularly how to become a profitable eBay seller, until now.  Below some helpful tips are outlined; tips that you won’t necessarily find explained on eBay.

eBay sellers are all required to pay fees to list their items for sale on eBay.  You are charged two separate fees, a listing fee or insertion fee and a final value fee.  For the final value fee, you are charged a percentage of the price that your item sold for.  The insertion fee or listing fee is figured out a little bit differently.  Instead of being charged a percentage, you are charged a set amount. For instance, at the current moment, it costs .20 to list an item up to .99 cents and .40 to list an item for sale between $1.00 and $9.99, and the fee scale continues up in a similar fashion.  Please remember that this is just a sample.  eBay regularly changes their fees; therefore, you are urged not to rely on the aforementioned fee samples.

Although eBay sellers must pay the eBay fees mentioned above, many do not take the time to thoroughly understand those fees.  You are advised against doing that, as it may end up costing you money.  For instance, many of the price ranges for eBay’s insertion fee scale ends at .99 cents.  For you, this is a great opportunity to save money, but you must know how to do so.  As stated above, if you list one of your items at $9.99, the sample insertion fee would be only .40 cents.  Did you know that if you listed your item for $10.00, your insertion fee could jump up to around .60 cents!  An extra .20 cents just for a penny is pretty expensive, especially if you list a number of eBay auctions that way.  Before listing items for sale on eBay again, examine eBay insertion fee sale and see how you can easily save money, sometimes by just shaving a few cents off your asking price. 

It has often been said that to be a successful eBay seller, you need to have good product descriptions and clear digital pictures of the item or items that you are selling.  Of course, having a number of pictures in your eBay listings is a great way to increase your chances of making a sale, but it can be expensive doing so.  eBay allows sellers to post one picture for free.  Additional pictures can be purchased for a small fee, but that small fee can add up overtime.  For that reason, many eBay sellers limit the number of pictures they put in their auctions; however, you do not want to do this. Instead, you will want to examine photo sharing sites.  Photo sharing websites, like PhotoBucket are a nice, fee way to add more pictures to your eBay auctions.  Register with a photo sharing site, like PhotoBucket, follow the instructions and you should be saving money in no time at all.

The above mentioned ways are just a few of the many ways that you can save money on eBay, not lose it.  In all honesty, you should do a little bit of research first.  Using the internet is a great way to research selling on eBay, as many other eBay users will share their money making secrets with you, free of charge.
