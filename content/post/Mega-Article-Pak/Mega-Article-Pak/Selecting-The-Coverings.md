Selecting The Coverings

Many factors play a role in selecting the right
covering for your window.  The main reasons as to
why you should install window coverings are light
control and privacy.  Other factors include 
durability, life expectancy, cleaning, formality,
versatility, safety, and the price.

Light control
The most difficult factor to control is light, 
with most window coverings falling into one of
five categories:
	1.  Transparent - Clear, without obstruction
	2.  Translucent - Diffused light, which 
prevents the perception of distinct images
	3.  Filtered - Muted light in bright 
conditions
	4.  Semi-Opaque - Surfaces imprenetrable
by light, yet it also allows some light through
the gaps
	5.  Opaque - This is where all light is
blocked

Privacy
Privacy can be best achieved with almost any type
of window covering.  The window treatment simply
needs to be translucent or better to diffuse 
images.  Frosted glass or glass block can even 
help to give adequate levels of privacy.

Durability
A window opening by nature is a harsh environment
that is subject to direct sunlight, humidity, and
even temperatures.  Add these factors to frequent
use and its simple to understand why windows
need to be constructed well.  The life expectancy
is normally less for fabric window treatment
that can fade with time.  Solid coverings, such
as shutters, have a long life span.

Cleaning
Each and every window covering will collect dust
and dirt.  Fabric coverings are the most difficult
to clean, and are subject to stains.  The 
furniture quality window coverings will normally
wipe clean with a light solution.

Versatility
Some coverings will work well in formal settings,
while others will work best in casual living 
settings.  Alternate styles are versatile and
blend in well with almost any style of room.

Safety
Small children in the home will usually come in
contact with windows and their coverings.  Some
coverings will have cords to raise or lower
for better visibility.  Although they are handy
to have, they can be dangerous if they come
within reach of a child.

Price
While there is a discrepancy in the costs of
window coverings, it's very important to weigh
the overall value involved.  The term "value"
is often overused, although when purchasing 
long term household items it is necessary to
consider the return on the investment.

Window coverings on the low end of the price
spectrum will normally have a short life
expectancy and low durability.  The higher 
priced coverings, such as shutters, are designed
to last the life of the home - all while 
retaining the original character.

Shutters offer a hard window covering that is
semi opaque when closed, although they provide
great visibility when opened.  The furniture
quality wooden shutters can be either painted
or stained in order to meet the needs of most
decors.  All shutters are extremely durable
and offer a long life span.
