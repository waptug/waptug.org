Eating Healthy On A Budget

If you have problems serving healthy foods because
of the prices, you'll find these tips to be just
what you need to eat healthy on a budget.

1.  Eliminate junk food
Doing your shopping on your own is the easiest way
to shop, as children and sometimes spouses are 
usually the ones requesting junk food.  Shopping
alone will prevent this, and ensure that you only
buy the foods you need.

2.  Water or milk instead of soft drinks
You can still enjoy your favorite drinks at a 
sporting event or night out, although you should
stick with the smallest size when shopping to save
money and calories.  Children and even adults need
milk or milk products on a daily basis.  Milk will
also help you get strong and provides calcium for
healthy bones and healthy teeth.

3.  Buy fruits in quantity
Whne they are in season, buy fruits in quantity
and freeze any extras.  You can buy several pounds
this way, and freeze extras to have them when the
fruit goes out of season.  Wash the fruit well, 
remove any spoiled pieces, dry thoroughly, then
freeze in plastic zipper bags.

4.  Meats and beans
Meats and beans are the best sources for protein.
Lean meat is more expensive than meats with a lot
of fat.  Canned beans are a great deal as well,
as they give you protein at a great price.

5.  Beans as a substitute
You should use beans a substitute for meat on a
frequent occasion.  There are several varieties, 
so you can prepare them in a crock pot, so when 
you return home they are ready to consume.

The USDA recommends eating beans at least 4 times
per week.  If you experience gas after eating 
beans you should try washing them, covering them
with water, bringing the water to a boil, then
draining it off and refilling the pot.  

6.  If you live in a coastal area or an area 
where fish are around, make that an integral
part of your diet.  You can catch them from the
lakes or rivers, saving money in the process.

7.  Peanut butter is great for those on a budget
as it's popular with almost everyone.  You can 
use it for sandwiches instead of eating hot 
dogs.  It does need to be refrigerated, although
bigger jars can last you for weeks.

8.  You should fill up with foods that have a high
content of water.  Watermelon, salads, and even 
sugar free gelatin are all great examples.  

Eating healthy is always something you can't go 
wrong with.  You can eat healthy for just a few
bucks, which makes it perfect for those on a 
budget. Now, you don't need a lot of money to have
the lifestyle and health you've always wanted.
