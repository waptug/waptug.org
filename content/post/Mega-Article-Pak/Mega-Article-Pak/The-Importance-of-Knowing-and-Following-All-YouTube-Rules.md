The Importance of Knowing and Following All YouTube Rules

Are you interested in joining the YouTube community?  If you are, you will need to register for a free YouTube membership account. To register, you need to fill out a short form, which will ask you a few personal questions. In a matter of minutes, you can be on your way to rating or reviewing the YouTube videos you watch or even uploading your own videos!  How fun does that sound?

Although YouTube is a lot of fun, whether you are only interested in watching videos or if you want to upload your own, YouTube, like all other online websites, has a number of rules and restrictions.  It is not only important that you know those rules, but that you follow them, as there are a number of consequences for not.  Just a few of the rules enforced on YouTube are outlined below.

If you are only interested in watching YouTube videos, not necessarily uploading your own, you will find that there are less rules and restrictions for you.  One of the most common rules surrounds registering for a free YouTube account.  Only a minimal amount of personal information is asked of you, like your name, country, zip code, birth date, and gender, but you are advised to be truthful.  Also, there is no need for you to create multiple YouTube accounts.  Should you forget your YouTube login information, you should be able to follow YouTube’s instructions to retrieve your YouTube sign in name, as well as your password.

Another rule that many YouTube video watchers have to follow concerns leaving comments on YouTube video pages or participating in the YouTube forums.  Whenever you leave comments for a YouTube video submitter, you are advised to use your best judgment.  Of course, you are able to leave negative feedback, if you want, but you are advised to do so in a tasteful matter.  You will want to avoid foul language and definitely do not threaten any other YouTube members.  Doing so, will likely not only get your message revoked, but you may also have your YouTube account suspended.

As it was previously mentioned, if you are planning on uploading videos to YouTube and sharing them with other internet users, you are more likely to find a larger number of rules to follow.  One of those rules involves the content of your video.  You are advised against posting content that is illegal in nature.  YouTube encourages you to use caution when making your videos, as you never really know who will be watching them. For instance, now many police departments are starting to use the internet to help them solve crimes. So, not only do you have to worry about online predators viewing your YouTube videos, but you also have to worry about law enforcement doing the same thing.

In connection with your YouTube video content, you also need to make sure that your video content is actually yours.  In recent times, there have been many instances where YouTube made it on the news for having a large number of copyright materials on their website.  This is illegal.  You will want to make sure that videos you post online were actually made by you.  Before using music clips, television clips, or movie clips, you need to get permission to do so. If you fail to get permission, you are, essentially, stealing someone’s work.  

The above mentioned rules are just a few of the many that you may be expected to follow when using YouTube.  As it was stated above, one consequence to violating the YouTube rules is having your account suspended.  If you submitted a video that went against YouTube’s guidelines, your video may be removed.  Should you be caught committing a crime, whether it be using drugs, drinking underage, or taping a robbery, you may also be prosecuted for your actions.  That is why, for your own safety and wellbeing, you not only need to know all of YouTube’s rules, but you also follow them at all times.
