La Jolla Shores

Located at 8200 Camino del Oro, La Jolla Shores is a
sandy beach around a mile long, adjacent to a 
residentual dwelling.  During the summer months, the
waves at this beach are normally the most gentle of
all San Diego beaches, although the rip currents can
be very strong at times.

For this very reason, novice scuba classes are held
at La Jolla Shores.  The grassy park of Kellogg
Park is located behind the main lifeguard station
and provides an excellent area for picnicking.  A
wide cement boardwalk parallels a large area of the
beach between the sand and the park.

The beach of La Jolla Shores is adjacent to the San
Diego La Jolla Underwater Ecological Reserve.  The
removal of objects from this area as well as fishing
are prohibited.  The Scripps Pier lies at the north
end of the beach, although the pier isn't open to
the public.  

Within the City limits, La Jolla Shores has the only
beachfront boat launch.  Small boats can be launched
directly into the surf at foot of Avenida de la Playa,
which is south of the lifeguard station.  This can
be a rough terrain area, so you may need to have
a four wheel drive vehicle.

If you like to surf, there are specified areas on
the beach where the waves tend to be small.  For
scuba diving, the south end of the beach is widely
used by scuba driving classes.  

During the summer months, La Jolla Shores can tend
be very crowded.  You should try to go in the morning,
as the crowds aren't as bad.  This is a great beach
during those hot summer days, with plenty to do
for your entire family.
