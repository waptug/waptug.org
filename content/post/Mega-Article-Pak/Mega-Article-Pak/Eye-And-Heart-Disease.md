Eye And Heart Disease

Eye disease is very common with Golden Retrievers.  Most Golden’s will generally have hereditary cataracts, which is a common eye problem.  At an early age, with affected Golden’s, one type of hereditary cataract will appear.  Even though it may not cause interference with the vision of the Golden Retriever, some dogs will progress into total and quite possibly severe loss of vision.

Sometimes, Golden Retrievers can get affected by non hereditary cataracts, although an examination by a board certified veterinarian can determine just how bad the cataracts really are.  If cataracts are indeed suspected with a Golden Retriever, then breeding won’t be recommended.  Breeding a Golden who has this condition can lead to serious problems, such as passing it on to the pups.

Several families of the Golden Retriever breed have been known to carry genes for CPRA (Central Progressive Retinal Atrophy), which affects the retina, and can result in permanent blindness for Golden’s at a young age.  There are other types of eye defects as well, such as retinal dysplasia, which prevents a Golden from breeding.

Trouble with both the eyelid and eyelashes are also a possibility with Golden Retrievers, with some being the result of hereditary factors.  The eyelids rotating in or out, or the eyelashes rubbing on or in the eye are both common problems with the breed.  Even though surgery can help to fix these types of problems, dogs that are experiencing this type of problem shouldn’t be allowed to breed nor compete in shows under any type of AKC rules.

You should always have your Golden Retriever checked annually for eye disease, as it can develop during any age.  When you take your Golden to have him examined for eye disease, you should have a veterinary ophthalmologist do the exam.  He has all of the necessary equipment, and the proper training needed to make sure that your dog gets the best examination possible.

Heart disease
SAS (Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis) is the most common and widespread form of heart disease within the entire Golden Retriever species.  Before you breed your Golden Retriever, you should always have him examined for heart disease by a certified veterinary cardiologist.  If the cardiologist detects a heart murmur, he will recommend additional tests for your dog.

In the event that the results prove negative, it doesn’t necessarily rule heart disease out, as some milder forms may still be present, although undetectable.  If a Golden Retriever is diagnosed to have any type of heart disease, he should not breed.  Breeding Golden Retrievers who have heart disease can lead to serious and sometimes fatal results.  To be on the safe side, you should always have your Golden tested for his disease before you plan on breeding.
