Aspen Nightlife – The Club Scene

After a day on the slopes in Aspen, Colorado, you 
are probably ready to do some partying. The Aspen 
club scene starts hopping shortly before the slopes 
close. Many of the clubs have planned events – and 
some are just free-for-alls with music and dancing all 
night long. No matter what kind of music you are into, 
you will find it in Aspen.

Most of the lodges and hotels in Aspen have bars or 
clubs. Some have multiple bars, clubs, or lounges – 
so start your search for Aspen nighttime 
entertainment at your lodge or hotel. You can 
usually find a friendly game of pool in almost any bar 
before the music and dancing begin. 

The easiest way to find the type of music and dancing 
that is most enjoyable to you is to pick up a copy of 
Aspen Magazine’s Traveler’s Guide. This guide will 
provide you with a list of Aspen hotspots, and let you 
know what you can expect at each club or bar. If you 
will be drinking, make sure that you don’t drive your 
car. Walk or take advantage of the public transportation 
or taxi services in the Aspen area.
