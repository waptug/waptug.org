A Lack Of Vitamins

Everyone knows that the human body needs a certain amount of vitamins and minerals everyday to function properly and remain healthy.

Those who don’t get enough of vitamins A, B1, and B2 for example, will always feel tired, along with a loss of appetite.  Other symptoms include mental and emotional stress, chapped lips, and other annoying or painful habits.  

The most common causes of deficiency include a poor diet, alcoholism, stress, a lack of vitamins, or medicine that interferes with your ingestion of vitamins.  If you are always feeling tired or feeling a lack of energy, you are probably short on the vitamins that your body needs to have on a daily basis.  If you visit your doctor and tell him the problem, he will probably recommend vitamins and supplements that will give you want you need.  Whatever you do, you should never overdo it and try to catch up on what you’ve been missing - as this will do you more harm than good.

Even though you may be following a healthy diet, you’ll still need to take vitamins and supplements.  No matter how healthy you eat, you should still use the right vitamins and supplements to give your body what it needs.
