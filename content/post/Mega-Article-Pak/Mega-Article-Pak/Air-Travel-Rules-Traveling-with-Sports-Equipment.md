Air Travel Rules:  Traveling with Sports Equipment

Are you an avid sports fan?  If so, there is a good chance that you will try and incorporate sports into your next vacation or business trip. If you are planning on enjoying a game of golf or a game of baseball, it is likely that you will want to bring along some sporting equipment with you.  However, did you know there are certain restrictions on those items?  If you are planning on traveling with sports equipment, not matter what sport that equipment is for, you are advised to familiarize yourself with these rules and restrictions.

As previously mentioned, golf is a sport that many travelers enjoy participating in.  If you are planning on traveling with your golf clubs, you will need to treat them as checked baggage. All airlines currently have a ban on golf clubs being used as carryon luggage.  Due to the cost of most golf club sets, you will either want to leave your clubs at home or properly protect them.  If you are traveling to a golf resort or other popular vacation destination, there is a good chance that you should be able to rent a set of golf clubs. Although they will not be your own, it is nice to know that your set is safe at home.

In addition to golf, baseball is another sport enjoyed by many.  Like golf clubs, baseball bats are banned from being used as carryon luggage.  If you are planning on enjoying a game of baseball, on your next vacation or business trip, you will want to store your baseball bats in a secure bag that can safely be transported through different airports.  While baseball bats are banned from airplane cabins, there is no mention of other equipment, such as cleats, helmets, or baseballs.  For your own convenience, you may want to store these other baseball supplies in the same place as your baseball bats, in your checked baggage.

Of course, if you are planning on enjoying a hunting excursion, when on vacation or a business trip, you will need to keep your supplies in your checked baggage.  All bows, arrows, and guns are strictly prohibited from being in airplane cabins. In fact, if you try and pass through a security checkpoint with these items, is there is a good chance that you will be detained by airport security, for further questioning. Although you may not necessarily think about it, bows, arrows, and guns are not only used for recreational purposes, but they are also used to harm others. 

Additional sporting goods that are banned from being included in your carryon luggage include pool cues, ski poles, lacrosse sticks, or hockey sticks.  As with all other items, if you are concerned with the safety of your sporting equipment, you are advised to rethink your decision to bring that equipment along.  You can help to protect your equipment by making sure that everything is properly and safely packaged; however, there are no guarantees.  You are also advised against relying on compensation from the airlines if and when your sports equipment suffers damage.  

As previously mentioned, there are some sporting goods that are outright banned, but other rules are not so clear.  If you are trying to decide whether or not you can pack other equipment in your carryon luggage, such as masks or other protective gear, you are advised to ask before heading out to the airport. In the event that these items are banned, you may have to make additional arrangements. Regardless of whether you choose to return the items to your car or mail them to your home, you may end up wasting unnecessary time and money.
