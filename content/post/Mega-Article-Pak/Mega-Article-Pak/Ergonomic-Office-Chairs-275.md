Ergonomic Office Chairs

Ergonomic office chairs should help you to increase
back and neck support and also help to improve your 
posture and help prevent slouching.  Many employees of
the office often experience back pain because they sit
in their chair for extended periods of time.  Doing 
this will increase stress in the spine, neck, arms,
shoulders, and even the legs.  By getting a chair 
that isn't ergonomically friendly, you could end up 
aggravating any existing conditions you may have.

The ergonomic chair you select should be an inch wider
or more than your hips or thighs on both sides of the 
chair.  The seat pan on the chair should be contoured 
for equal weight distribution and also to provide 
maximum comfort.  You should also make sure that your 
back arches against the chair, as this will help to 
prevent slumping.

A helpful feature to ergonomic office chairs is the 
adjustable height mechanism.  This can be a great essential
for busy office meeting rooms or conference rooms where 
different people use the same chairs.  Most chairs that
offer teh height mechanism will also allow you to fine
tune the back rest of the chair in all directions.  If
your chair doesn't have a back rest, you can simply use
a pillow or cushion to support your lower back.

All in all, ergonomic office chairs are ideal for those
who are at their desk extended periods of time.  These 
chairs don't cost a lot of money either, yet they will 
provide you a lot in terms of comfort and support.  If
your office is in need of office chairs, the ergonomic
chairs are definitely worth adding to your office.
