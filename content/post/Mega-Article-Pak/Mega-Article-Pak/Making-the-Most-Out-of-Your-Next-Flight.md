Making the Most Out of Your Next Flight

Are you planning on taking a vacation this year?  Whether you are vacationing alone, with your family, or with your romantic partner, it is almost a guarantee that you would want to enjoy your trip.  You can plan your vacation as much as you would like; however, there is a way that you could spoil your vacation, even before you get off the ground. That way is by having a bad experience at the airport or aboard your airplane. To prevent this from happening, you are advised to know how to make the most out of your next flight.  Doing so will help to ensure that your vacation is filled with joyous memories.

The first step in making the most out of your next vacation flight, it is to familiarize yourself with all of the air travel rules.  This most commonly includes items that are prohibited in airports and aboard airplanes.  Unfortunately, many individuals are unaware that many of the items in their carryon luggage are actually prohibited.  Bringing prohibited items aboard an airplane could lead to your items being confiscated, you missing your flight, or even being detained by airport security.  

The best way for you to go about learning what items are and are not allowed aboard an airplane is to review the restrictions that your airport and airline has. You can do this by contacting the airline or airport directly or by visiting their online websites. You should be able to find these websites by performing an internet search.  In your search, you will likely learn that a large number of items are banned. These items include, but are not limited to, most liquids, sharp objects, most sporting equipment, and flammable items.  It is also important to determine which of these items can be stored in your carryon luggage and which can be stored in your checked baggage, if any.

In addition to learning about the items that are prohibited aboard an airplane or past airport security checkpoints, you will also want to familiarize yourself with the general airport screening process.  Since there is always a chance that problems will arise, most airports request that you arrive, at least, two hours before your flight departs.  However, it may be a good idea to check with your airport first.  Since different airports have different flights and are different sizes, you may find that certain airports request that you arrive earlier than two hours.  

On the day that your flight leaves, it is important that you arrive on time.  If your airport recommends arriving two hours in advance, it is advised that you arrive two hours in advance.  Even if you get through security quicker than you imagined, the worst that will happen is that you will have to wait. If you arrive at the airport at the last minute, there is a chance that you may miss your flight.  It is also important that you follow all of the requests made by airport security.  If you are asked to step aside, you are advised to do so without incident. Often times, the matter, in which you were asked to step aside for, will clear up right away, but not if you are rude, insulting, or unruly.  

Perhaps, the best way to make the most out of your next flight is to cooperate with airport security.  In the event that you packed a banned item by mistake, just acknowledge your mistake and move on.  Your item will likely be confiscated, but it is better than the consequences, which may include a missed flight or being detained by airport security.
