Exercise And Harm

Anytime you exercise, your brain releases chemicals
known as endorphins that produce a feeling of euphoria,
which is known as "runners high", which is also very
easy to become chemically addicted to.

Without this rush, you'll feel irritable and out of
it until you exercise again.  Therefore, you'll go 
on exercising and not listen to what your body is 
actually telling you - which is to stop.

The main reason addicts will continue to push themselves
lies in what will happen when they don't work out.
Normally when they are unable to exercise, they will
display signs of depression, anxiety, confusion,
and be less happy with themselves.

Aches and pains
Over exercising doesn't only affect the mind, but the
body as well.  Exercise will initially do what it 
is intended to do, give you a fit body but once you
cross the line however, it can drastic. Muscle
damage, osteoarthritis, and heart problems will all
be waiting in the wings if you continue to overdo
it.  The body has limits and if you push beyond
that limit, you'll do nothing but harm yourself.

Obsessive exercise tends to happen among those who
are new to exercise.  Therefore, if you are keen
to reap the benefits of getting fit, you'll tend
to overstep the limits.

The initial signs of over exercise are exhaustion,
which can lead to a build up of fatigue.  Keep in
mind, it isn't only the muscles that are at risk,
but the bones as well.  Many people who exercise
push themselves to the point of injuries such as
shin splints or even stress fractures, then refuse
to rest, which causes greater and sometimes even
permanent damage.

Even a brisk walk in the morning doesn't come
without risk, as walking too much can lead to
osteoarthritis.  When you walk, you are working 
against gravity.  Even though you are exercising
your muscles, you are also harming your knee joints
as well.

Many people who walk up to an hour or more everyday
end up with complaints of aches in the knees.  The
fact is, jogging also harms the knees, and too
many sit ups can hurt as well.  As with any type
of exercise, moderation is the key.

You should always start off gradually, and combine
several different types of workouts, which is one
thing that obsessive exercisers forget to do.  One
of the biggest complication factors of people who
get addicted to exercise is that they will tend 
to perform the same workout each and every day,
which further increases the risk of permanent damage.

Think right
You should never work out to the point where you 
feel completely exhausted once you have finished.
Your limit with exercise should be 45 minutes to an
hour, four or five days a week.  When you are
finished, your workout should leave you feeling 
fresh and energetic.  Every week should make it a
point to take a day's break - as your body will
need to relax and rejuvenate.

The key to achieving this completely lies in your
attitude, as exercising is the way to a healthy
life.  If you do it only to please yourself, you'll
defeat the entire purpose when you stand there on
the weighing machine.  

If you take things one day at a time and don't 
over do it, you'll be well on your way to a healthy
body.  Exercising can be a lot of fun and a way
to relax, if you don't rush it.  Start off slow
and gradually work your way up.  Before you know it,
you'll know how to prevent injuries before they
happen and you'll know exactly what you need to
do to remain healthy.
