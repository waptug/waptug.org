Take a Disneyland Tour

No Disneyland Vacation can be complete without a 
Disneyland tour – especially if it is your first trip to 
Disneyland. There are currently four different tours 
to choose from, and Disneyland park admission is 
required for all tours. It is strongly advised that you 
make a reservation for the tours that you wish to go 
on.

Disneyland’s Discover the Magic Tour may be the 
most popular of the four. This tour will have you and 
your family working with Disneyland characters to 
find clues and hunt for treasure. You can literally live 
out a Disneyland fantasy with your family and loveable 
characters, outsmarting the Disney bad guys! This 
tour includes lunch and an exclusive gift that can only 
be obtained on this tour. 

The Discover the Magic Tour lasts for about three 
hours. There is a two ticket minimum, and the cost 
is $49 each of the first two tickets, with additional 
tickets costing $39. The tour is appropriate for the 
5 – 9 year old age group, and adults. The tour is 
not really suitable for children under the age of five, 
or for children who need strollers. 

The VIP Tour lasts for about four hours, and costs 
$75 per hour for a party of up to ten people. You 
must book this tour well in advance, or there will be 
an additional twenty dollar fee. The tour is not 
recommended for children, but is designed more for 
people who have a true love and interest in Disney 
and Disneyland history. 

The Welcome to Disneyland Tour is absolutely 
perfect for first timers. There are many benefits to 
this tour, including priority seating at one of the stage 
shows, tips and suggestions for getting the most out 
of your Disneyland vacation, a brief history of the 
park, priority seating at one of the many restaurants, 
instruction in using FastPass, two bonus FastPass 
tickets, and much more. This tour lasts about two 
and a half hours, and costs $25 per person.

A Walk in Walt’s Footsteps focuses on the vision of 
Walt Whitman, and is not really suitable for small 
children. Filled with history and trivia about the park, 
this tour lasts for more than three hours, and costs 
$49 per person. The main feature of this tour is your 
peek at the exclusive Club 33. 

Again, you should definitely consider making one of 
these tours part of your Disneyland experience – 
especially if this will be your first trip to Disneyland. 
You may see things and learn things that you would 
not see or learn without the benefit of the tour!
