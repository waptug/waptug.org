Cooking with Oils

Everyone knows the foods to eat that improve health,
although how we cook the food can be just as important.
With there being so many oils and butter products
claiming to be the best, it can be quite difficult
to know which ones to use and which ones to avoid.

1.  Canola oil
Canola oil is a popular oil, with many physicians 
claiming that it has the ability to lower the risk
of heart disease.  The oil is low in saturated fat,
high in monounsaturated fat, and offers the best 
fatty acid composition when compared to other oils.

You can use canola oil in sauting, as a marinade
and even in low temperature stir frying.  It has
a bland flavor, which makes it a great oil for foods
that contain many spices.  Unlike other oils, this
one won't interfere with the taste of your meal.

2.  Olive oil
olive oil offers a very distinct flavor with plenty
of heart healthy ingedients.  The oil is rich in
monounsaturated fat, helps to lower cholesterol 
levels and reduce risk of cancer.  It's also rich
in antioxidants and has a very long storage life.

Even though it can be used in cooking, it's the 
healthiest when uncooked, such as with a salad or
dipping sauce.  When you use it with cooking, you
should heat it on low to medium temperatures, making
sure to avoid high heat.

3.  Butter
Butter is one food that has been around for many,
many years.  Butter tastes good, and offers sources
of Vitamin A and other fat soluble vitamins such as
E, K, and even D.  Butter is also made from natural
ingredients and not chemically or artificially 
processed.

You can use butter with cooking, baking, or even as
a spread.  You can also pair it with creamy sauces,
marinades, baked dishes, or even bread.

4.  Margarine
Margarine was first introduced as an alternative to
high fat butter.  When it was first created however, 
it was loaded with trans fat, a substance that we 
now know raises bad cholesterol.

As a cooking oil, margarine tastes good, it's lower
in fat than most oils and butter, and it's quite 
easy to spread.  It's available in a variety of
different products and a good source of vitamin E.

When it comes to cooking with oils, there are 
several at your disposal.  There are many more than
what is mentioned here, although the ones above are
the most popular.  Eating healthy involves cooking
healthy food - which is where your cooking oil really
takes center stage.
