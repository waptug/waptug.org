What You Need For Your Pool

When summer arrives, it’s time to get cool and enjoy the fun of summer.  Like other homeowners, you may be thinking a swimming pool. Pools are great to have, although they require a lot of work and maintenance - whether you have an in ground or above ground swimming pool.  Before you rush out and buy your pool for summer, there are a few things you should know.

When you buy your pool, your dealer or salesman will more than likely go over what else you need with your pool.  In order to operate your pool, there are several things that you simply must have to get started.

The first thing you’ll need is a filtration system.  When you get your filtration system, make sure that your filtration system is capable of handling your pool capacity.  A filtration system is very important, as it helps to remove small partials and bacteria from building up in your water.

A vacuum is also important.  You should make sure however, that you purchase a vacuum that is specific for your swimming pool.  There are several types of vacuums available, and you want to make sure that you don’t purchase the wrong one.  Vacuums are essential to operating your pool, as they help to clean out debris settled on the bottom.

You should also make sure that you get a skimmer basket or strainer as well, as it helps with your vacuum and filtration system.  Skimmer baskets or strainers will keep your pool clean by catching debris and bugs that manage to get into your pool.  You should use them whenever you use your pool, as they will do a majority of the cleaning for you.

To protect your pool, you’ll also need a swimming pool cover.  Covers are available in a few different types, and several different sizes.  A cover will protect your pool from debris and elements, as well as preventing those you love from drowning.  You should always make sure that you buy a strong and sturdy cover, and be sure to use it to cover your pool when you aren’t swimming.

A maintenance chart is also important.  With a maintenance chart, you can keep track of what you have done to your pool, the level of chemicals that you are using, and the readings of the tests that you have performed on your water.  Maintenance charts are easily overlooked by pool owners, although they are essential to knowing what you have done to your pool.

Another important items you’ll need are chemicals.  They play a very important role in balancing your water, and helping swimmers stay healthy.  There are several different types of chemicals available, including chlorine, clarifier, and pH chemicals.  All types of chemicals are very important, and need to be used to keep your water levels healthy.  You can check your water and pH levels on a daily basis, as you do your regular pool maintenance.

In order to perform tests on your pool, you’ll need a testing kit.  They come in either strip or bottle form, and allow you to test and understand the different chemical levels in your water. If you are planning to keep your pool healthy, you’ll need to do tests.  They are easy to do, and won’t take you but a few minutes of your time.

To operate your pool and perform the proper maintenance, you’ll need to have the above equipment and supplies.  Although you can buy pool accessories such as toys and furniture, they aren’t required to use your swimming pool.  You don’t need to have any accessories - although you do need everything listed above.
