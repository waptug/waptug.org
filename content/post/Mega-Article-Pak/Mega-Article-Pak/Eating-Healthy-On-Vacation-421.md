Eating Healthy On Vacation

It can be very tempting to abandon your good sense
of healthy eating on vacation.  Although you may
strive for healthy eating, it's easy to drift off
and grab an ice cream cone here and there.  There
are however, ways to watch what you eat on 
vacation.

It's easier than ever these days to request a low
fat or vegetarian meal on airplane flights.  If 
you choose to instead drive to your destination, 
the quest to find healthy food can get a bit more
complicated.

Rather than simply relying on greasy foods for
nutrition, pack some nutritious foods in a cooler
full of ice packs.  Fruits and vegetables, crackers,
yogurt, and sandwiches are all great to have with 
you on the road.  

Once you arrive at your hotel, you should do 
yourself a favor and turn the minibar key down - as
this helps to avoid the temptation.  If your hotel
offers a continental breakfast, stick to fruits,
cereals, and proteins.  If your hotel has a stove
or microwave, consider bringing your own healthy
food with you.

If you simply must eat out, do so only when you 
are hungry.  Restaurants will usually serve large
portions, so be careful.  If you do go a bit over
on a meal, simply cut back on the next.  

If you find it hard to fit in three square meals
a day, try to fit in six smaller meals or snacks,
as your body needs fuel every four hours or so.
When you eat out, avoid appetizers.  Whatever you
do, do not miss any meals.

When it's possible, you should avoid eating large
meals at night.  When your body gets ready for 
sleep and slows down, it also burns calories at a
much slower pace.  Never eat bread before bed, and
make sure to avoid the butter.  Choose fish or
poultry for your meal instead, and include 
vegetables as a side dish.  

Even though it may sound hard, eating healthy on
vacation isn't really that difficult.  All you have
to do is use a little will power, and pass up
foods that you know aren't good for you.  This
way, you'll enjoy healthy eating and a healthy
lifestyle wherever you go.

The next time you go on a vacation, always remember
that eating healthy is a way of life.  You can 
afford to get something you crave, although you
shouldn't make a habit of it.  One ice cream 
cone or a pizza isn't going to matter - as long as
you know when to stop.
