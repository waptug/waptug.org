Supercross motorcycle racing, as you likely already know, is racing that occurs on a man-made track or surface, with off-road motorcycles.   In a way, that track is compared to an obstacle course.

With supercross motorcycle racing, the goal of the race is to not only make it through the tough course, but to finish first. This goal typically takes place in the final feature, often known as the main event; however, the main event is not all that supercross motorcycle racing has.

As with many other forms of racing, including professional stockcar racing, supercross motorcycle racing using qualifying races and heat races. Qualifying races are often used to determine which supercross racers can participate in the main event. This is important because supercross motorcycle racing is not just popular with fans.  There are many men and women out there who wish to become a professional supercross racer; therefore, many supercross racing events tend to have a fairly large driver turn out.  While it is not always the case, most of the time, only a certain number of drivers qualify for each race.

Once all of the qualifying racings have taken place, many supercross racers then participate in heat races.  Heat races are sometimes substituted for qualifying races, especially during amateur supercross motorcycle races.

During this time, racers will compete for first place; however, supercross motorcycle racing is not like most other forms of racing.  As previously stated, supercross race tracks are man-made tracks with numerous jumps, small hills, and other obstacles. In addition to coming in first place, racers must also successful maneuver the course.  Although this may seem easy, it isn’t always.  This is because the racing is often done in close corridors, making it even harder to maneuver around the track.

Although reading about it in print may seem interesting enough, there is nothing like seeing a supercross motorcycle race in action.
