Diesel Or Not

Diesel is often looked at as being smelly, noisy, and
many think the only place for it is in a tractor.  The
truth to diesel vehicles is that they are slow, noisy,
smelly, although they are cheaper to run than gas. 

Diesel engines aren't as powerful as gas engines, as
gas engines produce more horsepower than that of a
diesel engine.  Diesel vehicles however, offer more
torque than gas.  Therefore, it is a very thin line as
to which one is better.  

When it comes to power, diesel is the more expensive
of the two.  Diesel powered vehicles are normally more
expensive to buy than gas, and the parts are a lot
more expensive than gas vehicles.  The diesel however,
is more reliable due to it being less complicated
internally and heavier to build, therefore it normally
lasts longer than gas engines.

Economy is always a factor as well, as will fuel
prices being what they are.  Now days, it costs a
small fortune to fill up a gasoline vehicle, especially
the bigger engines.  When it comes to fuel, diesel
is generally less expensive.  You can fill up a diesel
vehicle for less of a price, and the fuel will
normally go longer than gas will.

Appearance is also important.  Diesel is generally
loud, with the exhaust emitting black smoke when the
vehicle is throttled.  You can normally tell when a 
diesel pulls off by the black smoke it leaves behind.
Keep in mind, this isn't a problem with the engine,
just means that the fuel is dirtier.  

Tuning is also important.  Gas engines are more
tunable than diesel, as you can get better power
increases from gas than you can with diesel.  The
major thing diesel owners tend to go for is turbo,
as it is one sure way to match gasoline in terms
of power.

A turbo charged diesel can and will match a standard
gasoline engine for power, if not slightly better it
a bit.  This is why most diesel cars come turbo
charged, as its a way to keep up with the modern
diesel engines of today.  

When it comes to making the choice, you really have
to choose what is best for you and your needs.  If
you want power with plenty of tuning options, then
gasoline engines are what you want.  On the other
hand, if you want power and torque, then a diesel
vehicle is what you want.

The choices are entirely up to you, as there are
certainly plenty to choose from.  Always check out
the vehicle you are interested in, and find out
if it will match your needs.  Before you know it,
you'll have a diesel or gas vehicle that will perform
well beyond your expectations.
