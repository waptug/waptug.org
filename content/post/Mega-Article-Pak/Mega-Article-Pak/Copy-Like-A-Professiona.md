Copy Like A Professional

Anyone who has burned CDs in the past has had to
have encountered this problem - your CD doesn't
want to play in certain CD players.  You've probably
tried switching to a different brand of disks, 
switching the writing speed of your CD burning 
software, and yet nothing seems to work.

Most professional CDs that are purchased from a
retail outlet such as Circuit City or Best Buy
works in any type of CD player, which probably makes
you wonder what they are doing that your not.  All
of us wonder this, especially when out duplicated
CDs don't want to play back like they should.

Much to the contrary, it's because the music
industry burns their CDs differently.  Instead
of simply duplicating CDs, the music industry
chooses to replicate CDs.  Even though the 
terminology may seem synonymous, the process is
actually totally different.

CD replication is used for the mass production of
CDs, which is normally more than 500.  Instead
of writing the data to a CD using a laser as
with duplication, CD replication uses a glass
master to stamp (or press) the data onto the
disc.  This helps to eliminate almost all of the
issues associated with playability that are 
encountered when burning CDs at home.  CD 
replication is a far superior process of burning
CDs.

Important to note, is the superior quality of
CDs that are pressed using replication doesn't 
come cheap.  Even when using independant CD
duplication companies such as Absolute Disc or
Oasis, there is still going to be a very high
cost associated with the replication of disks.

For your next project, try having your CDs 
replicated rather than duplicated.  This will
ensure your project is very high quality, even
though you'll need to order more than 500 CDs
to recive this process.
