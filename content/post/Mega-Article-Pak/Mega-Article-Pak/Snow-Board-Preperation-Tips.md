Snow Board Preparation Tips

Everyone that loves snow boarding knows that accidents can easily happen, and accidents do happen on a daily basis. That is why you have to follow basic tips to prepare before you actually hit the slopes, and if you do not follow the basic rules then you are simply asking for accidents to happen. That is why I recommend that anyone who is planning a snow board tip should do the following before they even consider leaving the house:

1.	Ensure that you clean your board and your boots. When you allow your boots and board to get dirty, then they not click into place as well, and you also risk slipping etc. More than anything else you should never deliberately go to the slope with boots and a board that are dirty. 
2.	You should always ensure that a member of your family or friends knows where you are, and when you are expected to be back. If you are out on a long run, and something wrong happens, then you are left to rely on someone to find you if the worst happens and you get lost with an injury.
3.	 Always wear waterproof clothes. If you do not wear waterproof clothing then you are surely asking for problems. This means water proof trousers, water proof jacket, and water proof gloves are a must.
4.	Make sure that you do not eat something that is too filling or you may end up with cramps and the kind of thing that you have to try and avoid. The best food that you can eat before you hit the slopes is high calorie, low fat foods, such as pasta for example.
5.	Do not consider trying runs that are well in advance of your ability levels, the trick is to take things slowly and try and build up gradually, time by time, every time you visit. Jumping ahead of yourself can actually mean that you place too much pressure on yourself and you end up not wanting to come back. 
6.	Consider your friends and prepare how you are going to act based on those that you are going snow boarding with. If the snow boarder is an amateur, then you have to think how you would feel if you were to go snow boarding with someone and they were to always try more challenging runs. You would surely try and compete and that can cause accidents and embarrassment. 
7.	Bring a change of clothing and a snack for when you are out. It is good to come prepared and you do not want your day to end early because your clothes are uncomfortable or because you are hungry or thirsty. Remember that when you are out on the slopes that if you fail to drink enough then problems can happen. You may feel cold, so you do not feel thirsty, but that is why you have to try and ensure that have enough to drink.  

Making sure that you are prepared for going on a snow boarding trip is one of the best ways to ensure that you have a great day, and so does everyone around you. Taking that extra time, to ensure that everything is going to go smoothly will surely pay off when you are on the slopes.
