Vacations And Home Security

Nothing is more stressful, disappointing, or downright sickening than returning home from a hard earned vacation – only to find that your home had been robbed.  Burglary is a common thing these days, with burglary around the home occurring quite frequently.  When you go on a vacation, you shouldn’t have to worry about the condition of your home and your things.  Your vacation should be relaxing, without having to worry about anything.  If you plan ahead before you go on your vacation – you can help to minimize the risks of anything going wrong.

One way to fend off burglars is by hiring a house sitter.  A house sitter is one of the best ways to get rid of any type of trouble as well.  All you need to do is find someone who will swing by your house a few times a day, check on things, and turn the lights on at night.  If you have animals at your house, you may want to hire a house sitter to care for your animals as well as your home.  In most cases, peace of mind is worth any price.  If you decide to hire a house sitter, you should always make sure that you choose someone reliable who you can trust while you are away.

In the event that you are unable to get a house sitter, you should strive to make it appear as if someone is living in your home.  To be on the safe side, you can have a neighbor whom you trust keep an eye on your home.  Whoever you choose to watch your property should have a number to contact you with in case something goes wrong.

You can buy various timers and such that will make it appear as if people are in your home.  Radio timers and light timers can go a long way in making criminals believe someone is at your house.  You’ll also want to consider your lawn before you leave as well.  If the grass is too high, people will wonder if anyone is home.  You should always cut it before you leave, and have someone else cut it for you if you are going to be gone for more than a week.

You’ll also want someone to pick up your mail as well.  If the mail starts to pile up in your box, criminals will know that you aren’t home.  Even though you may not be on vacation for long, you should always make sure that your door is locked and that you leave the spare key with someone whom you trust who can keep an eye on things for you.

When that individual comes by your home to check on things, they should be sure to turn the lights and television on in the evening.  You should also make sure that your trusted person knows to check on the interior of your home, and look for anything out of the ordinary.  If something is wrong, that person shouldn’t hesitate to contact the police.  A broken widow, door, or furniture out of place is the first sign that something is wrong.  

Vacations are something we all need to take.  Vacations are supposed to be fun and relaxing, with no worries about anything else.  If you take the necessary steps before you leave, you shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Whether it’s a friend or family member stopping by to check on things or a house sitter that you’ve hired – peace of mind goes a long way in helping you make the most of your very important vacation.
