Discovering Microbrews

Brewed on every continent around the world and
enjoyed in every nation, beer can quench every type
of thirst and go down as easily as spring water
to thick, heady concoctions that resemble that of
the thickest oatmeal.

Just as the gourmet blends have conquered a large
portion of the coffee business, handcrafted brews
continue to keep a firm hold on the most serious
of beer drinkers.  There are hundreds of thousands
of brews out there, which are sure to please even
the hardest to please.

When it comes to the gourmet types of microbrews,
there are some things to keep in mind.  If you
are new to microbrews and gourmet types, you'll
find the tips below to be very beneficial.

Start light
When you go to a pub or just out to drink, you
should start off light with a basic lager, pilsner,
or wheat beer.  After that, you can work your way
towards the full flavored beers, such as porters
and Oktoberfest beers.  These can be very potent,
especially for those who don't really drink that
much.

Starting light is also good for your overall 
tolerance, as drinking light will prepare you for
the more potent drinks.  This way, you can enjoy
plenty of microbrews without having to worry 
about stopping too early.

Brewpub
The ideal way to try new types of beer is to pay
a visit to a local brewpub.  Many of these small
brewery/restaurants will offer samplers, which
feature small glasses with four to five of their
most popular beers.  

This way, you can experience a variety of beer
tastes without having to spend a lot of money.
Once you have tried a couple of the beers, you'll
know what to order.  

Dark beers
If you are a casual beer drinker or can handle 
your tolerance, you shouldn't be afraid in the
least to try dark beers.  The dark color doesn't
mean that the beer is heavier or contains more
calories, it simply means that the malt in the
beer is roasted longer or roasted to a more darker
color than most.

Small business
Small businesses and small businessmen are yet
another reason to get into microbrewed beer other
than the taste.  Local microbrew producers brew
their beers in small batches, so you'll be helping
to keep the business afloat, rather than supporting
the large giants of the industry.

When you know that your money is going to help the
little people, you'll normally find the brew to go
down much smoother.  Small microbreweries need 
all the help they can get to continue brewing, 
which is reason enough to support them.  You'll get
a great beer for your money - and you'll be 
supporting those that actually need your help.
