American Express Credit Cards

Also known as AMEX, American Express is easily one of the most recognized names in the world of credit cards.  Even though many people have Visa or MasterCard credit cards, they are still interested in AMEX.  With Visa, MasterCard, and AMEX being the most popular and preferred types of credit cards, they are all great although there are also differences between them as well.

Both Visa and MasterCard are methods of payment.  Both will allow different businesses to accept credit card payments using their systems.  Neither of the two issue credit cards on their own behalf, instead they rely on banks throughout the world to issue the credit cards for them, provide the credit, and then charge the interest.  Your credit card bill goes to the bank, as Visa or MasterCard doesn’t see any of it.

AMEX on the other hand, is very different.  American Express has their own payment system, and they also issue their credit cards directly to consumers.  Unlike Visa and MasterCard, AMEX runs the entire show.  Therefore, when a credit card says American Express on it, you instantly know who has issued the card, what payment system it has, and everything else you would need to know.

Even though MasterCard and Visa are used more throughout the world, American Express is always expanding their networks.  Visa and MasterCard are used in over twenty five million locations over the world, including third world countries, which makes them global credit card payments.  AMEX on the other hand, doesn’t quite reach this degree.  It is a great credit card, although it isn’t used around the world in areas where the other 2 dominant credit cards are.

You can get AMEX credit cards with rewards, although you’ll need to be careful where you look and what you select.  Normally, with Visa and MasterCard, you’ll have to look at hundreds of banks before you can find the best choice.  With AMEX, you can look at their website and find out what they offer and what type of APR you’ll have to pay.  Most of the time, you can find a credit card with low interest and a great spending limit - providing you have good credit.

AMEX also has several advantages that it offers customers in North America and Europe.  The credit card is accepted widely in both areas, offering you credit cards with great features and very attractive looks.  AMEX offers you great rates, good rewards, and excellent customer service as well.  

American Express also offers you Blue, which is a newly introduced credit card that offers you increased security, no annual fee, and 0% APR for the first year or so.  Depending on your credit, you may be able to get an extended period with no interest.  After that time has expired, you pay low fees, which makes it a great credit card for anyone looking for a deal.  Blue is the newest card from AMEX, and will rapidly become one of the best - due to it’s amazing features.

In the world of credit cards, American Express is one of the best.  They offer you a variety of different credit cards, designed to meet just about everyone’s needs.  You find them online or through a local provider, although online is the preferred way to go.  Simply fill out your application, and if you have good credit, you’ll be approved.  Before you know it, you’ll have a credit card from AMEX - and be ready to experience life in the fast lane.
