The image features of the new iPod video
      
      
Although the dimensions of the new iPod video are smaller, the display thinner, the screen dimensions are bigger and the image quality is better. These advantages are not the only ones as the new iPod video keeps more surprises regarding the image and the screen display. 
      The large color screen and reduced dimensions of the video and audio device is the attractive point of the new iPod video. This aspect makes possible the explicit reading of the menu, of the options and possibilities as it has a bright, sharp text.
      
The screen quality of the new iPod video may be compared to the screen quality of any TV set and it may even become the winner of such a contest. Both the design of the new iPod and the video features are very well thought out and the most important aspect is that the resolution is up to 320x240. The resolution quality is comparable to the quality of VHS video tape, being less than half that of a DVD. That is why the sunny weather, the too bright rooms are not a problem for watching the videos on the iPod video. These obstacles are great enemies of the previous handheld video devices of reduced dimensions and these do not matter anymore, especially when it is the case of the new iPod video.
      
The possibility of watching the favorite music video and Disney or Pixar video, the TV shows of films on the road, away from home was a matter of dreams not long time ago. And this dream is possible now due to the next step in video technology. 
      
Besides, the new iPod video has also some amazing options with the photo album because of great quality of the images. You may also rate your photos or create slideshows with your favorite ones so that your past empty moments may be filled with great memories. This fact is also due to the eliminated common obstacles (sunshine, bright indoors or outdoors) of watching videos on other different mini video devices. Another important aspect concerning the options of the iPod video is that it provides full-size thumbnails for photos.
      
Besides, the new iPod video can import digital photos directly from any type of camera or card reader. During this transfer, the thumbnails of the imported images are showed on the screen of the iPod. After the mentioned transfer, you may browse the imported pictures. Unfortunately, you cannot display the transferred pictures on the TV set.
      
The video image of the new iPod video is surprisingly clear, bright and sharp taking into account the size of the screen. Excellent music and video on the same handheld device is more than joyful news, having great advantages and well thought features. 
      
Although the battery longevity for watching the videos are only of 2 hours, the new video device has a great success and may be of great need for those who are very busy. This solution is ideal for spending the time on the train, bus or airplane, maybe waiting for them or simply having a break at the office. In the end, the new iPod video is a great music player with some features for playing video a little bit so that the time would pass more quickly.  
      
The combination of excellent image and sound is a very good achievement and a tempting offer for lovers of pocket devices to be in touch with music and other aspects of the contemporary life. These aspects of the new iPod video are especially preferred by the teenagers with their crazy lifestyle. Nevertheless, some adults may also like the high quality of the image, the options for the photo album and the slideshow. These aspects make the images, favorite videos and photos being easy to share with other people.
      
The best combination of high quality image and high quality sound is to be found in the new iPod video. Still, the novelty is represented by the video features on a handheld device that represent a step in the video technology.
