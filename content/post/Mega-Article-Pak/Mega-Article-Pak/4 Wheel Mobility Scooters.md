Sometimes there is a basket attached to the scooter and other times there are not.

The 4 wheel mobility scooters enable a person to ride along on the scooter much in the manner or a small and personalized car.

The four wheels provide a comfortable situation for the individual to be in, and they easily allow the person to go backwards, forwards, left and right.  This is very beneficial for individuals that are hurt, and still need to go grocery shopping.  For example, if a person breaks one or both of their legs, this will have no effect on their eating schedule.  Even while their legs heal, they will likely still need to eat, play and work.  Having an injury should not prevent a person from performing any of these processes.
