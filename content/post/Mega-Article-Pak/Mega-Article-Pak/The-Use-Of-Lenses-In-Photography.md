The Use Of Lenses In Photography

Just having a camera is not going to get you the best pictures.  Most of us who take photos are amateurs in the art world, but with the right equipment our photography can be elevated to a new height.  Lenses are important especially when you settle on a medium you will train in.  Most photographers choose one area of photography to specialize in.  There are many types of lenses, the standard 35- 80mm, telephoto, and panoramic lenses.  

Most cameras have a 35- 80 mm lens, even the point and shoot type.  Often when you purchase a camera casing they will sell you the standard lens with it.  All lenses are interchangeable.  You do have to stick with the same brand of lenses as your camera and make sure the diameter is the same.  The diameter of most lenses is the same as long as you keep to the same brand.  The 35- 80 mm lens tells you the extent of reach.  While you can take photographs several miles away with a standard lens you will not have the distinction of features in the print that you need.  The standard lens is great for close up shots, such as flowers, spider webs, people, and pets.  To gain more defined picture miles away you need a larger lens.

There are many telephoto lenses in photography.  One is the 75- 300 mm lens.  While this is not as massive as other telephoto lenses you may see a professional walking around with it is a great step up for mountain and wildlife photography when your quarry is some distance away.  When you begin to move from the 35mm into something larger it is best to have a stabilizer with the lens.  A stabilizer will help you hold the camera steady for clear shots even if your hand moves a little bit.  When you move into the world of the telephoto lens you can by accessories to help with angles and light. 

Photography in the world of panorama is another way to take spectacular landscape photos.  The panoramic lens allows you to widen the photograph, especially with a digital camera.  If there is a mountain range or glacier that you wish to get the whole picture without pasting them together in Photoshop the panoramic lens is the best way to go.  I’m sure you have seen landscapes with a panoramic view and wished you could have that option.  Even with film cameras you could have a panoramic lens to widen the photograph.  

All three lenses are just the icebergs on the use of lenses in photography.  Whether you are an amateur photographer or a budding professional you will want to maximize your photo taking skills.  The next equipment you may want to purchase to help you with the larger lenses would be a tripod to stabilize the camera even more.  Tripods are pretty simple and lightweight pieces of equipment and work great for portrait photography.  All mediums in photography require moderate to top of the line camera equipment to produce a photograph with quality.  Photography also relies on the photographer’s skill and eye.  Lenses are just a small part of the photography world when you start to study the art.  If you have any questions on lenses the best places to find answers are your local photography shop.
