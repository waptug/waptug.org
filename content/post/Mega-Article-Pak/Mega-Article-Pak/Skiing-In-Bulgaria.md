Skiing In Bulgaria

Ok, so I know Bulgaria isn’t likely to be the first place that springs to mind when you think about a skiing vacation.  However, you’d be surprised to learn that Bulgaria is becoming an increasingly popular destination of choice for holiday makers across Europe, and the world.  A new breed of European country, Bulgaria is beginning to build towards becoming an industrialised, metropolitan nation.  The eastern European nation has a surprising depth of history and culture, and is truly an excellent place to discover.  With this national growth comes the development of its inherent passion for skiing, and this is evident across the country, with various ski resorts springing up all over the place.

Bulgaria’s most recognised ski resort is Bansko.  As a result of massive investment in Bulgaria, particularly in the development of the tourism industries, Bansko is undergoing extensive refurbishment and modernisation, to create a facility that can compete on a world scale.  As well as time and money spent on developing hotels, luxurious apartments, ski lifts and other facilities, there is also a great deal being ploughed into refining the actual slopes themselves, to ensure a high quality, internationally acceptable skiing conditions.  With impressive snow coverage from late November through to spring, Bansko is an ideal location for a ski resort, and this is reflected by its increasing popularity.  The beautiful village itself is rich in history and tradition, and you’ll find the people very warm and welcoming; eager to please, and ensure you have a good time.

Another of Bulgaria’s major ski resorts is Pamporovo, situated on the Rhodopi Mountain.  A thoroughly modernised resort, Pamporovo boasts an extensive training academy and well maintained ski runs for all abilities.  The most southern resort in Europe, Pamporovo benefits from a particularly sunny climate, with around four months of sunshine, and plenty of snow.  That means you’ll never be skiing in too unpleasant conditions!  Pamporovo is also more than adequately equipped to deal with holiday makers in terms of auxiliary services, and has recently unveiled plans for a state of the art ski lift.  With so much time and investment being spent on these slopes, it really is an ideal time to visit Bulgaria.

Of course the beauty of Bulgaria as a great skiing location is that it is relatively untouched and undiscovered.  This means that you can benefit from the excellent facilities without having to contend with too many tourists.  Thus, Bulgaria provides an excellent opportunity to enjoy skiing in eace and quiet, in idyllic settings.  Additionally, for a trip in Bulgaria, you’re going to be paying significantly less than other European countries for the same amazing weather and fantastic skiing.  Bulgaria really is a win/win location for any skiing holiday.

With such extensive investment in the nation, Bulgaria is an up and coming holiday destination as it pushes towards European integration.  By nursing an ever strengthening tourism industry, the nation is growing continually, and this is great news for skiing enthusiasts who can benefit from its excellent natural resources and ski resort facilities.  Additionally, with such a quality-orientated approach, Bulgaria is challenging the more industrialised European nations in terms of service and produce. For a low cost, high quality skiing vacation, Bulgaria has to be a consideration, so why not book your vacation, and discover Europe’s best kept skiing secret for yourself?
