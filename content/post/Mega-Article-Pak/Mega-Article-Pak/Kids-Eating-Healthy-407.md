Kids Eating Healthy

Fast food is a big part of modern life these days,
making it very hard to teach a child how he or she
should eat healthy.  The cheapest and easiest foods
are those that are normally the least healthy.  If 
you give your child the choice between healthy food
and junk food, you normally won't like the results.

Even though it isn't possible to get a child to like
all healthy foods, there are some ways to get your
child to try and hopefully like at least a few of
them.  You can be as creative as you like, as getting 
kids to eat healthy foods can be a little harder than
you may think.

-  Sneak the healthy food in.  Even though it would 
be great if your kid understood the importance of 
fruits and vegetables, this isn't always possible.
If you can't get them to eat good food willingly, 
there are ways to sneak them in, such as making 
muffins out of bananas or apples, or pizza with
spinach on it.

-  Call fruits and vegetables by funny names.  You
can refer to broccoli as "trees", making them 
more fun to eat.  There are many different names
you can call fruits and vegetables, even making up
your own if you prefer.  Most kids prefer to eat
foods that sound fun.

-  Make the foods taste better. Ranch dressing is
great for broccoli, while peanut butter is a great
topping for celery.  There are several combinations
for vegetables that can make them taste much
better.  You can let your child pick a topping
for a vegetable, even if it's something you wouldn't
normally like yourself.

-  Dress the vegetables up.  Just as much as calling
them names help kids eat healthy foods, making them
look funny also helps.  You can do this by making 
funny designs on the plate, or setting them up to
look like people.  Although some parents don't like
their kids playing with their food, sometimes it
helps to get them to eat healthier.

There are several ways to make your kids eat 
healthier, but to make them enjoy it also has to
be fun as well.  This isn't always an easy task, 
because kids normally don't like foods that are
good for them.  It can however, be done with a bit
of creativity.  Hopefully, doing this will help
your child develop a love of healthy foods for the
rest of their lives.
