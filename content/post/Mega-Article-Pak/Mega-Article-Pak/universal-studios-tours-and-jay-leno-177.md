Universal Studios Tours and Jay Leno

If you will be visiting Universal Studios Tours, and 
you wish to see the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, 
you may be in luck – if you get to the Hollywood 
Ticket Outlet booth early enough. Getting to see 
Jay Leno in person and be a part of the Tonight 
Show audience may be the perfect end to the 
perfect day!

Again, make sure that you get to the booth early. 
Exclusive seating is limited to a first come, first serve 
basis. Only two priority tickets will be made available 
for each person, and nobody under the age of sixteen 
may attend the show. These tickets go fairly fast, and 
once they are gone, they are gone for good.

The Hollywood Ticket Outlet Booth is located inside 
the Universal Studios Tours park, near the Blues 
Brothers stage. If you get there early enough, you 
could be sitting in the studio audience enjoying Jay 
Leno’s monolog very shortly! Your friends won’t 
believe you, so make sure that you get souvenirs 
before leaving Universal Studios, and save your 
ticket stub!
