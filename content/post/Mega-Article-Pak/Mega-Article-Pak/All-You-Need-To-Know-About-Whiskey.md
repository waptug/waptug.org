All You Need To Know About Whiskey

In meaning, whiskey translates to “water of life”.  Whiskey originated from Scotland during the early 1400's, and is very popular around the world today. Even today, whiskey tastes much like it did when it first began.  Manufacturers of whiskey are strong on heritage, and therefore do all they can to capture the flavor that whiskey has always been known for.

For any occasion, whiskey is truly great.  Whiskey is commonly used during weddings and ceremonies, and both the bride and groom will drink it to signify a relationship that will stand the test of time. The drink isn’t only served with weddings, as it is also popular in bars and restaurants as well.  Those wishing to signify friendship can also serve whisky as a gesture of wanting to be friends.

Although it has many uses, one of the best is ice cubes.  If you combine whiskey with ice cubes, the combination is truly inspiring.  People often refer to it as whiskey on the rocks, as it is very commonly served in bars and restaurants.

There are several variations of whiskey as well.  Scottish whiskey, Jack Daniels, and Wild Turkey are among the most popular.  Scottish whiskey is very popular in different parts of the world, while Jack Daniels is the preferred brand of whiskey in the United States.  Jack is served at many bars and restaurants, and provides a great mixed drink if you pair it with Coke.
