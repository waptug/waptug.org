All Natural Freebies abound in Seattle

If you're an outdoors kind of person and really enjoy the sights and sounds of nature, or simply enjoy not being trapped inside a building all day, then Seattle Washington has plenty to offer you should you decide to visit. When planning your visit to Seattle, you will probably find that there are many things that appeal to you and it is quite difficult to narrow them down by interest alone. 

This is the point when I divide activities into categories such as: things I really want to do, things that seem interesting, and things that will really just pass the time. Then, I take those things and do a reality (which translates to price) check. I try to justify the expenses of the things I really want to do that are more than I'd like to pay by sneaking in things I'd like to do equally as much for free. It's a great concept and works really well when giving children a choice of activities. Let them choose between two free activities. They still get a voice and feel as though they are an important part of the decision making process and you aren't spending $50 an hour for them to jump on a fancy trampoline.

Here are some of the excellent free activities that can be enjoyed in the great outdoors of Seattle Washington. The really great news is that many of these are actually both entertaining and educational. This is good for you and the kids who will leave Seattle with some degree of knowledge about something other than the ice cream flavors that are offered there.

The first freebie that I recommend is the Volunteer Park Conservatory. This is of special interest to those who love flowers. The conservatory is divided into five houses which each provides a suitable habitat for growing very specific plants. The five houses are: Bromeliad House, which is members of the pineapple family; Palm House, which consists of about 1200 species; Fern House, which features an assortment of tropical ferns and other exotic plants; Seasonal Display House, which changes with the season and consists of many common and recognizable house plants; and Cactus House, which is rather self explanatory. The conservatory is free to the public and a great way to pass time for any flower lover in your group.

Next there is the Washington Arboretum Park. This park is actually a 200-acre arboretum that was designed by the same firm responsible for the design of Central Park in New York. The park hosts 40,000 trees, shrubs, and vines. You can pay for a tour or simply wander around and enjoy the landscape. The purpose of this park is to preserve certain species of plants while offering education to the public and anyone who wishes to learn and benefit from the knowledge that can be gained there. 

Next there is the Woodland Park Rose Garden. This garden is located next to the zoo but is open to the public free of charge. There is a $4 parking fee during zoo hours, but parking is free after hours. The climate of Seattle is mild enough that roses seem to flourish and grow beautifully here. The rose gardens receive over 200,000 visitors each year and are a great sight to see while you are visiting Seattle. 

Finally, there is Discovery Park. This park offers stunning views and a place to contemplate the beauty of nature and the surroundings of Seattle. The park itself is 534-acres making it the largest city park in Seattle. The purpose of this park was to provide sanctuary for wildlife and a place to learn about nature for those who were interested. The park has a play area for children, picnic equipment, and trails and paths for exploration.

Nature is a wonderful thing to behold and Seattle is blessed with some of the most beautiful natural surroundings on earth. It only makes sense that while on vacation you should be able to enjoy the beautiful plants, animals, and scenery that abound in the area. I sincerely hope you take the opportunity to enjoy some of these great places.
