Avoiding Foods While Breast Feeding

Many women find that they can eat whatever they may
like during breast feeding.  Even though it's true
that some stongly favored foods can change the 
taste of your milk, many babies seem to enjoy the
varieties of breast milk flavors.  Occasionally,
your baby may get cranky at the breast after you
eat certain foods.  If you notice this happening,
simply avoid that particular food.

The most common offenders duing breast feeding 
include chocolate, spices, citrus fruits, garlic,
chili, lime, gassy vegetables, and fruits with
laxative type effects, such as prunes and cherries.

You can have a cup or two of coffee a day, although
too much caffeine can interfere with your baby's 
sleep and even make him or her cranky.  Keep in
mind, caffeine is found in many soda's, tea, and 
even over the counter type medicine as well.

It's okay to have an alcoholic beverage every now
and the, although having more than one drink can
increase your blood alcohol level, putting the
alcohol into your breast milk.  

If you are planning to have more than one drink
at a time, it's best to wait two hours or more
per drink before you resume any type of nursing
or breast feeding.  There is no need to pump
and dump unless your breasts are full and its
time to feed your baby.  While breast feeding,
any type of heavy drinking should be avoided.

Before you actually omit any foods from your
diet, you should talk to your doctor.  If you
avoid certain foods and it causes a nutritional
imbalance, you may need to see a nutritionist 
for advice on taking other foods or getting 
nutritional supplements.
