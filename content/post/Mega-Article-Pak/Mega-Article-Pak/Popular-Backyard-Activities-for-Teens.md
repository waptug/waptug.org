Popular Backyard Activities for Teens

Just about everyone one enjoys being outside. There is just something about being outdoors that creates excitement.  While all individuals may enjoy relaxing or playing in their backyard, there are some who get the chance to be outside more than others.  Those individuals include teenagers. Most teenagers love being outside; in fact, during the summertime most can be found in their backyard.  

One thing, when it comes to teenagers, is that many are hard to please. This is because many teenagers are at the age where they easily lose interest in certain activities.  If you are the parent of a teenager, especially one that will be spending their summer break at home, you may want to familiarize yourself with some popular backyard activities, especially those designed with teenagers in mind.  Not only may this familiarization give you ideas for family friendly backyard activities, but it may also help to ensure that your teenager is outside, instead of spending their summer indoors.

If you have a pool in your backyard, your teen may literally be set for the whole summer. Although many teens get bored with certain activities, there is just something unique about a swimming pool. In fact, if given the opportunity, many teenagers would spend their entire summer break in their swimming pool.  While most teenagers are experienced swimmers, not all are.  If your teenager will be spending their summer break alone, you may want to establish some pool rules. These rules may help to ensure that they are safe while swimming alone. 

Even though swimming is one of the most popular backyard activities, for teens, not everyone has a pool.  If you are looking for a way for you child to cool off during the summertime, but without having to purchase an expensive pool, you may want to examine the kiddie pools that are available. Kiddie pools are a great and safe way for teens to say cool in the summer.  When it comes to kiddie pools, not all teens will want to use them. However, many teenage girls enjoy wading in a kiddie pool, especially with their friends. 

If a swimming pool, including a kiddie pool, is not an option, you may want to focus on other fun, outdoor water activities.  Many teens enjoy playing with water balloons or water guns. These water activities are a great way to cool off, but they are also fun to play with others.  Whether your teen is playing with their siblings or their friends, it is safe to assume that everyone will have a fun and cool time.  

Other fun, but dry, outdoor games may include horseshoes, basketball, football, soccer, kickball, baseball, or volleyball. As with most games, the games that your child will be able to participate will depend on if they are playing by themselves or with someone else. For those playing alone, basketball is an idea. Teens playing their siblings or friends will not have a shortage of games to choose from.  In fact, most backyard games are designed with two or more players in mind.

While it is important to focus on backyard activities, such as games, you may also want to think about what your child will eat. If they will be spending the majority of their time outside, you may want to think about allowing them to eat in the backyard.  Barbeques are ideal, when adults are present.  If your teen will be alone or with their friends, you may want to suggest a backyard picnic.  A few drinks, sandwiches, or snacks can make for an easy and safe backyard meal.

When organizing backyard activities, for your teen, you may also want to get them involved.  Teenagers are at the age where they like to make their own decisions. While your suggestions may be great appreciated, your teenager may have their own backyard activities in mind.  If this is the case, that is fine; however, you may want to make sure that those backyard activities are not only fun, but safe.
