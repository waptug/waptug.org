Everything You Need to Know About Laser Wart Removal

Laser hair removal, have you heard of it before?  Laser hair removal is rapidly increasing in popularity. Amazingly, laser treatment can prevent or greatly reduce the growth of body hair. If you think that is amazing, wait until you hear what else laser treatment can do.  If you suffer from warts, you may be able to have your warts eliminated with laser treatments.  

Laser wart removal is done at a professional office. There are a number of dermatologists who can offer this type of treatment, but it is most commonly found in laser treatment centers. Laser treatment centers are centers that tend to focus solely on conditions that can be treated by lasers.  These conditions may include, but are not limited, unwanted body hair, poor vision, as well as warts.  

As previously mentioned, your best chance for undergoing laser wart removal is to contact a local laser treatment center. If you have a primary care physician, they may be able to point you in the direction of a well-known and trusted laser treatment center.  If you do not have a primary care physician, who can provide you with recommendations, you are advised to use the internet or your local phone book.  Both of these resources should be able to provide you with the contact information of local laser treatment centers.

When it comes to undergoing a laser wart removal, there is a good chance that you may need to make a consultation appointment.  This appointment, if it is needed, will be used to fully examine your body, as well as the warts that you would like removed. If you are being referred by a dermatologist or even your family physician, it is possibly that you may not need to have a consultation appointment; however, to make that possible you should request that your doctor share all of your medical files with the laser treatment center that you plan on using. This may make it possible for your consultation appointment to be eliminated.

Consultation appointments are not only used to examine your warts, but they are also used to prepare you for the procedure.  If you are not planning on having a consultation appointment, it is important that you understand exactly how the procedure will go. You should easily be able to do this online or by speaking to your laser treatment center’s staff.  You will likely find that the laser, which is typically a pulsed dye laser, will cutoff of the wart’s blood supply. This will cause the wart to dry up and later fall off.  

When it comes to laser wart removal, one of the most common questions asked is about pain.  Despite what you may believe or may have heard, laser wart removal is relatively painless and sometimes even pain-free.
