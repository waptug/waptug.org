Decorating your Home Theater on a Budget

If you are fortunate enough to be building a room in your home that is dedicated to the purpose of watching movies or as a home theater it only makes sense that you would like to decorate the room in a manner that is completely befitting of its purpose. There are amazing options available within this growing market of decorating and generally, there are prices that are designed to match. The good news is that while art often imitates life, there is no reason that we can't imitate some of the great art we see in the movies or on televisions shows in our homes-at a fraction of the cost.

First of all, a really good home theater is an investment, particularly those that are generally used in private rooms. With that being said you will want to decorate your room in a manner that will not distract from your movie watching experience. There are many ways you can do this and many of them come at rather hefty costs for the average consumer. You do not have to purchase special lighting at $500 a pop when you can go to your local lighting or home improvement store and find excellent wall sconces that will be perfect for your home theater at a fraction of the cost for which you will find them at specialty stores catering to those building home theaters. For more low lighting options you can use inexpensive strings of rope lighting or even Christmas tree lights in order to provide some light without risking a glare on the screen.

Rather than hanging expensive drapery on the walls in your home theater you can apply textured paint in dark colors in order to avoid distracting glares. Your local retailer may encourage you to soundproof your walls and you are the only one that can really decide if that is necessary. I personally would pass, particularly if your home theater is going to be in a basement, which is typically somewhat removed from the rest of your home and your family area. 

As far as flooring goes, darker carpeting is a good idea in most areas though possibly not the best in a basement. Cork makes a good flooring option for basement floors as is works to muffle sound from escaping the room in addition to a natural resistance to moisture related problems that may occasionally arise in a basement. It is also a very inexpensive flooring material that is highly underrated. 

I also recommend dark furnishing for your home theater. A good choice might be darkly colored sectional sofas if you want the family to enjoy the space together. I also recommend beanbags or other special seating for the little ones who may enjoy your home theater as well. This gives them their own seats and helps eliminate some of the bickering and squabbles that often arise over premium seating space.

The point is that you do not have to spend a fortune in order to create a great atmosphere that is totally conducive to an overall pleasant movie watching experience in your home theater. While I do not recommend a great deal of clutter along the walls in this particular room you can do great things with plastic popcorn boxes and flameless tea light candles along the floor. Let your imagination present creative options to the big-ticket items you see in the specialty shops you'll be amazed at some of the neat things you come up with.
