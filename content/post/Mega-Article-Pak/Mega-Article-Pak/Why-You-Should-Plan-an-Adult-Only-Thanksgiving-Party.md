Why You Should Plan an Adult Only Thanksgiving Party

Have you recently decided that you would like to host a Thanksgiving party?  If so, have you decided which type of party you would like to host?  Unfortunately, a large number of Thanksgiving party hosts don’t really realize that they have a choice.  The reality is that you do.  If you want, you could have a casual Thanksgiving party, a formal Thanksgiving party, a Thanksgiving party with adults and kids, or a Thanksgiving party with just adults; the decision is yours to make.  However, you may find that an adult only party is the way to go.

Perhaps, the first question that you should ask yourself is can you host an adult only party?  An adult only party is a party where only adults are present, no kids. While you may prefer to have an adult only party, it may be a little bit difficult for you to do, especially if you have kids.  If you can find someone to watch your children for the day or the evening, you may be able to have an adult only Thanksgiving party, but it is also important to remember your guest, they too might have kids.

Although you may find it difficult to host an adult party, you may want to give it some serious thought.  This is because there are an unlimited number of benefits to hosting an adult party. One of those benefits is that adult drinks can be served.  Of course, you can always serve alcoholic beverages at a Thanksgiving party when kids are present, but there are some who do not like to drink in front of children, especially their own children. There is a good chance that your party will be nice and fun without alcohol, but many adults enjoy drinking when at a social event.

An adult only Thanksgiving party may make it easier to choose entertainment for the party.  While you and other adults may enjoy dancing, young children may not always.  You can also play games centered on alcohol or even enjoy adult aged games, such as adult themed board games.  These types of games may not be ideal for children, particular because of the alcohol or the adult questions or answers that are needed to play certain party board games.  

Perhaps, the biggest benefit to having an adult only Thanksgiving party is the fact that there will be no kids present. While all parents love their kids, often more than their own life, there are times when a parent just needs a break. Whether you are a parent or some of your guests are, it is likely that they will enjoy the times to themselves.  It may seem silly, but an adult setting and adult conversations are things that many parents often long for. 

As previously mentioned, it may be a little bit difficult to plan a Thanksgiving party for adults only.  If you are not sure about what you should do, it may be a good idea to discuss it with some of your other party guests, especially those that have children.  There is a good chance that most of your party guests would still come to your party if their children couldn’t, but you may also find that some will not.  It may be a good idea to determine, ahead of time, what the majority of your guests would or wouldn’t do. This may help you to decide whether or not an adult only Thanksgiving party is worth it or even possible.
