Guide To Microbrews

Below, you will find a guide to some of the best brews
out there.  

Long Trail Brewery - Bridgewater, Vermont
This brewery offers several brews that will easily
quench your thirst.  The long trail ale is a very
good choice, as it's very tasty and not too heavy,
just right.  The hibernator is also good, although
it's winter seasonal and high in alcohol.  With a
pinch of honey, the pollenator provides a thirst
quenching solution to a hot summer haze.

Catamount Brewery - White River Junction - Vermont
The best seller here is the Catamount amber, as it
is very tasty.  The Catamount gold is also good, 
as it is lighter than the amber and offers plenty
of refreshment on a hot day.  For winter months,
the Catamount Christmas ale offers a crisp taste
for the cold.

7 Barrel Brewery - New Hampshire
The 7 Barrel Brewery is a restaurant as well as a
brewery.  The best brews here are the Dublin brown
ale and the red 7 ale, although you really can't
go wrong with any of their offerings.  They also
offer live music every Friday night with many 
great bands.

Vermont Pub - Burlington, Vermont
This pub is the sister brewery of the 7 Barrel 
Brewery.  They offer a great bar that serves two
rooms, with plenty of fresh and tasty beer.  The
brown ale and dog bite bitter are the best, as they
are both very tasty.

Magic Hat Brewery - Burlington, Vermont
This brewery offers some of the best in the state
of Vermont - as well as the entire United States!
Their well known popular number 9 can be found on
taps around the state.  When you visit, don't 
forget to look under the cap, as they call it
"Magic Hat" for a reason!
