Carpet Repair

How often you need to repair your carpet depends on
you.  There are instances such as burns, crushing, 
fading, furniture, bleeding, sprouting, and carpet
beetles where you'll want to take action.  Most of
the time, you can finish a repair job without needing
a professional, although there will be times when
you will need professional assistance.

Burns
Burns occur when a cigarette butt or flame comes 
in contact with the carpet.  If the burn is small,
the burnt fibers of the carpet can be cut out with
scissors.  If the burn is large, you'll need to 
replace the area with a new piece of carpet.  You 
can do this yourself if you know how, or have an
installer do it.

Fuzzing
This occurs when loose fibers come out on the edges
of the carpet.  To fix this, simply cut the fibers
that are sticking out. 

Furniture marks
Heavy furniture can result in indentations being
left on the carpet.  To get rid of these nasty
marks, you should sprinkle your carpet with some
club soda, place a towel over the area, then iron
it.  Do this a couple of times and you will see
your carpet begin to re-fluff.

Shading, crushing, and matting
A lot of traffic on the surface of the carpet will
cause it to flatten, which may give some types of
carpet a shaded appearance.  If this happens, you
should brush and vacuum the area.  If you can't
fix the problem, you may need to hire a professional,
as this can sometimes be very tricky.

Shedding and snagging
Shedding is a problem of usage, as the fibers will
surface on the carpet.  This isn't a defect in
manufacturing, but a normal problem.  To fix it,
you'll need to vacuum the area.  The snags on
the other hand are tufts that have pulled out of
the surface of the carpet.  They will occur more
often with loop pile than cut pile carpets.  You
should never pull them off, but instead cut them
off neatly with a pair of scissors.

Sprouting
A carpet is known to have sprouts only when there 
are tufts on it, which are longer than the rest.
As pulling on them will only damage the carpet
more, you should trim them off with scissors and
level them down to the rest of the pile.

Static electricity
This depends on the carpet material, construction,
and padding.  Humidity will play an important role
as the moisture in the air is absorbed by the
carpet fibers.  A humidifier will help to retain
moisture, and you can also spray the surface of
the carpet with an anti static agent.  

Carpet beetles
The best way to deal with carpet beetles is with
a strong vacuum suction.  You should always avoid
spillage and keep the surface of the carpet clean
of food.  The carpet beetles are quite annoying,
as they feed on wool, hair, hides, fur, grain,
seeds, and flour.  If the carpet is infested bad,
you professional cleaner is the way to go.

Bleeding or crocking
Bleeding of the carpet is the loss or transfer
of the color from one section to another.  Good
underlayments can help to prevent bleeding to
a certain degree.  Crocking on the other hand is
the loss of the carpets color when it is rubbed.
To avoid this, simply avoid getting your carpet
wet.

A carpet installation job that is one right can
help you reduce your repair worries to quite
an amazing degree.  You can always call a pro as
well, as their services will often end up being
much cheaper than if you were to go ahead and
replace the entire carpet.
