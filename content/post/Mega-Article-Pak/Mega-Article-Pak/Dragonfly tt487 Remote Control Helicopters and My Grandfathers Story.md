Dragonfly tt487 Remote Control Helicopters and My Grandfather's Story

My grandfather told me a very interesting story that inspired me to get a dragonfly tt487 remote control helicopter, and I’d like to share that story with you.

So, when my grandfather was a little boy, he lived in the rural parts of Pennsylvania.  His nearest neighbor was six miles away, so you can imagine that there weren’t many kids his age to hang around with.  He told me that to kill time during the afternoons, he would go down to a little swamp in the back of his house and catch dragonflies all day.  One summer, his cousin was visiting from New Jersey.

My grandfather thought that he would show him what he does each day and took him down to that old pond.  Well, my grandfather’s cousin, being from a suburb of New York City, was not was not accustomed to playing with bugs.  His favorite hobbies were matchbox cars, so when my grandfather’s cousin saw the big dragonfly that my grandfather was trying to catch, he screamed and ran inside the house and didn’t come out for the rest of the summer.  Years later, my grandfather enlisted in the armed forces and was actually one of the first trained US soldiers to fly a helicopter during combat.

Between my grandfather’s hilarious dragon fly story (that he must have told me fifteen or twenty times) to honoring his career and bravery defending out country in the air force, when I discovered that there were dragonfly tt487 remote control helicopters out in the market, I simply could not pass up the chance to purchase one.  Besides being a great tribute to my grandfather (who about four years ago, passed away from prostate cancer at the age of seventy nine), the dragonfly tt487 remote control helicopters are a great flying device.  My son never really got to know my grandfather, who would be his great-grandfather, so I always take the opportunity to tell my son about the great man my grandfather was when we’re flying our dragonfly tt487 remote control helicopters in the large dewy meadow behind our house.

My son even makes fun of me because just as my grandfather told me that old dragon fly story fifteen or twenty times, I have already told my son the dragon fly story at least ten times, maybe more.  Hopefully, this helps him realize the importance of family and how our ancestors are to be thanked for the blessings and good fortune that we have in our lives today.  I can only hope that my son will grow up and have a family of his own to love and provide for and that he will tell that same old dragon fly story to his son or daughter as they’re flying their dragonfly tt487 remote control helicopters.

That is, of course, assuming that I don’t get to them first and tell my grandkids the story of the man who I admire the most and who has shaped my life and given me the strength to succeed in my everyday endeavors.
