Securing Dinner Reservations on Valentine’s Day

If you are planning to go out to dinner with your date on Valentine’s Day, you are probably already well aware of how many other people are also planning to go out to dinner to celebrate Valentine’s Day. This can make securing dinner reservations extremely difficult. Restaurants that accept reservations may fill up well before Valentine’s Day and those that do not accept reservations may have extremely long wait times for couples hoping for a table. If you already have reservations for this Valentine’s Day, you are lucky. For those who are not so fortunate this article will provide some useful information for securing dinner reservations on Valentine’s Day.

The most important tip for securing dinner reservations for Valentine’s Day is to make your reservations well in advance. If you want to take your date to an extremely popular restaurant you may have to make your reservations well in advance. It is highly unlikely you will be able to secure reservations on Valentine’s Day for later in the evening. However, there is always the possibility of a last minute cancellation but it is still a better idea to make your reservations in advance. How far in advance you make the reservations will depend on the popularity of the restaurant. For some restaurants you may make your reservations as early as February 15th of the previous year while for most restaurants a week or two beforehand should be early enough. 

If you are serious about wanting to go out to dinner to celebrate Valentine’s Day but are having difficulty making reservations try checking with less popular restaurants. For example if you live near a big city the restaurants in the city might all be completely booked but you may find availability in smaller restaurants outside the city limits. You may still have to make reservations but you may find you do not have to make them as early as you would for more popular restaurants in the city.

If you know someone who works as a host in a restaurant consider contacting them to find out about the reservation policy where they work. They may be able to offer you tips on how to make reservations and which times are likely to be the least crowded. They may even be able to do you a favor by squeezing you into an already packed Valentine’s Day schedule. You may not be rich or famous but if you happen to know someone who can help you out, you might find yourself enjoying a few benefits such as being able to make last minute reservations.

Finally, when making dinner reservations for Valentine’s Day you can consider making the reservations for earlier or later than usual. This may mean you are sitting down to enjoy your meal at a time which is not so convenient but it also likely means you will be able to make reservations as late as the day of Valentine’s Day. It also means there are likely to be fewer other people having dinner at this time. This usually translates to better service as well as a less stressful dining experience. If you know there are crowds waiting you may be more likely to rush your meal because you feel guilty. By taking advantage of early or late seatings you may avoid these feelings and wind up having a better time during your Valentine’s Day celebration.
