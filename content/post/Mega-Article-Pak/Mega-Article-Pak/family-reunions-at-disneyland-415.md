Family Reunions at Disneyland

Everyone looks forward to family reunions – and who 
doesn’t love Disneyland? You can bring the two 
together by having your family reunion at the happiest 
place on earth. It is really easier than you might think 
to arrange this!

Start by calling the Disneyland Vacation Planning 
Services Department. Let them help you book rooms 
at the Resort hotels, and admission tickets to the park. 
You should be able to get discounts on the tickets by 
purchasing them in bulk. 

The specific service that you need to accommodate 
all of your family members is the ‘Happiest Place on 
Earth Picnic.’ This service is offered year round, and 
includes admission to the park for your entire party. 
You also get a choice of fully catered meals for the 
event. For 100 – 300 people, your event can be held 
at Big Thunder Ranch. For 300 – 1000 people, the 
event will be held at the Festival Arena. 

If there are less than 100 people in your party, you 
may not be eligible for the catering services. This is 
at the sole discretion of Disneyland, and you will 
need to discuss this with Guest Services or the 
Planning Services Departments. If catering is not 
available, reservations in the many restaurants can 
be made instead.

You may be able to get a discount on your family 
member’s rooms at the Resorts as well, if you book 
well in advance, hold your event during the off-season, 
and book a block of rooms. Airline tickets for those 
who will need to fly to Disneyland should also be 
purchased well in advance, and in bulk for additional 
discounts. 

Again, allow Disneyland Vacation Planning Services 
to help you with the arrangements, and use a travel 
agent to handle any arrangements that planning 
services doesn’t cover. For best results, choose one 
family member to work with the planning services 
and the travel agent, and relay information back and 
forth between the services and the family members. 
Having one person collecting and sharing information 
will cut down on a great deal of confusion and 
misinformation when you are trying to make travel 
arrangements for a large number of people.

It may take work and planning, but in the end, this 
will be one family reunion that will never be forgotten. 
Talk with the Vacation Planning Services Department 
to find out what other services are available to make 
this an even more special experience for you and 
your family members. The Surprise services would 
be a nice touch!
