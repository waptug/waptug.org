How to Use the Promotional Tools on eBay

eBay wants you to be successful. Essentially, if 
their sellers are not making any money, eBay is 
not making any money – or not enough money. 
eBay does have one other very small source of 
revenue, which comes from the sellers. This revenue 
is realized from the promotional tools that actually 
help you, as a seller, have more successful auctions.

The promotional tools on eBay are very inexpensive. 
For instance, you can have a bold listing for just a 
few cents. Highlighted listings are equally inexpensive. 
These two tools could easily raise your final price by 
as much as 25%! Not all promotional tools cost money. 
Many of them are free. The available promotional tools 
found on eBay are product finder, gallery, bold, 
highlight, border, gift services listings, subtitles, featured 
home page, featured plus, featured gallery, keywords, 
co-op advertising, and optimized listings. 

If you are serious about making money from your eBay 
auctions, or if you are selling just one high ticket item, 
you should definitely take advantage of the eBay 
promotional tools that are available to you. These can 
easily be found through your sellers account.
