Essential Koi Pond Supplies

As a new Koi pond owner, you may be overwhelmed with the amount of supplies needed to properly maintain your Koi pond. While the importance of the majority of these items cannot be denied, the feeling of being overwhelmed by the amount needed should be disregarded. Simply knowing the function of each item can help you understand why they are needed.

There are certain items that you need to have on hand at all times. Because you pond is outdoors, emergency situations do occur. Nature is simply unpredictable at times, and you do not want to be caught in a situation where an item is needed, but they is no way to obtain it. 

Filters- Having a working filter is essential for removing unwanted pollutants, and maintaining proper water quality. If you do not have a proper filter, water quality issues can occur, which in turn will cause your fish to have health issues. 

Pump- A pump is essential to the health of your pond. If you water is not moving, there is no way the system can process the water. Moving water can also be from waterfalls, fountains, and other water features, but in no way should completely replace your pump.

Dechlorinator- Tap water contains chemicals that can potentially harm your fish. When adding new water for any reason, you must add Dechlorinator to eliminate these chemicals.

Test Kits- You will need to have ammonia and nitrite test kits on hand at all times. You will need to perform weekly water tests on your water to ensure proper water quality. Emergency tests may also be needed in the event that you notice discrepancies in your Koi behavior or in the water. 

Pond Salt and Baking Soda- Pond salt and baking soda are used to regulate kH and Nitrate levels in the event that you find a discrepancy. Pay close attention to the amounts you are suppose to add to your pond, which depends on size and the issues you are currently having. 
 
Bags- You must have the proper bags on hand to transport Koi. Do not attempt to transport your Koi in trash or regular plastic bags, as they are not designed for this, and may cause damage to your Koi. Unless you remembered to keep the bags you brought your koi home in originally, you will have to make a trip to your local pet store. Make sure to get bags sizable enough to hold your Koi.

Rubber Bands- You will need quite a few rubber bands for each bag you buy. Make sure that your rubber bands are good quality, as you do not want the pressure from the water to pop the rubber band in the middle of the transport.

Net- You will need to have a net sizeable enough to compete with your Koi. You will never need the net to pull the Koi out of the water with, but you will need it to lead and direct your Koi into the place you want them. Nets can potentially damage your Koi, especially as the larger they get.

Paint Bucket- A paint bucket is a better option for catching your Koi, as they cannot hurt your Koi like a net can. Make sure that your bucket is sizable enough to hold your Koi.

Koi Staple Food- Like any other pet, Koi need to be fed daily. Talk with your local pet store or Koi dealer when picking foods for your Koi, as different seasons may dictate the type of food you need to be feeding. Koi have even been known to eat out of their owner’s hand, so make sure to get food in which you are able to do this with.

Koi Treats and Snacks- Like other animals, Koi delight in treats, and will respond in a playful manner to them. Specific Koi treats are available at your local pet store. If you do not mind feeding “human” food to your pets, you may even consider feeding your Koi veggies, fruit, and bread.
