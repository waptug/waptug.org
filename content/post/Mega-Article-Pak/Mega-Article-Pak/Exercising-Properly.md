Exercising Properly

There are two main types of exercise that you can do -
aerobic and anaerobic.  The first one, aerobic, means
with oxygen.  Aerobic type exercise has an important
distinction, it burns fat as the main fuel.  

Anaerobic on the other hand, burns sugar as the
main source of fuel.  Despite common myths, exercise
doesn't have to be drastic in any way to provide
massive benefits.  Even if you choose light exercise,
you will still burn fat.

Light exercise will clear out lactic acid, which is
a waste of the body, and stimulate your cells to
regenerate.  To be sure that you are burning fat 
rather than sugar, it's very important to make sure
that you are doing several things as you exercise.

The most important thing you can do as you exercise
is breathe deep.  You should always breathe in deep
into your stomach through your nose, hold it for
a few seconds and then exhale hard through your
mouth.

Second, you should make sure that you exercise at
a comfortable level.  You should exercise at a level
of 7 out of 10, and still be able to carry on a
normal conversation while you exercise.  You should
do this for 45 minutes or so each day, then 
you'll begin to notice just how much your energy
will explode.

Even if you don't think you have the time to 
exercise, rest assured that there is always time.
If you have to, use the time that you would 
normally spend sleeping.  With exercising, you'll
actually need less sleep than before.

You can also use the time of your lunch break to
exercise as well.  The increase in productivity
will have you more on the ball, and you can save
your time through the dramatic increase in your
overall productivity.  

Cellularise, or rebounding, is one of the best
forms of aerobic exercise there is.  If you have
access to a rebounder, you shouldn't hesitate to
use it.  Use any break you have at work to engage
in some type of movement and deep breathing.

Any type of exercise you do will strongly benefit
your heart.  It will make it a stronger and larger
organ.  Deep breathing will help your lungs 
become stronger and larger as well.  There is
research now that links exercise to helping benefit
and almost prevent each and every type of disease
or ailment.

Movement of the joints will promote proper blood
flow and create energy, as sitting down all day
will rob your body of much needed energy.  If you 
sit down all day, it's very important that you
promote blood flow, circulation, energy, brain
flow, and the strength of your heart.  With just
a little bit of your time devoted to exercise,
you'll find yourself healthier than you have ever
been in the past.
