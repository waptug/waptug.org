Importance Of Recovery Planning

Disasters are common in the world today, from nature to car wrecks.  In the computer industry, disasters aren’t any different.  They can come in the form of an office fire, computer crashes, hard drive failure, missing IT documents, stolen hardware, and many other forms.  Disasters can be very traumatic and stressful, although there are actions that you can take.

Even though disasters can occur at any time, recovery planning doesn’t cross the mind of business owners or individuals.  Most just carry out their normal day to day routines, never aware of what could result from a disaster.  Then, when disaster does strike, most tend to freak out and wonder just what they can do to fix the situation at hand.

If you are prepared for a disaster or hard drive failure, then your business will be able to deal with anything that happens.  The first step in planning and preparing for disaster is to analyze your business or operations.  You should determine how often your systems go down, and how you can manage operations without the equipment.  You should also find out how long it would take you to fix the equipment, and what your business can do to make ends meet when the equipment is unavailable.

Something else you’ll need to do is identify the risks of possible disaster.  This can include computer failure, loss of power, hardware problems, etc.  You should always include the causes as well as the solution in your plans.  If your office suffers from disaster and cannot be used for a period of time, you should always have another location that you can go to continue your business.  

In the event of disaster, you should always have a dedicated team that will work on fixing any problems.  This team should be responsible for your recovery plan and hold regular meetings to make sure that everything is accurate.  Then, if disaster should strike, your team should be well enough prepared to take care of anything that comes your way.

On a frequent basis, you should create backups of your IT systems and test the backups that you have created.  Always make sure that the backups you made are in a safe place, and out of the way of harm.  You should also check with your disaster recovery team as well, and make sure that they have the location of your backups noted in their recovery plans.

One of the most important aspects of recovery and disaster planning is to keep an up to date inventory on all of your equipment and material.  You should always stay on top of this, to make sure that you can easily identify what you have and how to go about replacing equipment whenever something happens.  If you keep a record of your suppliers and their phone numbers, you can have them with you for easy access in the event of an emergency.

Even though it may be easier to document all of your recover plans on your computer, you should also record them on paper as well.  Disasters can render your computers useless, which would it very hard to access plans that are stored on your IT systems.  If you have them noted on paper as well, you can access them without any problems.

Above everything else, you should always think about the possible disasters that can occur at any time and how to be prepared for them.  If you think about things and plan things out before hand, you’ll find that you can handle any type of disaster.  This way - a disaster doesn’t have to stop you from carrying out your normal day to day operations.
