The GE Monogram Wine Chiller

Wine is a flavorful and unique beverage that usually complements an exquisite dinner cuisine. Ranging from white Chardonnay wine to red Merlot, these drinks add a little more excitement to your meal. And they don't always have to be served with food either; they can stand alone at parties or other formal social gatherings.

Some people are just crazy about wine. It might be due to the extreme care and effort required to create wine that sparks this passion, or even the other way around. Others might be connoisseur wine tasters that test out a variety of wines as their hobby. Whatever the case, these people surely collect a lot of wine.

Where would they store their wine, though? Although a refrigerator may be good enough for the average person, it may not suit one who takes care of their wine. There may not even be enough space for someone to place all their wine bottles if the person is really into the world of wine. So, what would be a suitable place, then? That's where a General Electric Monogram wine chiller comes in handy.

A wine chiller is appropriate, but why a GE Monogram one? What's so special about it? Well, the GE Monogram not only chills wine, but it does it in style. The GE Monogram appliances are designed with both functionality and appearance in mind. That means you'll have a great asset to your household décor and your wine. A GE Monogram wine chiller makes that possible.

A quick glance at a GE Monogram wine chiller will reveal a slick looking glass door that displays the wine bottles currently in store. Behind the door are seven cherry wood shelves that look like they could match a nearby cabinet or table. These shelves are placed for maximum space efficiency, but you can always remove one if you have to accommodate bigger wine bottles.

You can always customize your Monogram wine chiller to get the specific taste that you seek. The shelves of the base models have unfinished wood, but you can choose finished ones if it helps in adding to the look of your household. Also, if you're feeling adventurous, you can get a special glass door. This door allows you to set the glass between transparent and opaque.

Taking a closer look at the features, the GE Monogram wine chillers allow total control over the interior temperature. An adjustable temperature control allows you to maintain the ideal conditions for your wine. This comes in handy when you want to create the conditions to serve your wine or age it. There is an LED readout that lets you know the current temperature of the wine chiller.

If you need a place to keep your wine secure and chilled and the fridge just isn't cutting it, try a GE Monogram wine chiller. Engineered for functionality and attraction, this appliance will more than meet your needs. It offers a sophisticated look and feel that simply blows ordinary wine chillers out of the water.
