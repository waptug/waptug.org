Get your Project Done Faster with a Power Sander

Sanding is a common part of many projects, especially painting. It helps to get the area prepped and smooth. Using a power sander will get the job done with excellent results in a lot less time. It will save your arms some hard work as well. They are many types of sanders available. Make sure you change the sandpaper or disc often to get the best results and further reduce the amount of time the sanding project takes you. 

You want to use one with a high level of power and that fits well in your hand. You may wish to have a large sander for big jobs and a smaller one for small areas and finishing touches. Sanders can be with a cord or cordless. For most jobs, you can sand with and against the grain. Don’t put too much pressure on the sander as you use it. This will only hinder its performance. Keep a firm grip on it but the sanders should be able to move freely. Some sanders offer a warning light that tells you when you are using too much pressure. 

A belt sander, just as the name implies, uses a belt to remove the materials. The handles are designed to help you manipulate the power tool without too much pressure on your part. Disc sanders are commonly used for grinding. They require a stone or disc depending on the material you are working with. 

Orbit sanders use sandpaper. It comes in a variety of sizes and grades. The grade of sandpaper is determined by the number of sand granules on each square inch of the sand paper.  The lower grade numbers mean it is coarser. Higher grade numbers mean the paper is finer. To cut your time down, start with a very coarse sandpaper. As you are about to complete the project switch to finer sandpapers to give you a great finish. Make sure you use the right type of sandpaper for the material you are working with. Sandpaper is very inexpensive so it is a good idea to buy a variety of grades and types to have on hand. 

A finish sander is a very small power tool, but it is very efficient. It also uses sandpaper. It is a good type of sander to work for finishing work. A detail sander is your best option for tight corners. It has a triangle shaped tip so it can get in to places other sanders can’t reach. 

Sanders result in a great deal of dust particles remaining. Make sure you wear eye protection. A respirator is recommended as well to prevent you from inhaling the dust. This is especially important if you are working at an angle where the dust is coming directly down on you, such as overhead sanding. You can also choose to purchase a dust bag for the sander. 

Wearing long sleeves is a good idea as well. Some of the products you may be sanding could have chemicals or the paint could contain lead. These dangerous materials could enter your skin through the pores. Make sure you have a well ventilated work area and that cords and other objects are out of the way.

Sanders are great for getting materials ready to stain or paint. Make sure you thoroughly clean up all the dust before you begin to paint or sand. Any remaining particles of dust from the sanding can get trapped in the paint or stain, and it will be noticeable when your item has finished drying.
