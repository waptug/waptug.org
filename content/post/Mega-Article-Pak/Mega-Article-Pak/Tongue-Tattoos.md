Tongue Tattoos

Tattoos are a hot commodity these days, becoming more and more popular than they have ever been in the past.  There are hundreds and thousands of different designs and styles of tattoos to choose from, giving you the chance to express yourself.  Although tattoos are very popular, the new trend that is rapidly taking effect in the world of tattoos is known as tongue tattoos.

Although many aren’t familiar with tongue tattoos yet, they are just now starting to take shape.  They resemble other designs and styles, although they cover the muscle known as the tongue.  There are tattoos that cover the entire tongue, or just a single area.  In most cases, those who already have them, chose to have their tongue tattooed a certain color.  Whether it be purple, orange, black, or blue, the tongue can be tattooed a variety of different colors.

The designs that are poplar with tongue tattoos include stars, tribal work, and other shapes and designs that cover a region of the tongue.  Stars are popular with the lower area of the tongue, near the tip.  There are also designs that can be tattooed farther back on the tongue, near the middle of it.  As tongue tattoos become more and more popular, more and more designs are implemented.

As far as the procedure goes, it’s very similar to getting a tattoo on any other part of your body.  A tattoo involved needles puncturing the skin, depositing ink into the epidermis.  The needles move extremely fast, breaking the skin and leaving the pigments of ink.  The tongue, just like the skin, will swallow the pigments once the surface has been punctured by the needle.  Once the pigments of ink are absorbed by the tongue, the color will remain there forever.

Those who have had tongue tattoos in the past say that they aren’t very painful.  Unlike tattoos on the skin, the tongue is a giant muscle.  A tattoo on the tongue is often described as a tickling sensation or the feeling of numbness in your mouth.  When the tattoo artist does the tattoo, he will normally use a tool to hold the tongue out.  If you’ve ever had a tongue piercing, you’ll know what it looks like.  Once the tongue is out, the artist will begin work.  The process normally does take very long, as long you hold still and don’t move around.

If a tongue tattoo sounds interesting to you, the first thing to do is find a tattoo artist in your area who is experienced with doing them.  Not a lot of tattoo artists are familiar with tongue tattoos, as they are just now beginning to surface.  A tongue tattoo is a bit on the creative side – something that you just don’t see in public everyday.
