Secured Personal Loans

Personal loans provide borrowers with the opportunity to access funds for those areas in their life that need some assistance or where additional funding would work to their benefit. A secured personal loan is a type of personal loan that involves the borrower having to provide some type of collateral to the lender as assurance that they will repay the loan. This is due to the borrower falling into a high risk category. There are pros and cons to accepting a secured personal loan that we will explore further.

High risk in regard to loan repayment can mean a variety of things. It can mean you have an unsteady income, including self employment where the amount of income you have coming in varies each month. While the lender can see you have an income source, it is not considered to be a reliable as getting a regular paycheck. The decision will depend on the regulations of the lender, length of time you have been self employed, and the loan amount you are requesting. 

High risk in terms of a secured personal loan generally imply the borrower has either poor credit or has not established enough of a credit history for a decision to be made. Poor credit can be the result of poor money management or circumstances that took place in your life which you had no control over. Some individuals think it is very unfair to be penalized for not having an established credit history. I agree that it can be frustrating, because you can’t really be expected to establish a credit history if no one will give you credit. 

In either situation, use the opportunity of a secured personal loan as a way to prove yourself worthy of lenders working with in the future. Your credit is an area that is going to make or break you down the road, so use your opportunities wisely. A secured personal loan that is repaid as scheduled or sooner can help you on the road to re-establishing your credit worthiness or start your newly documented credit history of to an amazing start. Secured personal loans can offer opportunities to those individuals who would not be eligible for any other types of loans the chance to have the funding they need. 

On the flip side, secured personal loans can be risky. It is very crucial that you understand that risk. Since you will be required to provide collateral for the loan, any default could result in you losing your home, other property, vehicle, whatever it was that you used as collateral on the loan. While entering the contract of a secured personal loan, no one really anticipates the loss of their collateral. It can be very damaging to an individual when the lender comes to collect that collateral.

To protect yourself, be realistic with your financial endeavors. You will need to ask yourself some tough questions and be honest with the answers. If you have a pattern of not being able to fully commit to financial obligations, then do not create further financial hardships for yourself or your family by becoming involved with a secured personal loan. 

As yourself exactly how much you need to borrow and for what purpose, then stick to those terms. It can be tempting to borrow more when you need $5,000 and the lender tells you that he can approve the loan for $10,000. Don’t let your common sense and judgment be clouded by dollar signs. 

Secured personal loans can be a great means of generating necessary revenue for those in need. They offer an opportunity for individuals to establish or re-establish a good credit rating. However, caution should be taken to protect against losing the collateral for this type of loan from being lost to the lender. If you are eligible for an unsecured personal loan, it involves less risk though you will incur a higher interest rate.
