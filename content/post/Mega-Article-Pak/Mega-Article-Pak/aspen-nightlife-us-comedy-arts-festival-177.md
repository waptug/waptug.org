Aspen Nightlife – US Comedy Arts Festival

If you can visit Aspen in March, make sure that you 
catch the US Comedy Arts Festival that is held in 
various venues throughout Aspen. This is one of the 
major events for comedians all over the country – 
and it is some of the best entertainment you will 
ever experience. 

The US Comedy Arts Festival features every type of 
comedy you can imagine, including Stand-up 
comedy, film shorts, alternative comedy, and sketch 
comedy. Tribute is given to some of the greatest 
comedians from the past, such as Rodney 
Dangerfield, Monty Python, and George Carlin. You 
will also have the opportunity to enjoy many of 
today’s famous comedians, and hear some unknown 
or up and coming comedians as well.

Make sure that you don’t miss this festival – and 
make sure that you make your plans and reservations 
very early. The lodges and hotels will fill up fast for 
this festival, and according to locals, this is the 
hardest time of the year to find lodging in Aspen – 
which is a good indication of how good the 
entertainment is!
