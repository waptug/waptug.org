La Jolla Village

The Village of La Jolla is the vacation showcase of
La Jolla.  The village offers postcard type beauty,
with elegant homes, lush real estate, resorts,
luxurious hotels, and even the best in intimate
bed and breakfast lodging.  The La Jolla Village is
the gateway entrance to some of the most amazing
beaches San Diego has to offer.

The village consists of a 30 block downtown La 
Jolla area that's home to over 1,400 businesses
that are fully committed to vacation pleasure to
the over 7,000 people that visit the village each
and every day.  

In the village you'll find all the conveniences
that grace the shores, such as world class shopping
and quaint boutique shops.  Upscale restaurants,
intimate cafes, museums, art galleries, and 
attractions such as the Birch Aquarium can be found
here as well.

The La Jolla Playhouse is in the village as well.
It has earned over 200 awards, including the 1993
Tony for outstanding regional theater.  The Playhouse
is a creative haven that attracts more then 150,000
theater enthusiasts each year.  

Most visitors to the La Jolla Village like to walk
the shoreline around Scripps Park and soak up the
perfect weather and majestic views of the oceanfront
panorama.  If romantic tranquility is what you 
seek, late afternoon and early evening strolls are
less crowded and at dusk you can catch some of
the most stunning sunsets.

The beaches of La Jolla are the biggest tourist
attractions here.  All you need to do is choose 
your style of water recreation and relaxation.  
Swimming, surfing, bodysurfing, snorkeling, scuba
diving, sun bathing, or just watching others swim.
Make sure you arrive early to avoid the crowds,
then stay late to catch the beauty of the moonlit
skies.

La Jolla Golden Triangle
The Golden Triangle of La Jolla is an area that's
intersected by three major freeways - I-5, I-805,
and State 52.  The Triangle lies east of La Jolla
Village and ten minutes north of downtown San
Diego.  

The established residential community blossomed
into a financial triad of high rise office 
buildings, full service hotels, shopping, and
plenty of restaurants.  

The Golden Triangle also offers the business
traveler and vacationer all they need within a
self contained area of business, retail, shopping,
hotels, dining, and boutiques.  The Golden Triangle
is also located close to the oceanfront beach 
area of the village and all the vacation attractions
that San Diego has to offer.
