Google Video:  Why It Is So Popular

Online video sites have rapidly increased in popularity over the past few years.  One of those websites is known as Google Video.  Have you ever wondered why online video websites, including Google Video, are so popular? If so, you are not alone. Despite the fact that millions of internet users enjoying watching online videos, many wonder what created all the buzz.

When it comes to understanding the popularity of Google Video, there are a number of different factors that come into play.  Google Video, like most other websites, has unique features about it. Those features are what brings in new internet users and keeps the old ones coming back for more. Therefore, Google Video is not only popular among first time video watchers, but ones that have been watching online videos for some time now.

Perhaps, one of the greatest reasons why Google Video is so popular is because of all of the choices that internet users, just like you, have. With Google Video, you are not only allowed to watch the videos that are hosted on the site, but you can also create your own.  This means that you can create your own video; on just about anything that you want, even if you do not have any formal video making experience.  The good news is that with Google Video’s popularity, it is likely that your video will be viewed by thousands of internet users.

In addition to the wide variety of different choices, when it comes to using the website, you also have a number of different choices when it comes to paying for it.  Google Video, like many other online video websites, offers a collection of videos that are free to watch. In addition to offering videos free of charge, Google Video also has a collection of videos that you must pay for; however, they are optional to watch. These videos are often longer or have well-known celebrities in them.  It is nice that you don’t have to pay for these videos, especially if you don’t want to watch them.  If you would prefer to not pay for an online video, you still have a number of different choices. There should be plenty of other free videos for you to choose from.

In fact, the videos that you can choose from are just another one of the many reasons why Google Video has become one of the most well known online video websites.  Popular video categories include music videos, television shows, animation, movies, comedy, and sports.  Additional categories are also available.  In fact, there are too many categories to list. Basically, this means that you should be able to find whatever you want to watch online with Google Video.

It is also important to note that the site is easy to use. There are too many online websites, including a number of popular online video websites, which are difficult to use and navigate. This is not the case with Google Video.  If you are looking for a particular video, you can easily search for it or browse through all of Google’s categories.  Once you select the video that you would like to watch, it will load in no time at all. After you have watched the video, you can easily rate the video, if you choose to do so, in a matter of seconds.  

If you haven’t already checked out Google Video, you are encouraged to do so. All of the above mentioned reasons are reasons why the website has become one of the most popular video websites online.  If Google Video impresses thousands, if not millions, of other internet users, there is a good chance that it will impress you as well.
