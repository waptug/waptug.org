eBay Sellers:  The Importance of Communication

Are you an eBay seller?  If you just recently became an eBay seller, you may still be learning the ins and outs of eBay, particularly how to make a profit.  While there are an unlimited number of tips that could help increase your chances of making a profit on eBay, like detailed product descriptions and such, there is one way that is relatively simple; having an open line of communication with all of your eBay buyers.  Although you may not necessarily think about it at the time, communication goes a long way when it comes to online business transactions, particularly on eBay.

When it comes to keeping an open line of communication with your customers or potential customers, there are three main situations that you should take advantage of. First, if you are selling a popular item, you may have a number of bids or even a number of questions.  If your product description wasn’t very detailed, it shouldn’t come as a surprise to you to have messages from other eBay members seeking more information.  While some of these questions may be good, valid ones, others may seem a little bit out in left field. In fact, some eBay member questions may leave you wondering if they even looked at your auction listing. Still, it is advised that you answer all user questions in a polite and timely matter.  Doing so will increase the chances of your item or items being sold.

Once an eBay buyer has agreed to buy an item from you, whether it be through a traditional auction listing or a “Buy It Now,” sale, you will want to send your customer an invoice, showing the total amount of money that they owe you. After you have received payment, there is a good chance that you will box up the items sold and head to the post office.  A great way to make a good impression is to send your customers an update email; an email that can let them know that their items were just shipped.  Many eBay buyers like this because it gives them an estimated arrival time frame.  Should you have purchased a package tracking number, you will want supply your customers with that information.

It is also advised that you follow through, within a few days or a week, to see if your customers received their items.  You may also want to send a personal note asking them how they liked the items and such.  One thing that you definitely want to include in a follow-up message is a thank you note.  You will want to thank each of your eBay customers for doing business with you. You should also state that you hope to do business with them again.  In today’s society, many consumers are not thanked for their business anymore, although many wish that they still were.  Sending a thank you follow-up note will only take a few minutes of your time, but it is something that your customers will likely remember for sometime to come.    
	
As it was stated above, having an open line of communication may increase your eBay profits.  Why you may ask?  Well, you need to think of it from a consumer standpoint.  If you could shop at two different retail stores, which both had the same products available for the same prices, which store would you choose?  If you are like most consumers, you would respond with the store with the best customer service.  eBay is no different.  With competition increasing each day, you need to be able to set yourself apart from other eBay sellers.  The best way to do this is to go the extra mile for your customers.  

Keeping an open line of communication before, during, and after each sale will help give you a good, positive reputation among many eBay buyers.  It will also likely result in return customers; customers who can help to increase your eBay profits.
