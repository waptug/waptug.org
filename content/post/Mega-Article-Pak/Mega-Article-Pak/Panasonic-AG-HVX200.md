Panasonic AG-HVX200

The Panasonic AG-HVX200 is a handheld HD p2 camera
recorder that's designed to meet the emerging needs
needs in HD content production.  The camera debuts
and remains Panasonic's first HD video product to
use P2, the cutting edge memory recording device
that has the potential to revolutionize the entire
production paradigm.

The AG-HVX200 can record HD, in either 1080i or 
720p video acquired by a new optical system and
high performance digital signal processor onto a P2
card using the broadcasting DVCPRO HD codec.  This
very system achieves a level of image quality that
conventional handheld HD cameras simply can't match,
while also supporting HD/SD multi-format and multi
codec recording capabilities.

The visual frame rate recording is just one of the
many features that makes this camera so very unique
in its class.  By using technology that makes the
Panasonic VariCam camera a favorite in movie
production, this powerful function will allow the
overcranking techniques used with film cameras 
to create fast motion and slow motion effects.

The P2 card offers you superb reliability, immediate
playback, and amazing cost performance.  It will 
also allow direct connection to other editing
systems and streamlines the production work flow,
by providing to the editing system data files
ready to be edited, rather than a video tape 
that would require the tedious task of digitizing.

On top of all the advanced features and technology,
the Panasonic AG-HVX200 inherits the refined 
design and easy operation that seperates it from
the rest.  With the AG-HVX200 HD camera, 
professionals of all kinds will find a powerful
tool to help them create and bring their creations
to life - helping them achieve things they may
have never thought to be possible.
