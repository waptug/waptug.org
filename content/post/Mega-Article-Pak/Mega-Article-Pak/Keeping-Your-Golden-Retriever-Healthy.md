Keeping Your Golden Retriever Healthy

Once you have helped your Golden Retriever build up his immune system, he will be healthy and strong enough to fend off any type of illness.  There are ways that you can help your Golden with his immune system, which is more or less what you feed him.  If you care about your Golden Retriever and want to help him develop a strong immune system - you’ll find this information very helpful.

When you feed your Golden, give him some homemade food.  You can substitute this for canned food, or mix it in together.  Homemade food tastes a lot better to your dog, and it contains a lot of the nutrients and vitamins he needs.  When you give him water, give him spring water.  Although many prefer to give their Golden water from the faucet, spring water is actually a lot better for him than any other type of water.

When you give him a treat or a bone, you should always give him raw bones with plenty of meat on the bone, as they will help him to develop a strong set of white teeth.  Teeth are very important with Golden Retrievers, which is why you want to make sure that his teeth stay strong and healthy.  If you give him a bone a day, he will have plenty to chew on to keep his teeth healthy.	You can also use chew toys as well, especially when you are playing with him, as they will help him to develop strength in his jaws.

You can also help to keep your Golden Retriever healthy by knowing a bit about health problems that he could have.  This way, you’ll able to keep track of what your vet diagnoses.  If your vet tells you something that is wrong with your Golden, you should know a little bit about what he tells you, and how you can help to take care of the problem.

To help your Golden Retriever avoid any type of reproductive problems, you should look into having a male neutered.  Reproductive problems are common with Golden’s, and can lead to more serious problems if you don’t do something about it.  If you aren’t planning to breed your Golden Retriever, you should have him neutered as soon as you can, to help prevent any type of reproductive problems.

If you take care of your dog and keep him healthy, he will live a lot longer.  You should always strive to keep your dog healthy, so he can live a pain free life.  As long as you feed him a proper diet and let him get plenty of exercise, he will stay strong and healthy.  Golden Retrievers that grow to be strong and healthy make great pets, as they can join you in exercise and provide plenty of fun for your entire family.
