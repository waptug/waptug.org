Sewing Wahm business

Are you handy with a needle and thread? Do you enjoy sewing clothes for yourself or your children? Are friends and relatives always asking you to make sewing repairs? If so, then you have the perfect beginnings for a work at home sewing business.

Sewing is a skill that is coming back into fashion as more people seek to reduce their clothing costs and make the clothes that they have last longer. Many Wahms find profitable businesses in offering their sewing skills to people who don’t have the time or the skill to make repairs or alterations on their clothes. There are even several profitable sewing niches, like cloth diapers and slings, which have found interest online.

Getting started with your sewing business starts with deciding what you want to do. You can specialize in one type of sewing (bridal party gowns) or you can take a wide variety of jobs. Since it is your business, it is totally up to you how to run it. Some people specialize in children’s clothing, alterations/repairs, women’s clothing or formal wear. Although sewing clothing is the most profitable field, many Wahms enjoy offering home décor services and make curtains, slipcovers and other home accents. 

Before you start advertising, make sure that you have the supplies that you’ll need. If you have an older sewing machine that has “bad days” when it doesn’t work right, you might want to consider getting a new machine so you can work more efficiently. The cost of a new machine is worth it compared to the time that you’ll save. Plus, the new sewing machine is a tax write-off. You probably already have the sewing notions that you’ll need to get started. If you need something for a specific project, you’ll just buy it at the time.

You’ll also need to decide on set prices before you begin advertising your services. If you are doing repairs, you can charge a certain price per task. If you are custom sewing clothing, you can either charge a flat fee or charge by the hour. For larger projects, like wedding dresses, charging by the hour can work out to be a better deal for both you and the client. 

Start your business off on the right foot by getting a business license. You’ll want to make sure that everything is legal and that you keep accurate records of your expenses and income. There are also several tax deductions that you can take as a business owner, and you’ll have access to wholesale sewing supplies.

Make some business cards to distribute to people you know. Also, leave them at certain places around town depending on what type of sewing you are specializing in. For example, if you sew children’s clothing, you can arrange to have your cards available at local daycare centers. One of the most powerful ways to advertise your business is through word of mouth. Your friends, family and acquaintances will surely send clients your way once they know you’ve hung your shingle up for business.

Having a sewing business is a great way to do something that you love, help other people and make some money all at the same time. There are many Wahm jobs to choose from, but having a sewing business definitely offers the best deal for those who love to sew.
