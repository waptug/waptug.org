Music CD-R And Data CD-R

People who are new to computers and duplication, will
sometims confuse CD-R music media with CD-R data
media.  While confusing them is easy to do, the
two are different indeed.  Even if you have some
experience with computers, confusing them is very
easy to do.

As you may or may not know, there are differences
between music CD-R and data CD-R disks.  The obvious
difference is, of course, the name.  With one 
named CD-R music and one named CD-R data, you 
know there has to be some type of difference 
between the two.

What's known is that there are indeed technical
differences in what is embedded in blank music
CDs when compared to blank data CDs.  These 
differences center upon bytes that are within
the sub channels of the blank music disks.  

This doesn't affect the quality, as both audio
and data can be duplicated onto both music CD-R
disks and data CD-R disks.  You can burn data onto 
music CD-R, and music onto data CD-R media 
without any problems.  Keep in mind, whether or
not you get data on a music CD-R will depend
on what type of hardware you use to duplicate
the CD.

If you plan to use a PC to do all of your burning,
it won't matter.  A PC doesn't differentiate
between music CD-R and data CD-R.  PCs will see
a blank media CD and duplicate information on it
that pertains to the settings you have outlined
in the software you plan to use to burn the CD.

If you plan to use a seperate CD burner, it
may or may not let you burn data or music on
a generic blank or data CD-R.  Some hardware
are funny like that, as they only want you to
use blank media with well known brand names
that they have approved of.

If you plan to do most of your CD duplication
on a computer, it really doesn't matter which
type of blank CD-R you use.  They will both 
work fine in most cases when you store either
music or data.  When storing data, you have a
limit of 700 MB, while music will have a limit
of a little over an hour of tunes.

For your duplication needs, computers are the
ideal way to copy media.  You can use equipment
outside of a computer and CD burner, although
you'll need to check the operations manual 
and see what they recommend for media.  If you
have a computer or access to one, it can do
wonders in the areas of music and data CD-R
duplication.
