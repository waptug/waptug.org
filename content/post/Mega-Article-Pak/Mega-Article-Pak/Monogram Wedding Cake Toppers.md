Monogram Wedding Cake Toppers

Using a monogram is a classic method to customize the look and feel of many items. An embroidered monogram in clothing can give it the extra appeal that you require in an office setting. Monogram stationery adds your own unique taste when you write letters or leave memos for others.

Monograms aren't just for clothes and paper, either. They're an excellent way to add a professional and elegant atmosphere to a social gathering. Monogram napkins are a great way to add class to a wedding. Also, you can use a monogram design for wedding cake toppers.

Monogram wedding cake toppers are an interesting change to the typical bride and groom adornment that is found on most cakes. With a specially designed wedding cake topper, you can build onto the atmosphere or theme that you're looking for. At the very least, you can get rid of the ordinary bride and groom ornament and add a little pizzazz to your cake.

Creating your own custom monogram wedding cake topper couldn't be easier. Many stores have preset designs for you to pick and choose from. If you need something simple but stylish, you can browse through the different types of lettering that is offered. Or maybe you require a look that only a specific material can fulfill. In that case, you can choose between items such as solid brushed metal or gold acrylic mirror.

Make sure to choose the right color for your monogram wedding cake topper as well. There exists a wide variety of colors to choose from. If you desire something that stands out, you can go with a ruby or topaz look. If that's too fancy for you, there are more simple choices such as gold or silver.

There are many types of monogram wedding cake toppers for you to decide on. A crystal covered single letter monogram adds a touch of beauty to your wedding cake. A ceramic cake topper can also yield the same atmosphere while producing a different effect altogether. The possibilities are limitless.

Where would one start their search for these exquisite items? A wedding supplies and accessories store should have a few of these items in stock. You may have to look around though, especially if you are looking for something specific. Be sure to ask friends and family if they know any good wedding shops.

Being a highly unique accessory, monogram wedding cake toppers can be expensive. Depending on where you shop, you might be paying for the number of letters, the size, or the amount of decoration on the cake topper. Of course, hosting a wedding is a rare lifetime event, so don't be afraid to spare no expense. It will be worth it when you get the design you're looking for.

Don't omit any small details when the time comes to plan and host your wedding. If you need a small decoration to spruce up your wedding cake, try a monogram wedding cake topper. A simple detail might just make your wedding a whole lot memorable.
