Aspen Nightlife – Aspen Recreation Center

While the Aspen Recreation Center closes just 
before 9pm, there is quite a bit of enjoyment to be 
had here after a day on the slopes. If you get there 
right after leaving the slopes, and eat a late dinner 
– after the center closes – you will have plenty of 
time to enjoy what the ARC has to offer.

The climbing walls at the center are the biggest 
attraction. The ARC features approximately 3100 feet 
of climbing walls for your enjoyment. There is also a 
3-D climbing tower with more than 25 routes and four 
auto belays. 

Another nice feature at the Aspen Recreation Center 
is the pool area. The James E. Moore Pool area 
features two pools. One pool is 25 yards in length 
and features six lanes, while the other pool is for 
recreation and has a two story slide, a lazy river, and 
spray features. You will also find a dry sauna, a steam 
room, and hot tubs in the pool area.

The Lewis Ice Arena is also located at the Aspen 
Recreation Center. Completed in the Spring of 2003, 
the arena features an NHL regulation size skating 
surface, grandstand seating for 450, a skate shop, 
locker rooms, and shower rooms. Public skating, 
skating lessons, figure skating, youth and adult 
hockey, and skating shows are available. You can 
also host private parties at the arena. High altitude 
training is also offered here.

You will also find cardio and weight rooms at the 
center, and many fitness classes are also offered. 
The Aspen Recreation Center hosts many off-site 
activities in the Aspen area as well, such as golf, 
tennis, climbing, aquatics, sailing, skateboarding, 
ceramics classes, baseball, softball, soccer, 
hockey, and various camps. 

Babysitting services are available at the center as 
well. This place is a great way to wrap up a day of 
activity and wind down before your evening meal. 
Again, the Aspen Recreation Center closes just 
before 9pm, so make sure you head there right after 
leaving the slopes for the day.

Admission for guests is $13 for youths and $15 for 
adults. Admission includes access to the climbing 
towers, swimming pool area, ice skating rink, weight 
room, cardio room, adult fitness classes, water 
aerobics, climbing wall and playhouse, and tennis 
courts. The Aspen Recreation Center is a great place 
for every member of the family. Call ahead to find out 
about any planned events that are going on for even 
more entertainment options.
