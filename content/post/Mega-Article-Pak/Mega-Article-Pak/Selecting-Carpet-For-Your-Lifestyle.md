Selecting Carpet For Your Lifestyle

Whenever you select carpet, you have to consider many
aesthetic as well as technical areas.  With well over
a hundred thousands styles and colors being released
every year, selecting the right carpet to match your
needs can be a very challenging task indeed.

Carpet is available in several different textures, 
constructions, colors, and designs - which will open
the doors to virtually any interior design that you
can imagine.  The combination of texture and color
will complement the look of both formal and casual
environments, while helping to bring continuity to
the overall room designs.

The most important thing to consider when you shop
for carpet is the amount of traffic that will be
on the carpet that is going to be installed as well
as the area you hope to use it in.  The construction
and the texture are both key aspects when you 
select a carpet for a specified area and use.

Nylon, polyester, and olefin are the mosty widely
used fibers with carpet manufacturing, with each
one displaying qualities that make themselves great
with specific applications and uses. Even though
nylon is the most expensive type of fiber, it is
also the softest and most resilient, which makes
it great for any room in your home, including those
areas that have a high level of traffic.

Polyester fabric is less resilient than nylon, 
although it more cost efficient and offers a 
high level of resistance to stains, which makes it
a great choice for areas such as bedrooms or dining
rooms that are not subjet to a lot of traffic.

The fiber olefin is solution dyed, which results
in a highly resistant stain carpet that can be 
cleaned easily using a water and beach solution -
without any loss to the color.  

Unlike the other types of fibers, olefin is fade,
mildew, and mold resistant, which results in a
carpet that performs well indoors and outdoors.
Keep in mind however, that olefin isn't very 
resilient and as a result, it should only be 
considered with berber construction.

You can get carpets in either plush or berber
construction.  The berber type of carpets are well
constructed with a continuous level loop, while
plush carpets are constructed of loops that have
been sheared, which results in the strands standing
upright.

Berber construction carpets don't crush or matt,
due to their high level loops.  They are however
harder underfoot, uncomfortable to sit on or lay
down on, and they can easily become damaged by
pets with long nails.  Berber carpets are well 
suited for high traffic areas, which include walk
ways, living rooms, and entrance areas.  They aren't
popular with bedrooms, as their hard texture makes
them a less than attractive option.

The plush type carpets are much softer to walk or
lay on and they offer better sound and thermal
insulation.  They tend to crush and matt though
when they are subjected to high levels of foot
traffic.

The use of nylon fiber paired with a tight low pile
construction will help to limit the amount of pile
and matt crushing, due to the high resilient nature
of the nylon fiber and the added support that is
gained from tight construction.

The warranties for carpet ranges from 5 - 30 years,
with the general rule being that you don't cover
the stairs.  Most carpet warranties will require
the installation of new carpet padding as well at
the time of installation in order for the warranty
to become valid.
