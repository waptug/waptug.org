How To Choose The Best Golf Clubs For A Particular Game

The most important part of playing a game of golf is choosing the right club. Even if your stroke technique leaves something to be desired, if you choose the right club you can often compensate for this. There are many things you have to decide on when you are choosing golf clubs, but once you start to see the patterns emerging you will be able to always choose the right one without even thinking about it too much. This is the mark of a truly skilled golfer, and it is the one way that you can start improving in a very quick and noticeable way. So read on to find out about what you need to look for and do.

People who don’t golf often have a hard time believing that all 14 clubs in a golfer’s bag will come in handy at some point. However, as you golf more and more you will see that there is a distinct situation in which every one will come in handy. When you start, your golf bag should be made up of drivers, wedges, putters, and irons. Each of them is used several times throughout every game, and most are made to correct strokes that aren’t made perfectly. All beginning clubs are designed this way – this is why it is not a good idea to choose clubs that are outside of your skill level, since they will be less forgiving when you make a mistake.

The handicap of a golfer will play a huge role in determining what kinds of clubs he carries. If you usually score around 10 strokes over par, your bag will look significantly different than someone who scores over 100 strokes over par (which, despite sounding ridiculous, is usually fairly standard for those who are new to the game). Golfers in this category will usually have a bag that reflects a preference for woods rather than irons, because of the heightened levels of accuracy that woods provide. The golfers with a higher skill level will have clubs that are less able to correct mistakes, and more likely to just send the ball rocketing in whatever direction it is sent in. This is why they take a higher skill level to master.

Hybrid clubs or adjustable clubs are also very valuable for beginners who have not yet gotten a grasp on their own playing style. Hybrid golf clubs are somewhere in between woods and irons. They provide accuracy due to their relatively short lengths, and they provide sheer distance with their specially designed heads that are usually very light and hollow. They are very unique and take some getting used to, but if you can try one out at the store before you buy it, you may discover that it adds a whole new element to your game.

All of these golf clubs play a very important part from getting you down the fairway right to the green and into the hole. Without one of them, you would have to use a different club to do something it wasn’t meant to. Therefore you should pay plenty of attention to all of the things that I have stated so far, and you will find that golf becomes a much more enjoyable sport to you.
