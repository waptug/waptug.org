Aspen Nightlife – The Ultimate Taxi

This isn’t your ordinary taxi ride! The Ultimate Taxi 
is actually entertainment that is not to be missed. 
This is a thirty to forty minute musical ride around 
Aspen – but it’s not like any other ride you will take 
in your lifetime.

The taxi you will be riding in is a 1978 Checker cab. 
It has been greatly modified and boasts four red 
lasers, a laser projector, black light effects, light 
washers, light orbs, mini-strobes, color changing fiber 
optics, a sound system, stage lights, a mirror ball, a 
fog machine, a keyboard, digital drums, a digital 
camera, a DV cam, a notebook computer, a printer, 
and much, much more. 

Your driver will be Jon Barnes, and he has been 
driving tourists around Aspen since 1984. He throws 
in a pair of 3-D glasses, so you can view Aspen as 
you never have before. Featured online, in radio 
interviews, magazines, and newspapers, the Ultimate 
Taxi has become very popular. Many famous people 
have taken this cab ride as well, including Clint 
Eastwood and Jerry Seinfeld. 

Get ready for a wild ride! Jon plays the keyboard 
and the horn while driving! With your 3-D glasses 
and the other toys that are included in the ride, 
combined with the psychedelic lighting effects, this 
is one ride that you will never forget! In fact, Jon 
makes sure of it, because there will be pictures to 
help you remember the event.

Make sure you buy some souvenirs before you leave. 
The Ultimate Taxi gift store is located right outside 
the doors, in the trunk. You will also have a web page 
memory of your ride in the Ultimate Taxi hosted on 
Jon’s server for all time. Take your toys and 3-D 
glasses home with you as well.

The Ultimate Taxi is not a ‘normal’ taxi ride. You 
don’t call Jon Barnes to take you where you want to 
go. The Ultimate Taxi is more of a musical show 
and adventure. It has been called the world’s 
smallest recording studio.

Make sure that you get your Ultimate Taxi ride while 
you are in Aspen, and join the ranks of Ivana, Kevin 
Costner, George Hamilton, Jerry Jeff Walker, Dudley 
Moore, the Beatles, Clint Eastwood, Jerry Seinfeld, 
and even Regis Philbin! Due to the popularity of the 
Ultimate Taxi, it is probably best to call in advance 
for a reservation. The Ultimate Taxi is in operation 
from 7pm to 10pm most nights.
