The amount of horsepower the V-Boost adds to the motorcycle is something other hot rod models just can’t offer. This feature also allows the V-Max to accelerate quickly and smoothly. 

The first V-Max in 1985 offered a 145 HP and V-Boost. It came with a V4 1200 CC engine. This model was only introduced in the United States. Yamaha releases a slower version in 1986 to Europe and France, offering a 104 HP. The Europe models did not feature the V-Boost. The design was slightly changed for 1990 including a digital electronic ignition. This was the first year the V-Max was offered in Japan. Changes had to be made to the European model as they were enforcing stricter noise restrictions.

In 1996 Yamaha decided to switch to a black exhaust system. It wasn’t as well received at they had hoped, so the design was switched back to chrome for the 1998 model.

The black and chrome color gives it a very muscular look. For some V-Max owners that has been the only drawback. There is no originality when it comes to the color of the motorcycle. However, many owners of the V-Max have enhanced theirs to make it unique. 

This has been done by adding a different exhaust system as well as pegs. Some have even added small decals to areas including cross bones or another graphic. Others choose to replace the factory mirrors with shorter, stockier versions. Other consumers complain that the seat isn’t comfortable for long rides, choosing to exchange it for a softer and wider customize seat that is.
