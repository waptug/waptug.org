Disneyland Purchases – Package Express

One of the nice guest service features at Disneyland 
is the Package Express service. This will allow you 
to make purchases, and not have to carry them 
around with you all day! Can you imagine trying to 
hold all of your packages, your kids, and ride the 
rides?

Instead, have your purchases sent to the Newsstand, 
which is located near the exit. This Package Express 
purchase allows you to pick your packages up as 
you are leaving the park. If you stay till closing, note 
that the pickup line will be very long. You should plan 
to leave at least an hour earlier than you had originally 
planned if you have packages to pick up.

You can also have your purchases sent directly to 
your hotel if you are staying at one of the Resort 
Hotels. This offers even more convenience, because 
you won’t have to leave the park earlier, or stand in 
the package pickup line. Another option is to rent a 
locker, and put all of your purchases in it until you 
are ready to leave. However, this means that you will 
have to walk back to the locker after each of your 
Disneyland purchases.
