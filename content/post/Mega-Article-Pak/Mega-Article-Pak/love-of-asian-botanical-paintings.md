Love of Asian Botanical Paintings

I have a love for Asian botanical paintings.  I’ve been seeking them out for a long time.  I have many in my collection and love each and every one of them.

The first Asian botanical painting that I bought was Vietnamese.  It was one of a series of twelve paintings that I bought that were created by Vu Viet Hung.  I have them all over my home.

These oil landscapes by Vu Viet Hung are stunning.  These Asian botanical paintings really set a serene tone in my home.  The subtleties of the colors and the simple themes go so well on my walls.

I found a lovely Asian botanical painting quite by chance at a yard sale.  I don’t usually make a habit of looking for paintings at yard sales, but this one was displayed out front and enticed me to stop.  At first glance, I thought I was looking at a painting of a palm tree.  At closer inspection, I found that the painting was of a bonsai tree.

My office has a more contemporary feel than the rest of my house.  I have found that I like to have an abstract Asian botanical painting to ponder while I am thinking.  I searched for a long time to find just the right piece to hang there.  I finally found a piece by an artist named Soniei called Enlightenment.

Soniei has a collection called the New Zen Sho Collection.  I love his work.  The abstract that I bought is considered an Asian botanical painting because it features bamboo.  In addition to the bamboo, there is beautiful calligraphy.

I have my eye on another Asian botanical painting by Soniei that has shades of sea-foam green.  It is much more subdued than the one I bought called Enlightenment.  This one is called Self-awareness and it is just lovely.  It is another painting of bamboo.

My mother-in-law admires the Asian botanical paintings that I find.  I found one that I really liked at a gallery in Hartford while I was on vacation.  It did not fit with my home and so I bought it for her.  She has really enjoyed it.  It features two flowering trees in acrylic on two panels.  The painting really is stunning with all of the shades of red.  It looks great in her house.

My husband isn’t as big a fan of Asian botanical paintings as I am.  They just don’t speak to him.  He has allowed me to hang one painting in his office because he approved of the color scheme.  The Asian botanical painting he chose for me to hang for him was a black and white.

Our daughter loves watercolor Asian botanical paintings on fabric.  She keeps her eye out for advertisements in our local paper for people selling them.  She has already purchased three.  She is well on her way to her own collection.

Bamboo is the most popular subject in Asian botanical paintings.  I have found so many paintings in so many different mediums that all feature bamboo.  I catch myself buying so many paintings that I’ve started giving them as gifts for friends and family for house warming gifts.

My sister recently bought a condo and I gave her an Asian botanical painting of happy birds and bamboo.  She liked the watercolor and asked me to find her two more to hang throughout her home.  I was able to find several more at the same shop that were created by the same artist.

The other Asian botanical paintings were of snow bamboo in moonlight and green bamboo.  I’ll keep checking back at that store for new paintings.  She said that she could probably use one or two more.

I am planning to redecorate my kitchen.  I do not like the French Country décor that the previous owner chose.  I would prefer that my kitchen reflect my personality better.  I will absolutely need an Asian botanical painting hung prominently in my kitchen.  

I have the perfect Asian botanical painting in mind already.  It is a nice Chinese painting that was done on rice paper with ink, water and color.  It is mounted with nice silk border by an expert and is ready to frame.
