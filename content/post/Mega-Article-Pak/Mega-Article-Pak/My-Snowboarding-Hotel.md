My Snowboarding Hotel

I always loved snowboarding for as long as I can remember. I love the way that snow boarding is a sport that is filled with excitement and personality. I also loved the way that snow boarding was seen as a kind of extreme sport. It made me feel almost proud of myself that I was associated with this status. When I firstly hit the slopes and tried snowboarding it was actually a very new sport at the time, and had not even nearly been in the Olympics.  

However, as the trend increased the slopes started to change its ratio of skiing to snowboarding. That is why I wanted to start a business that could benefit from this; I decided on starting a hotel in France that was actually targeting the snowboarders rather than the skiers. You see, the snow boarder and the skier are two very different kind of holiday maker. A snow boarder is more likely to be interested in having a great time, and socialising with younger people, whilst a skier may be away as part of a family vacation. 

However, I realised that my business was going to be a risky venture because at the same time as I started it, I was scared that snowboarding might not take off in the way that it has. I mean – did you know that know 22% of winter sports competitors are snowboarders? That is an amazing statistic and one that really indicates the kind of thing that I am talking about. Snow boarding is a massive sport, and I actually do not think there has been any other sport in the history of the world that has seen such success in such a short period of time. 

I should say the success of my hotel has been enormous, because I have been warm and comforting to the snowboarders, showing knowledge on the slopes and snowboarding in general. I  am able to tell them what I would do, and give them some hot tips that have been passed on to me from hundreds and hundreds of snow boarders through my hotel. 

One of the things that I love the most is the way that everyone is always having a good time, and that can reflect on my mood. When everyone in the hotel is enjoying themselves and having a good time, it is easier for me to sit back and have a good time as well. It really is that simple. 

I am always asked by the snowboarders if I go on the slopes myself, and I always have to say no, almost appearing like I am a kind of half-interested snowboarder. I almost feel my head dropping as I say it. However, the reason for this is that nowadays, I honestly very rarely have any spare time, and it is the sad part of having my own business. My wife always offers to cover, but when she does I always see it as a great opportunity to go down the bank, or do something like catch up with the paper work. 

When I think about how busy I am I always just stop and think about how lucky I am to have a successful business, and a comfortable living – however my passion for snowboarding that gave me the kick start to get the business underway has now gone.
