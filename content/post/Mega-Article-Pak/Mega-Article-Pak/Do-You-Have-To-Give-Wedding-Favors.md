Do You Have To Give Wedding Favors?

The question of whether or not you have to give wedding favors to your guests is a very common one. However, there is no easy answer to this question. While it is true that you technically are not required to give your guests any type of wedding favor at your wedding, it is also true that your guests will likely be expecting to receive a favor. This is what makes the matter more complicated. You may not be obligated to give out wedding favors but your guests may be offended if you decide not to do so. This article will take a look at the question of whether or not you have to give wedding favors to your guests and will provide some tips for giving out wedding favors on even the tightest budget.

As we discussed in the opening paragraph, wedding favors are in no way obligatory but that does not mean that guests still do not expect to receive a wedding favor when they attend a wedding. There are a couple of reasons for this. One of the most obvious reasons why guests expect to receive a wedding favor is that it is such a common practice that the majority of the weddings they have attended in the past have included a wedding favor. The other reason why guests expect to receive a wedding favor is that the purpose of a wedding favor is for the couple to express their gratitude to the guests for attending the wedding and reception. Although the couple will likely still send out thank you cards to all of the guests after the wedding, giving a small wedding favor is another way the couple can thank their guests for their support.

You may wonder why a couple would consider not giving wedding favors at their wedding. In most cases the simple answer to this question is that the couple is on a very tight budget and feels as though purchasing wedding favors for each of the guests will put them over budget. This is a very valid concern as it is important to remember that although wedding favors may be fairly inexpensive, this unit price must be multiplied by the number of guests in attendance. For example you may select a favor which costs only $2 per favor but you may be expecting 400 guests at your wedding. This means the costs of the favors alone will be $800 which may not even include the costs associated with shipping or wrapping the wedding favors. While we certainly understand the importance of budgets we believe the couple should incorporate a budget for wedding favors into their overall budget before the planning begins. This will help to ensure there is enough money available to give each guest a wedding favor as a token of gratitude.

When the couple is concerned about budget it is important to remember that wedding favors do not need to be expensive or extravagant. One simple way to make wedding favors more affordable is to give a wedding favor of a single flower to each guest. If you are already planning to have floral centerpieces you can discuss your options with your florist beforehand. You will likely be able to negotiate and affordable price for this favor because you are already purchasing your centerpieces from the florist. Selecting one flower used in the centerpiece and having your florist supply enough of these to give as favors is a really nice way to tie the centerpieces and the favors together. Alternately you might want to give each of your guests an artificial version of one of the flowers used in your centerpiece. These can be rather inexpensive and can also serve as a lasting reminder of your wedding.

Another way to keep wedding favors more affordable is to discuss your options with wedding favor distributors carefully. Many of them likely have closeout items available as well as discount items. Closeout items are items which have been discontinued but the distributor may have enough in stock for all of the guests at your wedding. Additionally, they may be willing to offer you a discount if you are purchasing a large number of favors.
