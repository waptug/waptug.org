Breast Feeding Adopted Babies

Not only is breast feeding an adopted baby easy,
the chances are that you will produce a large
amount of milk.  It isn't complicated to do, 
although it is different than breast feeding a
baby you have been pregnant with for 9 months.

Breast feeding and milk
There are two objectives that are involved in
breast feeding an adopted baby.  The first is
getting your baby to breast feed, and the other
is producing enough breast milk.  

There is more to breast feeding than just milk,
which is why many mothers are happy to feed 
without expecting to produce milk in the way
the baby needs.  It's the closeness and the
bond breast feeding provides that many mothers 
look for.

Taking the breast
Even though many feel the early introduction of
bottles may interfere with breast feeding, the
early introduction of artificial nipples can
interfere a great deal.  The sooner you can get
the baby to the breast after birth, the better 
things will be.

Babies will however, require the flow from the
breast in order to stay attached and continue
to suck, especially if they are used to getting
flow from a bottle or other method of feeding.

Producing breast milk
As soon as you have an adopted baby in sight,
contact a lactation clinic and start getting
your milk supply ready.  Keep in mind, you
may never produce a full milk supply for your
baby, although it may happen.  You should
never feel discouraged by what you may be
pumping before the baby, as a pump is never
quite as good at extracting milk as a baby
who is well latched and sucking.
