How to lease a new car? 

Whether you lease a car to get into the latest models or have better purchasing 
flexibility, getting a good deal is always bound to give you a lift. Use 
these guidelines to help you spot one:


Check incentives: be on the look-out for factory –subsidized lease deals. 
Car manufacturers realise that consumers who lease vehicles from them are 
more likely to be repeat customers than those who simply purchase vehicles. 
Through their leasing companies, they adjust the residual value and offer 
low financing charge. Other auto-manufacturers are also starting to give 
incentives on leasing, called leasing subventions. They offer these 
subsidies to put slow-selling models on the street, saving you even more 
money.

Set up a competitive: bidding environment to get the lowest price. If you 
already have an idea in mind of the make, model and trim level of your 
desired car, attempt to calculate your own lease payment before you go 
shopping to avoid paying through the roof. Check online comparison tools or 
use a lease calculator to check your lease payment based on purchase price. 
This gives you greater negotiation leverage as you solicit quotes from 
various leasing companies.

Make sure you know all the fees involved at the beginning of your lease: 
you may have to pay fees for licenses, registration and title. Other fees 
include acquisition fees, freight fees and local or state taxes. At 
lease-end, you may have to pay a disposition fee and charges for extra 
mileage and any excess wear. Be aware that some of these fees – like 
acquisition and disposition fees – are negotiable. 
Know your mileage needs: almost all leases limit the number of miles per 
year by imposing typically 10 to 20 cents per excess mile over 15,000 miles
a year. If you are the kind of high-commuter who puts 40,000 miles a year 
on his car, then you might end up running thousands of dollars in hefty 
penalties at the end of your lease. Be smart and negotiate a higher-mileage
limit or pad you excess miles at the beginning of your lease to avoid 
robber tax rates for excess miles. 
Almost all leases limit the number of miles per year by imposing fees

the kind of high-commuter who puts a lot miles on his car, then these costs
can add up quickly. Negotiate 

Include GAP coverage: make sure your lease includes GAP coverage. This 
covers you in the event of the vehicle getting wrecked, stolen or totalled. 
Without GAP insurance, you leave yourself wide open to thousands of dollars 
in leased obligations. Check if the GAP coverage is included so you don’t 
pay it twice.
