Diesel Passenger Vehicles

Both diesel cars and light trucks are receiving a 
lot of attention in the United States as a near
term strategy to achieve fuel economy and climate
change goals.  

The renewed interest in diesel as of late stems
from its potential to improve passenger vehicle
fuel economy.  The best diesel passenger vehicles
of today are more efficient on fuel than their
gas counterparts, helping to reduce carbon 
emissions by 30 percent or more.

There are some auto makers that are talking about
re-introducing diesel into light duty markets as
a solution for reducing global warming pollution
from both cars and trucks.  Another important
reason is that the higher efficiency of diesels
will provide a quick fix for manufacturers who
are struggling to meet federal fuel economy 
standards for light trucks.

Even if the efficiency benefits of diesel do
yield real world improvements on the economy, the
potential climate change benefits are modest.

Even though diesel achieves more miles per gallon
than gasoline, many are concerned about the
impact that diesel passenger vehicles have on
the economy.  From time to time, the combustion
in the engine can cause black emissions to spit
from the exhaust, which is actually very bad
for the economy.

While gas is actually the worst, diesel is taking
strides to improve engines and the impact on
the economy.  Diesel is getting more and more
popular these days, as gas prices continue to
rise and rise.

Although diesel engines can have an impact on 
the economy, they are the way to go for those
looking to conserve mileage.  Diesel vehicles
cost more than gas vehicles, although they will
offer you more than you can expect.  If you are
looking for a quality ride, diesel is the way
to go.
