Gas Permeable Contact Lenses

Also known as oxygen permeable contacts, gas permeable contact lenses are a lot easier to take care of then other types of contacts - including soft contact lenses.  GP (Gas Permeable) contacts are made from a combination of fluorine and silicone, meaning that they won’t attract protein near as much as other types of contacts.  If you have had a problem with protein on your lenses in the past, GP contacts will pretty much eliminate that problem.

Keep in mind, you’ll still need to clean your GP lenses, in order to keep them free of protein, debris, and to keep them comfortable when you wear them.  They clean much easier and faster than soft lenses, and they will last you longer as well. For a lot of contact lenses users, gas permeable lenses are the preferred way to go.

If you wear GP lenses or looking to wear them, you’ll need to keep a re-wetting solution or saline drops with you just in case they start to get dry.  Anytime your eyes feel dry, you can use the drops to moisten your eyes back up, and keep your contacts comfortable.  Re-wetting drops are normal to use, even with soft lenses.  Dryness in the eyes is very common with contacts, which is why you should always have re-wetting drops with you.

After you have worn your GP lenses during the day, you should always clean, rinse, and dry them out once you take them out for the night.  When you clean them, you should always use the right solution, instead of water. If you soak them in water it could damage the material, which could in turn damage your eyes.  Depending on the type of contacts and brand you have, you should pick the solution accordingly.  The solution you use shouldn’t burn your eyes, or cause you to feel any type of discomfort.

When you go to your optician to have your eyes fitted for contacts, be sure to ask about gas permeable contacts. If your eye doctor thinks they are right for you, he should recommend them.  Normally, they are for older people, or those who have had eye problems in the past.  They are strong contacts - and perfect for daily wear. 

If you’ve been looking for contact lenses that won’t disappoint, GP lenses are everything you need.  They can be purchased locally or online, normally at the same price of soft lenses.  They last longer than soft lenses, meaning that you won’t need to purchase them quite as often.  If you take care of them, they should last you for a long time.  Once you have tried gas permeable contact lenses and see just how great they are - you’ll never look at soft contact lenses the same way again.
