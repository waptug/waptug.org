The Disneyland Hotel


For the ultimate Disneyland vacation, you should 
definitely stay at the Disneyland Resort Hotel. With 
990 rooms in three high rise towers, this is the 
original Disney Hotel, located in Downtown Disney. 
If you want to truly experience all that Disneyland 
has to offer, you must stay at the Disneyland Resort 
Hotel.

The guest rooms in the Disneyland Hotel are 
astounding. Offering standard rooms and suites, 
each room has either a king size bed or two queen 
size beds, room service, phones with voicemail, irons, 
ironing boards, refrigerators, hairdryers, make up 
mirrors, and safes. Cribs and roll away beds are 
available, as well as smoking and non-smoking rooms. 
The rooms are even sprinkled with Pixie Dust! For 
families, the suites are highly recommended. Suites 
contain one, two, or three bedrooms, and have all 
of the amenities of a standard room as well. 

The Concierge service at the Disneyland Hotel 
cannot be topped. Concierge service entitles you to 
priority check-in, admission to an exclusive lounge, 
a continental breakfast, an evening wine and cheese 
reception. Nightly turn-down service is included, as 
well as DVD players and complimentary movies. 
You will also have an unlimited supply of bottled 
water and soft drinks. The Concierge serves to 
make your vacation as enjoyable and trouble-free 
as possible.

Disney touches are everywhere, and this is the 
closest you can actually come to living in Never Land. 
The swimming pool even has a Never Land theme, 
and there are several cove pools and a sandy beach. 
The hotel also features a children’s playground, a 
volleyball court, and Koi fish ponds. The recreational 
area encompasses a 5000 square foot area inspired 
by Peter Pan. There are many scenic waterfalls, 
tropical foliage, and mysterious caves on the property. 
There is even a Team Mickey work out room full of 
state-of-the-art gym equipment. 

At the Disneyland Hotel, you will feel like your 
Disney experience has truly already started as soon 
as you walk in the door. This is where the famous 
Goofy’s Kitchen is located, as well as The Captain’s 
Galley, The Coffee House, Crocs Bits ‘n’ Bites, 
Granville’s Steak House, Hook’s Pointe, The Wine 
Cellar, and The Lost Bar. 

When you stay at the Disneyland Hotel, your 
vacation continues even after a day of sight seeing 
and attractions in the park. In fact, your Disneyland 
vacation begins each and every morning when you 
wake up in the Magic Kingdom that the Disneyland 
Hotel represents.
