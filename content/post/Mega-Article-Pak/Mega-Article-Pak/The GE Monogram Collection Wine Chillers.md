The GE Monogram Collection: Wine Chillers

When it comes to serving beverages to complement your exotic dinner cuisine, nothing beats a well aged fine wine. Wines come in a variety of flavors and types, such as a sweet wine that's perfect for dinner, or a bottle of champagne to ring in the New Year. Your taste buds are in for a treat with a relaxing sip of wine.

If you really like collecting and serving wine for those social gatherings, you might be in the market for a wine chiller. What better way to chill and serve wine to guests than an appliance specifically engineered for that purpose? Of course, you'll want a machine that matches the sophisticated nature that wine possesses. In that case, a wine chiller from the General Electric Monogram Collection would be your best bet.

With GE being in the household appliance game for a long time, one can be certain of purchasing a high quality product. GE machines are manufactured for reliability and long life. The special GE Monogram appliances add to that quality with its sleek and classy look that's fit for any household. You can even customize these appliances to further meet your decorative needs.

A GE Monogram wine chiller will definitely add to your home. Not only will you be able to cool and chill your wine bottles to perfection, but you'll also amaze your cohorts at your next dinner party. A sleek transparent glass door lets you peer into the interior of your wine chiller. The cherry wood shelves will match any nearby cabinet or other wooden structure. Interior lighting will automatically illuminate the appliance when the door is opened.

The shelves come unfinished, but you can choose to have the wood finished. Or if you don't like the appearance of the shelves, the door can be customized. A special glass is available so that you can change the glass between a transparent and opaque setting. This enables you to quickly conceal or reveal the contents of your wine chiller.

There is plenty of space to store your wine bottles in a GE Monogram wine chiller. Seven shelves provide more than enough room to chill your drinks. If you require a little more area for those larger wine bottles, one shelf can be sacrificed to accommodate the margin that you need.

To allow easy use and control over the temperature, the GE Monogram wine chiller has simple temperature control. This lets you set the ideal temperature for the desired task, whether it's for aging the wine or serving it. The controls can be either a digital panel or a conventional knob. Both controls sport an LED display that lets you monitor the current temperature with a quick gaze.

GE Monogram wine chillers are a safe bet for your wine storage needs. Not only will a wine chiller preserve your collection, but you also have a great asset to your aesthetic quality. If any old wine chiller simply won't do, consider looking into the Monogram Collection. You will definitely find something that parallels your taste.
