Sunny Miami Florida is without a doubt one of the hottest real estate markets in the world.  Over the years, Miami has noticed a lot of changes in it’s real estate market.  Miami Florida has always been known for it’s pristine beaches and activities, making it perfect for a vacation home or a permanent home for anyone wanting to live close to one of the best cities in the world.

During the beginning of the year 2000, Florida noticed some high rises in real estate.  In most areas, including Sunny Isle Beach, the prices of real estate went up as much as 250% in some areas.  This was a drastic change in price, making real estate in Florida very hard to afford.

This change in price let the world know that Florida was very sought after for real estate.  Although the prices were very high, this also changed the entire economic structure throughout Florida, resulting in more businesses, work opportunities, and a lot more income.

Homes and housing units will always be built here, although real estate agents have found it increasingly difficult to sell homes.  Even though some homes will sell a lot faster than others, there are some homes that remain on the market for months and months at a time.
