ATV for Beginners 

Since their introduction to the public several decades ago, ATVs have become increasingly popular. They are very appealing to riders because of the amount of the excitement one feels as they are riding. People are now discovering that the whole family can enjoy the excitement of the ATV. On the negative side, though, more people are injured while riding ATVs than in any other recreational outdoor sport. If you are beginning to pursue an interest in ATVs, there are a number of things to know. 

The first step is to head for the trails with someone who has experience with an ATV. Actually ride an ATV so that you can decide if you are really interested in getting one. Once you are certain that you like it, go pick out your vehicle. As of this second, it's not a law but it is recommended that people of certain sizes use ATVs of certain sizes. For example, if you have a son and he weighs 85 pounds, do not try to find an 800 or 900 cc machine for you to stick him on. Try putting him on a 440 or 600 cc machine. This is more in line with something he can handle. Also, make sure that you are fitted to the right machine.  

It is usually not recommended that beginners buy brand new machines. As you end up becoming more familiar with the sport, you will talk with people who have different models, and you may end up finding yourself in constant pursuit of the "next best thing." After you have your first machine, definitely take a safety course. Courses are usually broken up into three or four weeks, with them lasting two and a half hours a night once a week. Consider these to be well worth your time and your money. Some courses even end with the instructor taking the class out on to trails. Courses are not mandatory - but they will most likely be one day! 

Next, you should take the time necessary to sit down at night and read your owner's manual. Keep in mind that each ATV is different, so if there are labels or parts you don't know, the only real answers you will ever find will be in the manuals. Oh yeah...when you go out on the trail, make sure that you carry the owner's manual with you. If you have bought a used machine from a neighbor or someone else, you can get a copy of the owner's manual by taking the serial number off the machine and going to a dealer.  

The next thing that you are going to want to do is to get out on to a trail and practice. That really is the only way that you are going to learn how to drive an ATV. Of course, you will always want to make sure that you have permission from whoever owns the land! In the beginning, be sure that you do what you must to ensure that you are riding sensibly. Ride with experienced people. As with other sports, you only get better by riding with people who are better than you. So ride with people who have a fair amount of experience. In addition, no matter how confident you are, when beginning, make sure that you always ride under the supervision of someone who can guide you. In other words, never, ever ride alone! 

If you follow these simple steps, you will be able to enjoy all of the fun and the excitement that makes up driving an ATV. As with other things, it will take some time before you, as a beginner, are able to do it by yourself. Take the time to receive training on how to do it, and dive headlong into the owner’s manual. Once you feel ready to hit the trails, practice driving your ATV. Remember to have an experienced driver with you. Following these steps will ensure your safety and will guarantee that you have a good time.
