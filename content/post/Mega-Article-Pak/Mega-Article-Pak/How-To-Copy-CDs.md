How To Copy CDs

Copying CDs is something that is very popular now more
than ever.  When CD burners and duplication was first
introduced, people caught on although it wasn't nearly
as popular as it is today.  These days, millions of 
people throughout the world copy audio, data, and 
even video to CDs.

To make a copy of a CD, you'll need a master to copy,
a blank disk, a CD-RW drive, and the proper software.
Most newer computers include either a CD-RW or DVD-RW
drive.  If your computer is older, you'll need to go 
out and buy the drive, which doesn't cost much money
and is very easy to install.

If you have a DVD-RW drive, you'll be able to copy
both CDs and DVDs.  The rate of copying will vary,
with 4X being the slowest and up to 48X being the
fastest.  If your drive supports 48X, you can duplicate
a CD in a matter of minutes.

Once you have the CD-RW or DVD-RW drive and some 
blank CD-R media, all you need is the software to 
duplicate.  Nero is among the most popular, as well
as Sonic Record Now and Easy CD Creator.  There are
many different types out there, from those that cost
money to the freeware software that doesn't cost 
anything to use.

Once you have everything you need, simply run the 
software and create your disk.  You can copy many 
types of media, including pictures, video, audio,
and even data from your computer.  Depending on what 
you want to copy, all need to do is select it from the 
software menu and let it rip.

CD duplication is a lot of fun and easy for everyone
to learn as well.  You can back up a lot of things,
or just save pictures of your special memories - the
choices are entirely up to you.
