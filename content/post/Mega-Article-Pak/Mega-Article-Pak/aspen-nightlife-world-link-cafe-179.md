Aspen Nightlife – World Link Café

While on your wonderful vacation in Aspen, you will 
enjoy many of the finer things in life – including fresh 
open air and natural surroundings. It is wonderful 
and peaceful – but since we have become a 
technical society, you might start having email 
withdrawals. The World Link Café in Aspen has a 
solution.

This wonderful Internet Café is located in the heart 
of downtown Aspen on Hyman Avenue. It is open 
until 10pm each day, and serves wonderful 
cappuccinos, mochas, and lattes, as well as 
pastries, cookies, sausage rolls and meat pies. The 
Internet is also served with a bank of computers with 
Internet Access – where you can access your email.

Of course, there are fees for using the computers, 
and it isn’t cheap. It costs about $10 per hour – but 
if you are having Internet or email withdrawals, it may 
be well worth it to spend twenty bucks or so for a 
couple of hours of computer time. Then, get right back 
out there and enjoy more of the fresh air and peace 
that Aspen has to offer you.
