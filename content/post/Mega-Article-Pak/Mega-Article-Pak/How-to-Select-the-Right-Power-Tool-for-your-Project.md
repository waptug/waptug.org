How to Select the Right Power Tool for your Project

To get the best results with any project, it is essential that you choose the right power tool. There are so many to choose from that it can be difficult. There are many things to consider for each type of power tool. Most of us have a particular brand name we are loyal to. Price, quality, and warranty are also factors that heavily influence a power tool purchase. 

It may surprise you, but 29% of power tools are purchased by women. It is likely some of those power tools are for their own personal use and the others are to give as gifts for family members, friends, co-workers, and significant others. When in doubt as to what to get a man, go for a power tool. Make sure it is something he wants and will use though! 

While you may be using the right saw for the project, are you using the right blade? This is going to make a difference in the type of cut you end up with. Rip blades cut with the grain of the materials. It has deep teeth along parts of the blade to help remove the material as it cuts. You will get a fast cut, but not necessarily a clean one. A crosscut blade has teeth on both sides of the blade. As it glides across the material, it alternates sides that it cuts with. This is going to give you a very nice cut. 

There are combination blades available, and they are commonly used instead of switching between a rip blade and a crosscut blade. The fewer teeth, the more rugged the cut it going to be. Combination blades with many teeth will give you the cleanest cut. There are specialty blades available as well. Refer to the manual that came with your power tool to find out if a specialty blade is recommended. 

The right power tool combined with the right accessory is going to make any type of project go smoother as well as affect the quality of the outcome. In many cases you have the option of several tools that may get the job done, but take the time to find out which one is going to work best. Weigh the pros and cons of each one. It is also going to depend on what hand tools you already have. Buying a new one makes sense if it is going to help you accomplish projects, but probably not worth the expensive if you only plan to use it once or twice. 

Hand size and strength is very important whey you are selecting the right power tools. Many people don’t take that into consideration. Try the models on display in the store. If the tool feels heavy, imagine how much more so it is going to get when you have been operating it for several minutes? 

Some of the smaller hand tools are designed to get into very small spaces, but if you have large hands it may not work well for you. Don’t forget the population that is left handed. Most power tools can be used by either a right hander or a left hander. Others such as saws can be difficult because of how the guide and the blade are set up. 

The owner’s guide that comes with any power tool will give you great pointers on what projects it is to be used for. If you have a particular project in mind, searching through all of those manuals can be time consuming. Try using the internet to look up the project you are going to do and you should find information on the best power tools to use for the job. You will likely find some very helpful hints for the project as well. The perfect combination is using a power tool you know how to operate, fits well in your hands, and is designed for the project you are working on.
