Building With Windows In Mind

There is a lot to think about when designing a home,
as many people simply overlook window treatments.  In
this article, I'm hoping to help you avoid the common
pitfalls involved and help you save some money.

When using decorative casing such as shutters and 2
inch plantation size wooden blinds, you should always
make sure that you have at least 2 1/2".  When you 
have a double or triple window encased within one
window opening, you may want to use a vertical trim
strips between each window.  Make sure that you include
this when measuring the depth.  Even though it is less
common decorating sliding doors, make sure that you
include the handle when you measure, as the usual
depth for this is 4 inches.

There are several different styles of window treatments,
such as circular, arced, eyebrow arched, or even
angles.  All of them are beautiful and appealing,
although very restricted when it comes to choices,
especially when you are working with eyebrow and 1/4
arches.

When you are dealing with French doors there are a
few things to keep in mind.  The doors will normally
swing open into the home, which could cause problems
with the valance you use.  Consider using a valance
mounted to the door or allowing the doors to swing
outward.  When you are considering shades, blinds,
or shuters, don't forget to consider the handles and
locks.

Make sure that when you are considering window 
treatments that you remember window placement as
well.  There are many restrictions when you have
chair rails or base boards going around the opening
of the window.  There could also be a problem with
the placement of the drapery as well.

The drapery may not stack back sufficiently or the
outside edge may not extend to the outside of the
window. Things can go much easier if you have the
same amount of space on each side of the window, so
you should try to center the window whenever you 
can.

When you place the window, make sure that you leave
enough space between the top of the window and the
ceiling.  There should be at least 2 inches for
bracket placement.  When installing a wood header,
make sure that it extends to the ceiling and that
the heavier treatments are mounted in the wood.  If
you aren't using wood headers but instead mounting
into sheetrock you should use molly or toggle 
bolts for the best possible protection.

There are other things you need to consider when
it comes to windows.  First, you'll need to make
sure that all windows are accessible even those in
an unfinished attic.  This will help make things
easier for future decorating or expansion of the
room.  Also, make sure that the windows in the
room are the same style.
