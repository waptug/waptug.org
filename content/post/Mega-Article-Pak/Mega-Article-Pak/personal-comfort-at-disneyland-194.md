Personal Comfort at Disneyland

There is no better way to ruin your Disneyland 
vacation than trying to walk around with blisters on
your feet! It is vitally important that you wear 
comfortable shoes that are already broken in. You 
will be doing more walking than you normally would 
when you visit Disneyland. 

It is also important that you bring a change of 
clothing. You can rent a locker at Disneyland to 
store your extra clothes. You can rub your thighs 
raw if you ride water rides in denim shorts, then try 
to walk around while you dry out! Enjoy the water 
rides – but then go change into dry clothing! Bring 
extra shoes as well. Walking around in wet shoes 
is not only uncomfortable; it can also contribute to 
blisters. 

More than blisters can cause discomfort. Some 
people simply are not used to being on their feet all 
day. If your feet are tired and sore at the end of the 
day, soak them in cool water with Epsom salt. This 
will offer more relief than soaking them in hot or 
warm water. After a good twenty minute soak, your 
feet will feel refreshed and ready for more walking!
