Personal Loan Officers

Most lending institutions offer personal loans. There are personal loan officers that will assist you with the process as well as let you know your options. It is not uncommon for loan officers to be trained in more than one type of loan. If possible, look for a lender that has personal loan officers that specifically deal with that type of loan only. That will ensure they have the latest information available in that area and know exactly what your options are when a personal loan is in the works.

Being a personal loan office involves being able to work well with the public. It also requires excellent processing and organization skills. The job won’t always be easy as there will be many loans you have to deny. I am sure telling that to the applicant is never an easy part of the job. Personal loan offices have to be well trained in the field of such loans as well as willing to keep up with the information that emerges in that field. 

Excellent communication skills are absolutely required as you will need to find ways to translate the technical business side of the loan process into simple common language terms for applicants to comprehend. Since personal loan officers have access to applicant’s personal information, confidentiality is very important. 

Personal loan officers are often in a line of work similar to that of a salesman. They often talk with those interested in personal loans on the phone or in personal. They work hard to establish good report early on. They also encourage the applicant to proceed with the application. Personal loan officers are often instructed by the lender they work for to tell the applicant the maximum amount of personal loan they are eligible for rather than just the amount they requested. This is to encourage the applicant to accept more money, thus generating more revenue for the lending institution in the form of interest. 

Once a loan application has been submitted, the personal loan officer will review the information. They will also verify employment and other pertinent information. If there is additional information needed to finish processing the application, the loan officer will notify the applicant. After all that is in place, it doesn’t take long to access the applicant’s credit score and determine if they are eligible. The personal loan officer will analyze the credit information and the application to determine the amount of risk associated with approving the loan. Once this is done, the entire application and information is passed on to an underwriter. Here the final say on approval is decided as is the amount that the applicant is eligible to borrow.

Personal loan officers generally work 40 hours per week and have weekends off. However, more and more lending companies are starting to offer services on Saturdays to meet the needs of the customers. Overtime many be required of the job if there is a high volume of applications to process. Often volume will increase when rates drop. That will depend on the policies of the lender you work the personal loan officer works for. 

Most loan officers are required to have at least a bachelor’s degree in an area of business such as finance or economics. The specific education and work experience needed will depend on the institution. There are no licensing requirements to be a personal loan officer. In some companies, individuals who have worked hard but don’t have a formal education will be trained on the job to be a personal loan officer. The pay for personal loan officers varies by agency and region. However, it is likely to be at least double the minimum wage for that area. This field is in high demand, with over 300,000 loan officers in the Nation.

This can also include assistance with completing the loan application. Most personal loan officers have an educational background in business that they can use to build a solid foundation as a personal loan officer on.
