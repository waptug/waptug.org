Christmas Shopping for Distant Relatives

It may be really simple to Christmas shop for close relatives who you see often and know very well. However, when it comes to shopping for relatives who you rarely see because they live far away, it can be significantly more difficult. There are a number of factors which contribute to the difficulty of this situation. First of all it is difficult because if you don’t see the relatives often you may not have a good idea of their current interests or hobbies which would simplify the shopping process. It is also difficult to Christmas shop for distant relatives because you have to consider the cause and complexity of shipping the items to the relatives. This article will offer a few ideas for dealing with Christmas shopping for distant relatives to make this complex situation more manageable. 

An unfortunate reality is many people live quite far away from many of their relatives. Relatives may live thousands of miles away but they are still people you love and care about and Christmas is an excellent time to express your love for them by sending them a Christmas gift which tells them you are thinking of them. However, despite your best intentions, it is often difficult to Christmas shop for a distant relative. This is because you may not keep in close contact with the relative and may not know their current hobbies or interests. You may not even know their current clothing sizes. They may have lost or gained weight since the last time you saw them so even purchasing clothing can be difficult. Furthermore they may have preferred wearing a particular color the last time you spent some time with them but may have a new favorite color now. For all these reasons, Christmas shopping for a distant relative may be difficult but there are ways to simplify the process. 

One way to make it easier to Christmas shop for a distant relative is to call them to catch up before you do your shopping. Just giving them a quick phone call can provide you with a great deal of insight into their life. It is a good idea to make a call like this anyway just to keep in touch but it can also help you out a great deal with your Christmas shopping. You might learn a great deal during this phone conversation such as activities in which your relative is involved or leisure activities they enjoy. All of this information can make it easier for you to select an appropriate Christmas gift. You might also consider asking your relative what they want for Christmas. This may take away the element of surprise but it will ensure you are purchasing something your relative really wants. Another option to consider is purchasing a gift certificate. This may not be the most exciting gift but it is one that is sure to be appreciated. 

Another complication which stems from Christmas shopping for distant relatives is the matter of shipping the gifts. This can be difficult and expensive. Also it can be a tremendous hassle especially if you are shipping the gift close to Christmas time when the lines in the post office are historically long. One way to avoid some of these complications is to purchase gifts which are relatively small in size. This will help you to avoid excessive charges associated with shipping items which are oversized or heavy. Additionally, if you are planning a trip to visit your relatives during Christmas, you could consider purchasing items which are small enough to fit in your suitcase so you can transport the items yourself. This will not only save you the cost of shipping your Christmas gifts but will also save you the hassle of dealing with standing in long lines to ship the gifts. Gift certificates were previously mentioned as an excellent option for distant relatives if you are not sure what type of gift they will appreciate most but they are also perfect for shipping.
