James Stewart:  A Well Known Championship Supercross Rider

Are you a fan of supercross motorcycle racing?  If so, there is a chance that you have heard of Ricky Carmichael and Jeremy McGrath.  What about James Stewart?  If you were paying attention to the 2006 supercross motorcycle racing season, there is a good chance that you have.  In 2006, James Stewart was crowned the 2006 World Supercross GP Champion. This alone is enough to be proud of, but when you look more closely at all that Stewart has accomplished, you will find that he did not make it to where he is today just by luck; it took a large amount of hard work and determination.

James Stewart was born in Florida in 1985; this is one of the reasons why his success is so unique. Although many supercross motorcycle riders get their start at a young age, James Stewart is still relatively young for what he has accomplished. Perhaps, part of that credit can be given to this father.  James Stewart Sr. was also a motocross racer.  It has been said that he regularly took his son along with him to the racers.  It has also been said that this is where James Stewart developed a love for the sport and that love never died down.

Like many other professional supercross racers, James Stewart got his start in motocross racing.  He traveled the country, racing at numerous outdoor venues, otherwise known as motocross racing tracks. This practice and experience is what has helped Stewart become the success that he is today.  With getting started in supercross racing at such a young age, it is important to take note of his family and all that they helped him achieve.  It has been noted that James Stewart’s family made numerous sacrifices to allow him achieve his dream of becoming a professional supercross rider, a dream that would later come true.  

As previously mentioned, Stewart’s age is enough to make his journey remarkable, but so is something else; his ethnicity.  Although it shouldn’t be focused on, James Stewart is African American.  Why his race is important to note is because he was the first ever African American to win a Supercross World Series Event.  In fact, James Stewart is often referred to as the “Tiger Woods of Supercross.”  This nickname recently replaced his old childhood nickname of “Bubba.”

In addition to winning the THQ World Super Series, in 2005, James Stewart is also well known for his recent supercross championship win in 2006, as mentioned above.  This win is important, as well as many of the others.  During his career, which will still continue, James Stewart has competed with some of the greatest and well known supercross racers. These racers include, but are not limited to Chad Reed, Jeremy McGrath, and Ricky Carmichael.  His performance, when competing against these well known and established riders, goes to show that he has more than earned the right to be known as a supercross champ.
