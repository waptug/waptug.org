Using Online Video Websites to Promote Your Business

Are you a small business owner?  If so, how is your business doing?  Despite businesses that are a success, there are many business owners who want more.  If you are one of those individuals, it is likely that you would do just about anything in your power to improve your business, especially if you sell a particular product or service. When working to improve their businesses, many business owners spend thousands, if not millions, of dollars on advertising.  How would you feel if you learned that there was a free way that you could promote your business?

A free way to promote your business?  Unfortunately, many business owners believe that there is no such thing.  If by chance it is believed, there are many who would automatically assume that it was a wasted effort. Although many free advertising methods can be deemed time consuming and not worth the effort, there is one that you should try. That method involves the internet and free online video websites.  

If you are an avid internet user, there is a good chance that you are fully aware of what free online video websites are and what they do.  If not, you will want to learn.  Free online video websites are websites that allow internet users to watch videos that are hosted on their website, free of charge. What is nice about free online video websites is that most will also allow internet users, just like you, to make, upload, and share their own videos.  Depending on the type of business you own and operate, you may be able to use these websites to your advantage.  

When it comes to using free online video websites to your advantage, you will want to familiarize yourself with the websites that are currently available. You can easily do this by performing a standard internet search.  Your search should produce a fairly large number of results, including Google Video and YouTube.  Before making your video, you will want to examine any of the rules and restrictions that are set in place.  When doing so, you will find that most video websites do not have any rules or restrictions concerning the use of online videos to promote your business; however, you will still want to make sure that your video is tactfully done.  

If you are an online business owner, especially one that sells a particular product, you could make a video showcasing your product.  For instance, if your specialty is photo blankets, you may want to show your samples or even go over the process of making them. It may also be a good idea to mention the overall cost of photo blankets and who should own them.  If your product would make a great gift, it is also advised that you mentioned that. When doing your video, you will want to refrain from making your video seem like spam. Although you may want to mention the price, you will want to refrain from promoting your business too much. At the end of your video, you may want to offer directions on how to make a purchase or learn more information.

Although products are the easiest to showcase in an online video, you can also use your video to help promote a particular service that you sell. For instance, if you offer assistance to those that are indebt, you will want to provide an overview of what debt is, who it hurts, and how help can be obtained. Providing general information on debt is a great way to keep your video from appearing too pushy.  As mentioned above, you may also want to include information on your business at the end of your video.  This may help to increase the number of clients you receive, especially if you provide a service that is used and needed by many.

To make you video, whether or not you plan on using that video to promote your business, you will need a few pieces of equipment.  Perhaps, the most important is a recording device.  For the best results, you are urged to use a camcorder, but you can also you a webcam.  Movie making software is important, as well.  Most computers already come equipped with movie making software. After you have made and saved your video, you will have to follow the instructions of the free online video website you wish to use.
