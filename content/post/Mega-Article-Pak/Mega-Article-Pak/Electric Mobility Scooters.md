Electric Mobility Scooters Present A Viable Solution To Physical Challenges

Electric mobility scooters can provide the elderly, disabled, and seriously ill freedom of movement. Mobility is a critical to just about every aspect of everyday living. Having some freedom of movement enhances a person's capability to learn, earn a living and interact with friends, family and community. A large percentage of people with mobility limitations have permanent disabilities. Many people suffer from conditions that make walking an extremely difficult and painful task including arthritis, muscular dystrophy and multiple sclerosis. These individuals benefit from a variety of mobility aids and devices to assist them in lead fulfilling and active lives. The most popular forms of independently operated mobility equipment are electric mobility scooters and motorized wheelchairs.

A motorized wheelchair is a form of personal transportation that typically has six wheels and is steered using a "joystick" type control mechanism. Other names for the motorized wheelchair include, electric chair, power wheelchair and power chair. A motorized wheelchair is usually equipped with outstanding maneuverability features that make them perfect for use in the home and will generally fit just about anywhere. Motorized wheelchairs are typically for in-door use.

The power mobility provided by electric wheelchairs has made a dramatic difference in many people's lives. The development of new technology in the industry has made it possible for people to obtain smaller, more lightweight and maneuverable motorized wheelchairs for use inside the home allowing people to move about in small places and complete their activities of daily living without being bed-ridden or sent to nursing homes. 

In comparison, electric mobility scooters have either three or four wheels and steer much like a bicycle, using a set of handlebars and hand operated control mechanisms. Electric mobility scooters are ideal for indoor and outdoor activities, as they glide smoothly and easily over a variety of surfaces. There are even portable electric mobility scooters that will fit easily in the trunk of a car. 
Electric mobility scooters are reliable, easy to operate, comfortable, safe and do not have the more obvious medical appearance of a motorized wheelchair. 

Today’s electric mobility scooters have three or four wheels, a steering column-known as a tiller-with handlebars and hand operated control mechanisms and a platform that supports the seat, battery and the riders feet.  Electric mobility scooters are much less physically strenuous than a walker or manual wheelchair. Although the rider of a mobility scooter must be physically able to walk a few steps and have adequate upper body strength and dexterity, they do not require the more substantial amount of strength and dexterity necessary to operate a walker or manual wheelchair. The swiveling captain’s style seat of an electric mobility scooter is typically easier than moving the foot supports of a manual or motorized wheelchair. In addition, Electric mobility scooters are simple to maintain and easily recharged using a standard electrical outlet and charger.

Physical impairments need not prevent someone from participating in daily activities as well as special occasions with family and friends. Electric mobility scooters restore independence and freedom of mobility to help promote an active lifestyle.
