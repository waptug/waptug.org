Benefits Of Breast Feeding

Once you've given birth, breast feeding is the single
most important thing you can do to protect your baby
and help to promote good health.  Best of all, breast
feeding is free.

Along with saving you money on HMR (Human Milk 
Replacement), breast feeding can also help you to 
keep your medical bills down.  Babies that are fed
with formula get sicker more often and more seriously
than babies that are breast fed  They also have more
ear infections, respiratory infections, and other
problems.  

This can be even more true if your family has had a
history of allergies.  When a baby is breast fed, the
antibodies pass on from the mother to the baby, 
helping to protect against illness and allergies.  As
the baby's system matures, his body will begin to 
make it's own antibodies, and he'll be more equipped
to handle sensitivities of food.

Sucking on the breast will also help with the 
development or jaw alignment and the development of
the cheekbone.  For this very reason, there is less
of the need for costly orthodontic work when the 
child gets older.

Unlike formula, breast milk is always ready, always
available, convenient, and always the right temperature
for feeding.  Plus, it contains all of the vitamins
and minerals your growing baby needs, saving you a  
lot of money.  

Breast feeding also offers many benefits for the mom
as well.  The baby sucking at the breast will cause
contractions right after birth, leading to less 
bleeding for the mom, and helping her uterus to it's
shape before pregnancy much faster.  

Breast feeding will also burn calories, so a mom can
lose weight much faster than if she fed her baby with
a bottle.  Breast feeding will also create a special
bond with the mother and the baby - which is one
thing formula simpy cannot do.
