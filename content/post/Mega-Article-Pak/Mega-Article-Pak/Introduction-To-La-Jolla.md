Introduction To La Jolla

La Jolla California, is a seaside resort community of
around 25,000.  Spanish for "the jewel", it's often
times referred to as "jewel by the sea".  La Jolla
borders the Pacific Ocean to the south and extends
north to Torrey Pines State Reserve and Del Mar,
California.

Along the way, La Jolla encompasses neighborhoods
like Bird Rock, Windansea, La Jolla Shores, La Jolla
Farms, Torrey Pines, Mount Soledad, and even La Jolla
Village.  

Residents of La Jolla and business owners refer to
the "village" or "town" of La Jolla.  The official
postal address for the zip code 92037 is actually La
Jolla, and not San Diego as it is for most 
communities within the City of San Diego.  Sometimes,
tourists get confused and believe that La Jolla is
actually a seperate city, which it isn't.

La Jolla is a community of the City of San Diego.
La Jolla has several community groups that work to 
unify the voice of the area, including several non
profit organizations.

With it's palm lined streets, large homes, and 
tropical climate and atmosphere, La Jolla is like
a southern European village with it's own touch of
Beverly Hills along the retail shops on Prospect
Street.  A lot of the natural charm from La Jolla
stems from the presence of the ocean and Mount
Soledad.

Several narrow curvy roads follow the contours of
Soledad with hundreds of nice homes overlooking the
ocean, nestled gently on the slopes.  There are
several sandy beaches here as well, including the
Windansea Beach, La Jolla Cove, La Jolla Beach,
and La Jolla Shores.

La Jolla also has the Torrey Pines Golf Course,
which was made famous by the PGA Tour Buick
Invitational held there each February.  Down the
steep cliffs frm the golf course is the famous
Black's Beach.

The downtown area of La Jolla is well known for
it's jewelry stores, upmarket restaurants, and
even hotels.  Prospect Street and Girad Avenue
also offer several famous boutiques.  Well known
for its architectural and historical presence  is
the La Valencia Hotel, which used to welcome movie
stars on retreat from Hollywood.

Recently, harbor seals have taken over the Children's
Beach, which is a quiet man made cove near the 
downtown area.  The seals are protected under 
federal law, so removing them is nearly impossible.
Now, the beach is open, as the rope is down.  
Swimming here is allowed, although it's not 
recommended.
