Getting To La Jolla

La Jolla, located in California, is a 20 minute 
drive from downtown San Diego by going Interstate
5 north.  Take the exit at Ardath Road, eventually
Ardath Road will become Torrey Pines Road.  Continue
west on this road, and you'll reach the village 
when you see Prospect Place.  Turn right on Prospect
Place and you'll enter the heart of La Jolla.

On average, around 7,000 people will visit La Jolla
every day.  With so many people coming to such a 
small place, you can almost bet that finding a 
parking place is a chore.  There isn't any parking
meters, although many of the streets closest to the
water do have one hour time limits.  You can go
a little farther out for two hour parking, although
you'll have to observe the time limits.  Even in
off season, parking enforcement is really enforced
here.

Even during the off season, finding a parking place
is very hard to do.  The streets are almost always
crowded, although for good reason.  La Jolla is an
excellent tourist attraction, with plenty of water
and fun for the entire family.

If you pay close attention when you visit, you can
find a few paid lots that are scattered around the
town.  If you get closer to the downtown area, the
lots will be a little bit cheaper.

Your best bet when visiting La Jolla might be a 
parking lot that's well hidden - so few people will
notice it.  If you turn downhill on Coast Blvd
from Prospect, you'll find it on the left, right
across from the Cave Store.  Keep in mind though,
vehicles over 6'5" won't fit through.
