Introduction To Mini Blinds

The mechanisms that are used to open and close blinds
range from simple cords and easy to use chains to
remote controlled electronic devices.  Mini blinds
will block out sunlight, prevent people from
looking into your house, and also add style to
your home.  Mini blinds come in various styles 
and you can even make them yourself at home.

Mini blinds are available in a wide range of
sizes and colors, along with custom sizes and
styles.  This allows you to control the direction
and amount of natural light while still 
providing a sense of insulation.  There are some
blinds styles that even adjust to allow breezes
to flow from the window into the room by raising
or tilting the slats.

With one style, slats are sandwiched between
two sheer fabric layers that diffuse light when
the slats are open.  With another style, the
slats are laminated vertically to a single
fabric layer for a curtain effect.  

Mini blinds can come in wood, faux wood, vinyl,
and even aluminum.  Wood type blinds offer
rich, subtle colors along with unique textures.
The classic types of blinds look elegantly
simple and can help to enhance a contemporary
look or even add a classic flair to your home.

A less expensive alternative to wooden mini
blinds is faux wood, or a synthetic wood 
made of PVC or a composite material.  Aluminum
is a good choice as well, as it provides a 
low cost and durable solution to your window
problems.  Aluminum mini blinds are also 
easy to clean and easy to maintain.  The 
least expensive variety is vinyl blinds, 
that come in standard sizes only.
