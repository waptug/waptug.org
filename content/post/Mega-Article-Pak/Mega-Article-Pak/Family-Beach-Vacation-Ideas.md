Family Beach Vacation Ideas

All across the world, there are several locations you
can choose for your family beach vacation.  Below,
you will find many different locations, and what
they will offer you and your family.

Maui
Throughout the West Coast of Maui, you'll have many
choices for your beach vacation.  If you plan to
enjoy golf, the Kapalua Resort is a great choice,
as guests will receive 30% lower golf rates than
those who don't stay at the resort.  The resort
also includes the Kapalua Bay Hotel, Kapalua Villas,
and the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua.

One bay over from the Kapalua Bay is the Napili Kai
Beach Resort, which is a low rise family resort 
that offers comfortable beach front condos.  The
Napili Kai also offers complimentary programs for
children ages 6 - 12 from mid June to the end of
August, during Easter and Christmas.  The condos are
seconds away from the beach, and they include 
kitchens as well as laundry facilities.

If you prefer a more secluded area, the Maui Prince
hotel is located in a quiet setting surrounded by
two scenic golf courses and a large sandy beach 
that kids never seem to get enough of.

Mololai family adventures
The island of Molokai is filled with empty beaches,
no traffic lights, and few tourists.  Many tourists
visits only for a day or so, with some going to
the island because they assumed they were going to
Molokini (which is a snorkeling site near Maui).

The island of Mololai is accessible by ferry from
Maui or by plane from Honolulu.  The island is 
ideal for those who like the outdoors with a twist
of adventure.  When you visit here, you shouldn't
expect shopping or nightlife.

Florida
The Breakers Hotel in sunny Palm Beach Florida has
a spa, golf course, and a 1/2 mile sandy beach.  
There is also a seperate pool for the kids, a family
entertainment center, and a kid's program.  Families
can reserve up to five adjoining rooms while 
children under the age of 16 can stay for free in
the same room as their parents.

If you decide to take your beach vacation in Orlando,
the Loews Hard Rock Hotel offers you plenty of 
beach and amusement rides, with a 240 foot slide
and a white sandy beach.

California
With several family beach vacation resorts in
California, the Hotel Del Coronado is among the most
famous.  The hotel offers many different facilities
for families, including lessons in kayaking, surfing,
tennis, and biking.

Georgia
The barrier islands in Georgia offer ambiance,
sandy beaches, and a laid back prospective to life
as you know it.  Jekyll Island offers you miles
of paved bike path with three 18 hole golf courses,
which is perfect for golf enthusiasts.
