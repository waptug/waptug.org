Marilyn Monroe: Short Bio

To call Marilyn Monroe as an actress is a great injustice done to the great acting legend. In fact she was the authority in acting and if we go on writing about her a library of books wouldn't be enough to describe her. Such was her influence on films and fashion during her era that she is remembered even today as the goddess of fashion and powerhouse of acting. Even today's teenagers look at her as the role model. Marilyn Monroe was a class in her own and created an identity that would never vanish. Though she would have been in her 80's now but she is still remains dream girl of every man and every man compares the beauty of the woman with the beauty of Marilyn Monroe. 

Marilyn Monroe was born on June 1, 1926 in Los Angeles, California. Her original name was Norma Jean Mortensen but for the millions of her fans she was "The Blonde Bombshell". This famous star had a very trouble childhood. Her mother was a film cutter at RKO, a widow and so insane that she abandoned her to foster home. Marilyn Monroe's misery didn't end there; she had a close brush with death at the age of 2 and was nearly raped at the age of 6. At the age of 9 she started doing kitchen work for church for a nickel a month. She used to work in an aircraft plant at the age of 16. She married a man who she used to call Daddy. She started modeling when he went into the military. But the marriage was short lived, as they got divorced in 1946. She amassed two hundred books of many great writers. She had a love for music and listened to Beethoven's music in particular. Also at the same time she joined acting classes at Hollywood's Actor's Lab. She also took literature classes at University of California, Los Angeles. 

While the actress had a relatively easy modeling career it was not the case with her acting career. She had to be content with many small roles and she starred in dozen B movies with secondary roles. She got a break with Twentieth Century Fox, which ended within a year. She then signed a contract with Columbia Pictures, which was also for only six months. She starred in a small role in "The Asphalt Jungle" in 1950 and also in "All about Eve". Her performance interested the Studio and they went on to sign a 7-year contract with her. It was in the year 1953 that her career skyrocketed to new heights when she starred as a sex symbol in "Niagara" and "Gentleman prefer Blondes". She again starred in a super hit movie "The Seven Year Itch" in 1955, the year which also saw her getting married to one of the greatest baseball player Joe DiMaggio. Monroe wanted to change her sex bomb image and wanted to try something serious. She wanted to have a change over; she thus consulted director Lee Strasberg and took some sessions of psychoanalysis. She did look a transformed person in her nee movie in 1956 called "Bus Stop" which also won her critical acclaim. She also married playwright Arthur Miller the same year to everyone's surprise. 

While her professional life was soaring her personal life was taking its toll on her. After two miscarriages and a gynecological surgery she fell prey to alcohol and pills. She had an affair with Yves Montand during the same time. She was not able to complete the movie "The Misfits" which was written by her departing husband Arthur Miller due to frequent exhaustions, the movie also happened to be Clark Gable's last one when he died after a year due to heart attack. She was again dropped from the movie "Something's Got to Give" due to frequent no shows and drug abuse.  

Marilyn Monroe's life came to a tragic end on August 5, 1962 due to drug overdose at a young age of 36. Though Marilyn Monroe did only thirty movies in her life but her memorable movies would be remembered forever.
