The GE Monogram Wine Chiller ZDWC240NBS

The GE Monogram wine chiller ZDWC240NBS is an interesting appliance to add to your household, to say the least. Its basic function is to preserve and chill your wine bottles. As such, this would be a helpful item to wine collectors and connoisseurs.

Of course, any conventional wine chiller could do this job. You wouldn't have to pay an arm and a leg for it either. With that in mind, what distinguishes the GE Monogram wine chiller from other kinds of wine chillers? Although regular wine chillers can accomplish this task, so can your refrigerator. The GE Monogram ZDWC240NBS doesn't just offer simple functionality. It brings much more to the table.

Being a part of the GE Monogram collection, the ZDWC240NBS wine chiller blends together practicality and looks. The Monogram line of appliances was carefully constructed to create products that are dependable and pleasing to the eye. The outer shell is made with sleek and shiny stainless steel. The shelves are made with unfinished cherry wood to give it a unique look.

The GE Monogram wine chiller ZDWC240NBS can be further customized to fit your needs. Taking a look at the shelves, you can get the wood finished. This can help your appliance match with any surrounding wooden structures such as a cabinet. 

The glass door of the unit can also be exchanged with something different. There is an option to something called privacy glass. This innovative liquid-crystal technology lets you conceal and reveal the contents of your wine chiller with a press of a button.

As you open the glass door, a fashionable light will illuminate the interior. It creates a pleasant atmosphere as you store or empty the wine chiller. If the feature annoys you, the light can be handled with a switch inside the unit.

When you start using the ZDWC240NBS wine chiller, you may notice that your wine bottles won't fit. If you try to force the bottles inside, you will end up with scuffed and torn labels. What you will want to do is remove the shelves to make more room for your larger bottles. You can do so by pressing down on the plastic tabs on each side of the shelf.

The controls allow you to manipulate the temperature settings with ease. You can set the proper conditions to age your wine or prepare it to be served. A digital readout will let you know the precise climate that your wine bottles are being stored in. The controls come in two types: a standard knob or a digital panel.

If you want a stylish and sensible appliance to add to your home, the GE Monogram wine chiller is something you don't want to pass on. With its customizable parts and spiffy look, this wine chiller gets the job done and then some. 
Perhaps the only downside is the hefty price tag; the lowest base price averages to $1000. However, the expensive price is worth it when you know you're getting another quality product from GE.
