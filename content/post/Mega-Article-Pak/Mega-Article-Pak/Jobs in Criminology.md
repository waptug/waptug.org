Exploring the Many Available Jobs in Criminology

With a criminology degree, there are a number of career paths available for the individual.  Individuals that have just graduated are likely to get involved in these particular careers.  These are some of the more flexible career fields when it comes to individuals who are educated by whom may not have the experience that some other employment offices may desire.  In addition, these jobs are interesting and allow the individual to learn and explore aspects that they were not able to while in school.  The hands on experience will help the graduate in many ways later on in their careers as well as at the time of their employment.  One of these exciting careers is in the field of crime intelligence analysis.  This is a very interesting field for individuals that are looking to have experience when it comes to deciphering the foundation of crimes.

Some other creative careers when it comes to criminology employment opportunities would go on to include consumer advocates, who work with laws and regulations that would either benefit or protect the average consumer from the manufacturers or corporations, environment protection analysts, who help to formulate different regulations when it comes to the environment and the protection that it can receive from the public and community members at large, and a regional crime prevention coordinator, who would be in charge of coming up with different methods in which to protect the residents in a region of the state.  This is a position that would also help to come up with ways in which the community crime prevention members would be organized and structured in order to provide a more effective and efficient crime task force within the region.  As a result, this career is very important when it comes to preventing crime within the region by understanding some of the underlying pressures and structures of the criminal element within the society or culture.

One of the most obvious career opportunities that exists for individuals that graduate with a criminology degree would be that of those who go on to become police officers.  This can extend into other fields of the police department including detectives and criminal psychologists on the payroll of the police department.  In this area, many people are able to come together in order to look at how society and crime interacts on an intimate level.

The crimes that take place are not looked at and analyzed in order to come up with ways to prevent the crime in the area, rather the police force is able to catch the criminals and hopefully take them out of the society in which they were raised or committing the crimes.  In some cases, the police officers are able to work and interact with the regional crime coordinator, in order to create a more solidified union of crime prevention within the region, city or town.  There are some other cases in which the police officers will interact with community correction officers, either because they are employed in jails where the criminals are required to serve their time or as parole or probation officers who are able to readjust the criminal to the society in which they live or to make sure that they are not violating any rules or restrictions that have been placed on them.
