You can signup for affiliate programs or other programs like Google Adsense.  If you are using your blog to make money then you will defiantly want to promote it.  

When it comes to promoting blogs, there are many blog owners who decide to let the search engine do the work for them.  Search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN use special techniques that reads the content on your website. That content is then used to rank your website with particular keywords.
