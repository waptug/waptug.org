eBay Sellers:  How to Deal with Difficult Customers

If you are an eBay seller, you will have to do business with eBay buyers.  As traditional retailers do, you may also have a problem with some customers. While the majority of eBay buyers are more than pleasant to deal with, there are some who can “ruffle your feathers.”  While your first thought may be to give a difficult eBay buyer a piece of your mind, you may want to refrain from doing so, especially if you rely on eBay to generate income for yourself and your family.

When it comes to dealing with difficult eBay buyers, one problem that commonly arises is with your current auction listings.  It is not uncommon to get an eBay message from a buyer requesting that you lower your price on one of your listed items.  In fact, it is not uncommon for an eBay buyer to mention that other eBay sellers have the same items listed for less.  If and when this ever happens to you, you will want to keep your cool. You should simply state that you are unable to lower your asking price.  Kindly suggest to the eBay buyer in question that if they are looking for more affordable prices, they should consider doing business with an eBay seller who offers more affordable merchandise.  The decision as to whether or not you want to lower your eBay prices is yours to make, but you should never feel pressured into doing so.

Another situation that commonly arises on eBay, concerning difficult eBay buyers, is the payment process. There are many eBay buyers who make the mistake of assuming that all eBay sellers accept the same methods of payments, but not all do.  One of the most common methods of payment accepted is PayPal.  If you currently do not have a PayPal account, you may want to look into doing so.  Regardless of what methods of payments you do accept, you are urged to outline them in your auction listings.  Yes, eBay has a section for that, but, unfortunately, not all sellers make their way down to that section.  Should you have a buyer that wants to make alternative arrangements, you need to use your best judgment.  If you cannot reach an agreement, eBay should be notified.

One of the other common problems that arise on eBay, with difficult eBay buyers, is those who refuse to pay.  With eBay, if you bid on an auction and win it, you are responsible for making payment; however, that doesn’t mean that everyone does.  When trying to request payment from a non-paying eBay buyer, you will want to stay professional when doing so. By simply sending a few reminder notices you should still be able to keep your positive image.  If you haven’t heard anything from your non-paying eBay buyer, you may want to contact eBay after about a week.  eBay has a process that allows you to get your fees back, as well as a process that will gives non-paying eBay buyers a negative feedback rating.

It is also not uncommon for an eBay buyer to be unhappy with the item that they purchased and received from you.  If this happens, you need to also use your best judgment.  To prevent a problem from occurring, you will want to make sure that you provide a detailed description of whatever you are selling, as well as numerous pictures.  It is also advised that you outline a return policy, whether or not you actually have one.  Should you have intentionally or unintentionally mislead an eBay buyer, you should make the situation right; however, stand your ground if you are being scammed or “taken for a ride.”

The above mentioned situations are just a few of the many that you may come across as an eBay seller.  No matter what situation arises, you are advised to use your best judgment and also keep your cool. In the end, you will be glad that you did.
