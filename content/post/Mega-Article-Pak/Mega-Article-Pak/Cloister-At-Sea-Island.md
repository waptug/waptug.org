Cloister At Sea Island

The Cloister At Sea Island is a private five mile
long coastal vacation spot in Georgia.  Sea Island
is well known for its championship golf course, 
which after recent improvements, is now better than
ever before.

There are a total of 54 holes, which include the
18 hole Plantation Course which opened in 1998, and
was designed by Rees Jones.  The 18 hole Seaside
Course was renovated by Tom Fazio and re-opened
again in 1999.  You can learn to play golf at this
course, or just play and polish your game.

The Sea Island resort also offers a spa with several
fitness facilities.  You can participate in special
classes as well as personalized fitness and wellness
programs.  Other activities around the resort include
tennis, horseback riding, sunset cruises, boating,
fishing, shooting school, kayaking, swimming, and
even diving lessons.

Sea Island also offers a family destination where
kids can choose from several different vacation
activities.  Children can play afternoon tennis free
of charge and even participate in complimentary
golf and tennis clinics.  During the summer, spring
break and even holidays, the resort is happy to
provide a program for kids ages 3 - 11.

Resort rooms and food
The Cloister at Sea Island offers you well over 250
guest rooms and suites that are situated in various
houses on Sea Island.  The Retreat House, Hamilton
House, and Harrington House are all located on the
beach, while the newer guest houses and Terrace
Houses are all located between the beach and the
tennis center.

Guests that visit Sea Island can also stay at the
Lodge at Sea Island Golf Club, which opened in 
March of 2001.  The Lodge offers guests 40 luxurious
rooms and suites that are situated above the 
clubhouse with golf course and even ocean views.

The main dining room at the Cloister offers live
music and dancing during warmer months. The Terrace
dining room, located at the Lodge at Sea Island
Golf Club serves continental cuisine with a 
Southern twist.  

Late spring, summer, and early fall are by far
the best times to check out the Cloister at Sea
Island.  Sea Island is an hour drive by car from
Savannah Georgia and one hour away from Jacksonville
Florida.  Private aircraft can also land at the
McKinnon Airport on St. Simons Island, which is 
four miles away from the Cloister.  No matter how
you get here - you'll be glad you did!
