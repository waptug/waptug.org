Natural Toothache Remedies

Not many people are aware of the fact that several herbs can be used in the relief of toothache pain.  Natural herbs such as cloves, calendula, tarragon, and yarrow can be used to help relieve th pain until you can get to the dentist.  For many years, different cultures have counted on herbs to help get the pain of a toothache control and get temporary relief.

Native Americans for example, used the inner bark found in the butternut tree to their gums to get relief from toothaches.  The butternut tree is found in North America, and is also the cousin of the black walnut tree.  Butternut trees are found along rivers in well drained soil, rich woods, and even in back yards.  Once the tree matures, it can reach heights of up to 60 feet, with the bark being light grey in color, and the leaves and the fruit resembling the black walnut tree.  The bark of the tree can be applied to the gums, helping to alleviate toothache pain.  

Yarrow on the other hand, can be found in Asia, Europe, and North America.  It normally grows wild in meadows, fields, and in open wood lands.  The root of yarrow, is what contains the anaesthetic effect.  If you apply the fresh root of yarrow to your tooth or gums, it will help to stop the pain - until you can get an appointment with the dentist and get it taken care of.

The herb known as clove is an evergreen tree, native to tropical areas.  These days however, it can be found throughout the world.  As many already know, the dried flower bud of clove is what contains the medicine.  The oil from clove, when used on a toothache, will help to stop the pain almost immediately.  If you compare cloves to other natural toothache remedies, you’ll find clove to be the best.

For many years, natural herbs have been used to stop toothache pain.  Hundreds of years ago, herbs were the only way to stop the pain.  Dentists were just starting to come around, although they didn’t have near the equipment and sophistication that they have these days.  Even though teeth were pulled during these times, it normally happened with alcohol to numb the pain then pliers to remove the tooth.

Throughout the course of time, herbs have proven to be very effective with stopping toothache pain.  If you are interested in herbs or have any questions about them, you shouldn’t hesitate to ask your dentist his opinion.  Dentists know herbs, and should be able to recommend natural remedies to you if you request them.  The next time you experience the pain of a toothache - you should always remember that herbs are a great way to relieve the pain.
