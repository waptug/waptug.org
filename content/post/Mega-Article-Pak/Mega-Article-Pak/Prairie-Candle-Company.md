Prairie Candle Company

The Prairie Candle Company has been a family owned business in operation for ten years. Located in the rural community of Springfield, Colorado, these jar candles are known in the area for being pretty, colorful, wonderful smelling, and long lasting. Prairie Candle Company takes pride in offering customers the best quality candle products. They use only top of the line wax and supplies for optimum results.

Prairie Candle Company was developed out of a person’s love for candles. However, they were disappointed that most candles lost their smell quickly or they didn’t burn evenly. Since they enjoyed candles so much, research was conducted to develop a product that doesn’t smoke, it burns evenly, and it burns to the bottom of the jar. This is what we know as the Prairie candle today. 

The classic collection of Prairie candles come in 5 sizes and 36 fragrances. Choose from 4.5 ounces, 10 ounces, 10.5 ounces, 16 ounces, or 26 ounces. The fragrances include some classics such as cinnamon and vanilla. There are some very original scents as well including cucumber melon and orange sherbet. Each Prairie candle in the classic collection comes with a glass lid. The colors of the candles are very pretty.

The all natural soy collection comes in 4 sizes and 24 great fragrances. These candles come in a glass jar with a wooden top. Choose from a small, medium, large, or extra large sugar pot. Flavors like cinnabun and cinnamon cider will make your mouth water. 

For the cowboy types out there, you will simply enjoy the red neck collection. These candles come in tin cans that look similar to cans of shoe polish. These six ounce tins are available in 16 fragrances with names like Grizzly Breath which is cinnamon and Possum Porridge which is spring fever. You will have fun with these great candle names and the silly picture on each one.

Cup and pail candles by the Prairie candle company are very unique looking. There are seven fragrances to choose from including cherry vanilla. The cup and pail are white in color and very rustic looking. These are great for gift giving or home decorating.
