Swimming Pool Safety

With any type of swimming pool, whether it’s above ground or below ground, you’ll need to make sure that safety is enforced.  Swimming pool safety is essential with children especially, along with those who can’t swim.  With accidental drowning rates on the rise, you should always make sure that you know a lot about safety - to protect those who swim at your pool.

The most important area of safety with a swimming pool is to make sure that children can’t get into the pool if you aren’t around.  The easiest way to do this is to put a fence around your swimming pool, and make sure that the gate is locked at all times.  Little kids may be drawn to the water, and they can easily fall in and drowned if they aren’t watched. Hundreds of little kids die in the United States alone by drowning, simply because they had access to a swimming pool.  Most of these deaths could have easily been avoided if the swimming pool owner used a fence around his pool.

When you open your pool up for the summer, you should also make sure that you have plenty of safety equipment nearby.  If you have little kids of your own that you know can’t swim, you should always keep them within an arm’s length of you.  If you are going to be taking them into the water, you should use a waist belt or safety jacket with them, to ensure that they stay afloat.  Those of you who have an in ground pool probably have a kiddie area where the water isn’t deep.  This is perfect for teaching little kids to swim, as they can stay in this area until they get comfortable in the water.

Anytime your swimming pool is open, you should make sure that there is always someone around who can swim.  If you let friends use the pool that you know can’t swim, there is always the risk of accidental drowning.  Even though it may not be the intention, it can easily happen in just a few seconds.  Swimming is a lot of fun and great exercise, although it can be very deadly if someone gets in the water that can’t swim.

If you have an above ground swimming pool, you won’t need to have a fence around the pool, unless you want a privacy fence.  Above ground pools require a ladder or deck, which makes it hard for little kids to get into.  On the other hand, some kids who can climb up the ladder may not know how to swim.  If you have kids in your house or kids who use your pool that you know can’t swim, you should always make sure that they understand not to go near the pool unless you are around.

If you enforce swimming pool safety in your home, it will go a long way.  Everyone loves to swim and enjoy the water, especially on hot days.  A swimming pool can provide a lot of fun for the entire family, although you should make safety your first concern.  You can never get too much safety, especially in the event of saving lives.  Before you let someone use your swimming pool, you should make sure that they understand the safety aspects of swimming.  Never allow alcohol around your pool either, as it can easily affect someone’s ability to swim.  If you enforce safety and make sure that those who use your pool have safety in mind - you’ll go a long way in protecting those you love from serious injury or accidental drowning.
