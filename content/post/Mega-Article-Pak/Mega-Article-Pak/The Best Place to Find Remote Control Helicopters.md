The Best Place to Find Remote Control Helicopters

Where is the best place to find remote control helicopters?  I can tell you for sure that you’ll first want to look in an electronics store, such as Radio Shack, Best Buy, or Circuit City.  There you could find remote control helicopters for a pretty reasonable price and you will probably get durable model.  My recommendation for finding remote control helicopters would be to first go to your preferred company’s online site and look through the models they have for sale.

Since you probably won’t be able to use the helicopters in the actual store, it’s sometimes better to just read about them online and then order them through the company.  Yes, you may need to pay a bit extra for shipping, but I think it’s worth it.  Then when you receive the remote control helicopter, you can immediately take it out to your back yard and see how it performs.

Save the box in case it ends up not being as durable as the company promised it would be.  You should always make sure you get a warranty for your remote control helicopter because you might end up needing to send it back in exchange for a different one.  I would suggest getting one with welded sides or even a continuous plastic sheath so you don’t have to worry about it cracking or rusting.  Whatever you do, make sure you research it well and buy your helicopter from a reputable company, because you certainly don’t want to have to return it soon after you purchase it.  Your best bet would probably be Radio Shack if you want to get a good deal, but you could also try the Discovery Store or even Brookstone if you’re looking for a model that will really impress people.

You need to think about your motivation ahead of time: would you rather a model that looks flashy in the air, or one that doesn’t break if you end up crashing it into the ground?  These are things you need to consider before you make a purchase, because you might have to compromise quality for beauty or vice versa.  My recommendation is to get a remote control helicopter that can withstand the test of time and crashes, because just choosing the one that looks best to you isn’t really the best way to go about it.  If it’s pretty and you crash it, the remote control helicopter will quickly become ugly, and you should not have to deal with that.

In either case, a remote control helicopter is a great idea for fun on a bright sunny weekend, and as long as you do your research and know what you’re looking for ahead of time, you’ll be sure to get the remote control helicopter that best suits you and you can really get years of enjoyment out of it.  And if it so happens that the first one you choose turns out to be poor quality and you have to purchase another one in a short time, just know that you learned how durable they need to be, and next time you purchase a remote control helicopter, you can be a more informed consumer.
