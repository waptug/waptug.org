Dyson D15

Unlike the use of wheels that most vacuums have, the
Dyson DC15 upright vacuum has a large yellow ball
that will allow the vacuum to pivot and roll with
the greatest of ease.  With the DC15, you simply
turn your wrist and the entire vacuum cleaner will
change direction.  The ability to maneuver this 
easily is something that is commonly associated with
canister style vacuum cleaners.

In addition to the unique yet innovative ball design,
the Dyson DC15 also offers quite an interesting 
filtration system.  No matter what you may think
or hear, Dyson vacuums don't use filters in the
way that most vacuum cleaners do.

With the Dyson DC15, the air and dirt are sucked
into the container where the outer cyclone removes
large particles such as food, hair, and even 
fibers.  The air will then move into the shroud
and inner cyclone where it is rotated with a higher
velocity to drop fine particles of dust out of
the air.

From the inner cyclone, the air will move about
through a washable inner foam pre filter where
a majority of the particles will remain trapped.
This feature helps the DC15 to keep dirt and debris
trapped inside and out of the motor.

The last step in the system after moving through
the motor is the trip through the final HEPA
filter.  The DC15 has a very strict filter system,
which will prevent 99.9% of bacteria and mold
from getting to your home.  The vacuum will suck
it up and keep it inside of the vacuum where it
belongs.

Even though they aren't very well known, Dyson
has been around for many years.  They aren't as
popular or as well known as the bigger companies
such as Hoover, although they offer you great
quality and performance with their vacuum
cleaners.  Unlike Hoover, Dyson works to improve
on their own products as well as the competition
with each product they release.

The Dyson DC15 is truly a great vacuum to hit 
the market, as it is the first and only vacuum
cleaner to feature the very unique ball.  Even
though robotic vacuum cleaners are becoming the
most popular types of vacuum cleaners, the DC15
is ideal for housewives who want a traditional
vacuum cleaner with a twist.

The Dyson DC15 is also known for its suction 
power and attachments as well.  With the ball
assembly, using attachments are a breeze.  The
only problem you may have, is getting the hang 
of things.  

The attachment wand is stored inside of the 
handle of the vacuum and is always attached.
To use it, you lock the handle in the upright
position then push a button on the front of
the handle that will allow you to telescope 
the wand for use.
