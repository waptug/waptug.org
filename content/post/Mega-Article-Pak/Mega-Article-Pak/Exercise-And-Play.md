Exercise And Play

Often times, when children return from playing, they
look quite exhausted and ready for a nap.  This is
the most accurate description, and also quite the
truth, as playing is hard work.  It's exhausting to
the mind and body of the child, and it plays an
important role in helping them to become productive
and healthy.

The role of play and exercise in the life of a young
child will provide them with several benefits.  
Exercise of the body is a very important part of
keeping the young body fit as it grows into an adult
body.  Once we reach adulthood, if we've had the 
benefit of exercise and play, we all tend to 
continue that habit well into our adult years.

Play is also good in the form of participating in
organized sports, coordinated play times, and being
a member of a large group during all of these types
of activities.  Playing on this level will teach
us how to interact with peers and perform as a 
team with our fellow players.  In today's business
world, these skills are essential.  

What we learn in body language, coping skills, and
the interaction of the mind and body during our
interaction with others is invaluable.  When we
learn this skills to the fullest, not only will 
we learn how to get along with others, but we will
also learn how to interact better with ourselves.

Although interacting with ourselves seems like
a rather pointless exercise, it is actually an
important part of maintaining the best sense of
health and wellness.  There will always be times
when our bodies are trying to tell us things
about our physical or mental condition, which we
will simply refuse to listen to.

Through exercise and play, we will also learn
what our limitations are - both physical and
mental.  At times of play, you'll see children
and young adults push themselves to their limit
and beyond.  As children, we are all more able
to distinguish between a real limit versus what
society itself calls our limits.

For children and young adults, the pressures of
the world don't affect them near as much as it 
does adults.  Children have a much better state of
mind and peace, unlike adults that have let the 
outside influence the body and mind, which will
do little more than becoming a dominant factor of
time.

As you can tell, the benefits that are gained from
exercise and play time as children, will benefit
us for the rest of our lives.  As adults, we all
too often forget how important both exercise and
play are.  

Normally, we want to rush children into their 
daily responsibilities, forgetting that at their
age they need play and interaction for their young
minds.
