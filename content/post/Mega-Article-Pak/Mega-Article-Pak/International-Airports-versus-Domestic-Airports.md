International Airports versus Domestic Airports

Each year, a large number of Americans fly for the first time. As exciting as it is to be a first-time flyer, many first-time flyers are at a disadvantage. That disadvantage is not knowing everything about the airport that they will be using or the airline that they will be flying on. If you are a first-time flyer, you are advised against going into this exciting experience with unanswered questions.  Instead, you are advised to get the answers to your questions.

When it comes to first-time air travel, there are an unlimited number of questions that many have. Some want to know what the best international airports are to fly out of and others want to know exactly what an intentional airport is.  If you are planning of flying out of the country, it is advised that you familiarize yourself, not only with local international airports, but international airports as a whole. You will likely find that after doing so you will not only know what you are doing, but you will also have a better appreciation for international travel.

In the United States, there are two main types of airports. These airports are domestic airports and international airports.  Perhaps, the best way to learn more about international airports, namely what they are, is to compare them to domestic airports. Domestic airports are more commonly found in the United States, when compared to international airports.  This is because essentially any airport is considered a domestic airport.  

A domestic airport is defined as an airport, in the United States, that offers flights to and from other cities or states, also in the United States. Since their planes will not be leaving American soil, the flights are considered domestic flights.  Essentially, an airport that houses domestic flight is referred to as a domestic airport. On the other hand, there is an intentional airport.  

An international airport is an airport that offers flights from the United States to other countries.  Although they tend to advertise the fact that they specialize in international flights, most international airports not only have international flights, but domestic flights as well. For that reason, international airports are often larger in size, when compared to most domestic airports.  

The size of an airport will also have a direct impact on how you will go about getting around the airport.  Since most, but not all, domestic airports are relatively small in size, many only have a few terminals. These terminals are also likely to be connected or be all in the same building.  International airports are a different story, in fact, some international airports are so large they have to shuttle their passengers around from terminal to terminal. 

Although there are a number of differences between international airports and domestic airports, there are some similarities between the two. These similarities most commonly include the baggage and passenger screening processes.  Due to concerns about airport security, namely on international flights, the airline industry has started to follow a number of strict rules. These rules often include bans on dangerous objects and intense screening, such as the removal of all shoes.  In most international airports, domestics flights are not always separated from international flights, this means that all passengers will have to go through the same security checkpoints and examinations.  

As you can see, it is easy to learn about international airports, especially when comparing them to domestic airports.  Now that you know exactly what an international airport is and does, you can now start searching for an international airport that can offer you the services that you need, if you haven’t already done so.
