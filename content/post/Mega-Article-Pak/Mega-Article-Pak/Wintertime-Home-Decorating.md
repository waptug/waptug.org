Wintertime Home Decorating

Most people begin the home decorating process for winter with a bang only to end with a whimper. Far too few people realize that Christmas is only the beginning of the winter season and that while Christmas decorations are a nice addition, they are also a temporary decorative addition in most homes lasting little more than a month if that long. This leaves two more months of winter with a sparsely decorated home in many cases.

There are many things that are associated with winter however far too many of these things have been swept under the category of Christmas décor and their values as simple hallmarks of winter have been forgotten or relegated to the mere distinction of yet another Christmas decoration. Winter months for some are long and cold. Anything that brings a feeling of warmth and cheer into the home is for the most part an excellent idea as a winter home decoration.

Believe it or not, hibernating animals for many brings about a feeling of winter. Try using black bears as a home decorating theme to make your home feel a little more cozy and better prepared for the cold nights of wintertime. Flannel is a great companion to these delightful black bears and can be used in throws, bedding, and curtains in order to complete the look with style and finesse. In fact, you might want to throw in a few flannel pillows so that you can attempt to hibernate right alongside the cuddly black bears. These are quite popular home decorations as of late so you should have no problem finding a bear or two unless you happen to be in my neighborhood because I've probably snapped them all up already.

Fireplaces. There isn't enough that can be said about the ability of a nice roaring fire to add warmth and a wintertime glow to almost any room. It really isn't winter for most people unless there is a nice fire burning in the grate. The warmth is so much more than merely physical it is also soul soothing and comforting to watch a fire burning brightly before your eyes while warming your cold hands and feet. These nifty devices can also add a touch of romance to your winter nights so be sure to keep cozy blankets and candles close by as well.

Speaking of candles. Much like a fireplace candles add a warm cheerfulness to the rooms they touch. There are certain fragrances that are perfect for wintertime candle burning but even less appropriate fragrances are often welcome during winter months as they provide the soft glow that makes the world seem so much smaller and friendlier in the process. Keep this in mind as you are shopping for your winter home decorating ideas as well as the fact that fragrances matter when creating an atmosphere so choose the fragrances appropriately to the season.

Use pillows and blankets in your winter decorating to add layers of warmth and comfort as well as visual appeal. It is amazing the things that the mind can do in the winter but one of the more amazing things it does is convince you that you are warm when you are surrounded by warmth. With blankets and pillows lining your sofas and chairs however, if your mind doesn't convince you there is always the option of just bundling up and letting your body convince your mind. There is also something soothing about the comfort and close softness of the pillows and blankets whether one is in perfect health or really feeling the chill of winter down to their bones. 

Don't let the celebration of winter end when the Christmas tree comes down. Find ways to incorporate warmth into your home decorating style that only winter can accommodate. Embrace the season with affection and laughter and all that enter your home will be warmed by the charming atmosphere inside.
