Finances:  The Importance of Staying on the Same Page with Your Family

Are you a married or do you currently reside with your romantic partner?  If you do, there is a good chance that money is always a concern of yours.  When two individuals are in a relationship, there are often issues that arise concerning money.  For some families, it is hard to get and stay on the same page, concerning finances. If at all possible, you will want to try avoid doing this, as it may not only harm your wallet, but your relationship as well.

One of the many problems associated with men and women, namely those who are in relationships is associated with checking accounts. In the United States, many checking accounts now come equipment with standard debit cards. While debit cards are a nice tool to have, they can cause many problems for some individuals.  Debit card purchases are not as easy to remember or record as traditional check writing purchases are. This is where many couples start to see discrepancies with their finances.

To prevent the above mentioned situation from occurring, it is important to make sure that you and your partner are on the same page. In fact, you may even want to take the time to establish some ground rules. These grounds rules may include not having a debit card at all or leaving it home at all times. If the debit card is used or a check is written for the joint account that you and your partner share, it is important that the person who used the account informs the other.  Communication is key to keeping your finances in check when having a joint checking account with your husband.

In addition to the improper use of debit cards or check writing, when using a joint checking account, there are many couples who have problems with one or both individuals just spending more money than they have.  This is often a problem with credit cards.  Credit cards, as you likely already know, are considered financial death traps, as they can cause so many problems.  For that reason, if you or your husband or your partner have any credit cards, it is advised that you sit down and discuss usage with them.  The best way to stay out of credit card debt is by limiting your use of them or at least your spending.  If spending is occurring, it is important that your partner knows about that spending and visa versa.

Since unnecessary spending is a problem for many couples in America, you may want to take the time to create a budget for your household. When doing this budget, it is important that you and your partner create the budget together.  This is how you two can both stay on the same page, with your finances.  A budget can account for all of the money that you and your partner have coming in, as well as all of the money that needs to be spent, like on rent, gasoline, or car insurance. This can give you an idea of exactly how much extra you and your partner have to spend each month or even how much you don’t have to spend.  As a reminder, be sure to create your budget with your husband or your partner.  

If you are married, you may find yourself having a little bit more trouble with the money issues between you and your husband. What many individuals do not realize is that when they are married their financial mistakes also become the financial mistakes of their spouse.  This is what leaves many women, and sometimes even men, having a difficult time getting back on their feet after a divorce.  It is not uncommon for many divorced couples to declare bankruptcy after terminating their relationship.  

To help prevent your marriage or your partnership from this trouble, you will want to keep all of the above mentioned points in mind.  Learning how to budget together, as a family, as well as properly use all bank accounts and credit cards is the best way to stay all on the same page.  Staying on the same page, when it comes to your finances, is the key to financial reassurance and possibly a happy healthy relationship with your husband or partner.
