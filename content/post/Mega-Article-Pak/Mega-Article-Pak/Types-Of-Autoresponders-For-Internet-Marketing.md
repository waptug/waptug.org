Types Of Autoresponders For Internet Marketing

There are several autoresponders available on the Internet, although they are divided into three main types – remotely hosted, locally hosted, and desktop hosted.  For many Internet marketers, locally and desktop hosted are far preferred over remotely hosted.  Although remote hosted are good, locally and desktop hosted autoresponders will allow you complete control – as you are running the program on your own site.

If you have a domain name, you can use as many autoresponders as you like, all of which will match your domain name.  When you use a remotely hosted program, you won’t be able to use your domain name with the autoresponder.  Instead, you’ll receive an address from the provider that resembles their link.  This can be great for some, although many prefer to have their own domain names listed in the autoresponder.

If you use your own domain name with your autoresponder, you can normally keep it secret that you are using an autoresponder.  When you send out emails using your autoresponder, it will display your website email, making it very hard to detect an autoresponder.  This can be a great way to use your autoresponder, especially if you don’t want your customers to know that you are using one.

If you use a remotely hosted autoresponder, those you send messages to with notice that you are using an autoresponder.  You should think of this from their prospective – if you were their customer, you probably wouldn’t want to receive messages from an autoresponder.  Instead, you would want to receive your emails and messages from someone real, giving you complete individual attention.

If you are just starting out with your company and happen to be on a tight budget, a remotely hosted autoresponder may very well be the best solution.  You can use it until you get more money and get back on track, although you shouldn’t use it long term.  Remotely hosted programs can get expensive very quickly; as the monthly charges will add it quick each month you use the program.

You can find remotely hosted autoresponders all over the Internet; all you have to do is run a search through a search engine like Google or Yahoo.  One of the best on the net is www.automatic-responder.com - Once you have found a website you can read more about them and what they have to offer.  If you like what you see, all you’ll need to do is sign up and then you begin using their services with a remotely hosted autoresponder.

Although locally hosted autoresponders are preferred, they do have disadvantages.  Some types will limit how many domains you can install them on.  If the vendor doesn’t provide free installation, you could have a problem installing the script, as most require some degree of technical experience.  Although you have complete control over the program, locally hosted programs don’t have as many features as remotely hosted programs.

Desktop hosted autoresponders are also great, although they too have disadvantages.  Some types will limit how many copies you can install on different computers.  To get the most from them, you’ll need a computer that is always connected to the Internet.  You’ll also need some experience to set them up, and they aren’t recommended for those who have large mailing lists.

Although there are 3 main types of autoresponders, the type you choose should depend on your website and your needs.  What’s the best idea for you may be completely useless to someone else.  When you make your final decision, you should always decide on what you need for your company – then pick an autoresponder that works best for you.
