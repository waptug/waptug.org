Introduction To Mountain Biking

Mountain biking is a great way to explore the outdoors, 
stay in shape, or just have fun. Racing down the side
of a mountain is a lot of fun indeed, although it can
also be quite dangerous.  Even though it's dangerous, 
if you ride with caution, it can be enjoyed by the 
entire family.

Styles of mountain biking
Mountain biking can best be characterized into three
different styles - downhill, free riding, and cross
country.  Even though the different styles are similar
in some ways, they still require different skills.  The
style that you pick will determine the type of bike you
get.

Locations for mountain biking
The sport can best be thought of as biking on an unpaved
surface.  Many areas throughout North America have 
specific locations designed for mountain biking.  Before
you decide to go down a trail, you should always check 
with your local park to get the routes, regulations, and
any rules that they may have.

You can also find groups that have mountain bike rides 
and competitions.  You can look on the internet or even
in a local paper and see exactly what's available in your
area.  You may be able to find groups for the more 
advanced riders as well as beginners.

Becoming a great biker
Endurance and stamina are a must for a great mountain
biker.  It will also take ambition and practice to succeed
as well as conquer the course.  Like all other sports,
it takes time and practice.  Those just beginning will
have to get past the bumps and bruises from falling
off the bike.

Selecting your mountain bike
The bike you select is more of a personal choice, and
a big determining factor on the type of riding you will
be doing.  Bikes come in all styles, shapes, and prices, 
which will make selecting one for yourself very difficult
indeed.  

You should use the internet to help you shop for a bike, 
even do some price comparisons online as well before you
make a purchase.  Before you buy a bike, always ask to
try it out first.  A great mountain biker will become 
one with his or her own bike.  When buying, make sure
you check for comfort, how it fits, even how it is geared.

Staying safe when riding
Mountain bike riding on unpaved roads can be very 
dangerous, as mentioned earlier.  Anytime you are riding,
you should wear a helmet, along with knee and elbow
pads.  If you are following a group or riding in the 
woods you should strongly consider a pair of goggles as
well.  Safety should be your top priority and never 
taken lightly anytime you are mountain biking.
