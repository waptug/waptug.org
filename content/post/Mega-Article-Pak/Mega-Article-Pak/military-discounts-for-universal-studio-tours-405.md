Military Discounts for Universal Studios Tours

Universal Studios Tours is proud of the men and 
women who serve the United States of America, 
and to reward them for the great service that they 
provide, specially priced tickets are offered. These 
tickets are available for all active duty military 
personnel, retirees, DOD personnel, members of the 
National Guard, Reserves, all other military 
personnel, and all dependants.

If you are unsure whether you qualify for these 
special military prices, you should contact your 
Commander, Universal Studios, or Commander, 
Navy Region, Southwest at 619-767-6000. 

In order to benefit from the special military prices, 
your tickets must be purchased in advance. These 
specially priced tickets are not available at the gate, 
online, or over the telephone. Instead, these tickets 
can only be purchased from MWR ITT/ITR offices 
located throughout the United States. You must 
present a military or US Government Identification 
card when purchasing these specially priced tickets.

If for any reason your local base does not have 
tickets available for purchase, they will order them 
for you. This typically takes about five days, so take 
this into consideration when planning your trip – get 
your tickets as early as possible. Don’t wait too late, 
or your tickets will not arrive in time for your 
scheduled leave, and you will have to pay the full 
price for admission into the park. No exceptions will 
be made.

The only way you can order your tickets by 
telephone, and still receive the special military 
prices is by contacting the Commander, Navy 
Region, Southwest at 619-767-6000. Your tickets 
will be mailed to you, and should arrive within 
seven business days. Overnight service may be 
available, but there will be an additional fee. Do not 
call the regular phone number for Universal Studio 
tickets or you will be charged the regular price. 
You will be charged the regular full price if you 
order your tickets online, purchase them through a 
Ticket Masters Outlet, or order them through a 
travel agent as well.

The special military rates do not apply to tickets 
that are sold through the Universal Studios 
Hollywood Box Office. Again, for more information 
on these specially prices military tickets for 
Universal Studios Tours, contact your local base 
MWR ticket office or Commander, Navy Region, 
Southwest at 619-767-6000.

Universal Studios welcomes military personnel. If 
you have served your country, make sure that you 
take advantage of these very special military prices 
– they were hard earned, and are well deserved!
