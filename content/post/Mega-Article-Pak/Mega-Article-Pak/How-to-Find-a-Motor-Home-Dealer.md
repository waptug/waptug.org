If you know of anyone, like a family member, friend, coworker, or neighbor who has recently bought a motor home, you may want to think about asking them for information on where they made their motor home purchase from. Even if someone that you know hasn’t purchased a motor home themselves, they may have come across a motor home dealer in their travels.
