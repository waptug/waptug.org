Benefits Of Carpet

In the past and even today, carpet is very popular 
with home owners all across the U.S.  Carpet is
the most practical, fashionable, and versatile 
choice of flooring out there, as it also accounts
for more than half of all flooring purchases that
are made each and every year.  The fact is, carpet
has outsold every other type of flooring for more 
than 60 years.

Carpet offers you several advantages that other
flooring options can't compete with.  Below, you
will find many of the features that carpet will
add to your home.

Warmth
Carpet is the best choice you can make for your
bedroom, family room, and other areas where you 
need warmth underfoot.  

Insulation
Both carpet and carpet padding will provide an
extra layer of much needed insulation between the 
floors of your home.  Depending on the density and
weight of the carpet, it contributes to the R-value
of your home, which adds to the energy efficiency
as well.

Safety
Carpet offers a slip resistant surface that will
prevent accidents along with a natural cushion
in the event of someone falling.  For young
children and the elderly, this is very important.

Reduction in sound
Carpet will also reduce noise better than any
other type of flooring.  Carpet works to dampen
noise in three ways:
	1.  Reduces surface noise from foot traffic
	2.  Absorbs airborne sound
	3.  Blocks transmission of sound 
These qualities are valuable in apartments as well
as semi-detached homes.

Surface
Adding carpet to a room can also disguise any
existing damage to the floor and also hide any
other problems such as warped floors.  The thicker
density the carpet is, the more problems it will
be able to hide.

Easy to care for
The carpets of today are more stain resistant
than they have ever been in the past, which makes
cleaning even the worst possible spills easier
than ever.  No matter type of spill it may be,
there is always a way to clean it up.  

Clean air
Research has proven that carpet can indeed improve
the quality of air by trapping allergy causing
dust and allergens if it is properly cleaned and
maintained.  

Variety of use
Carpets aren't only for floors anymore, which is
a really great thing.  You can easily add carpet
to steps, stairs, walls, posts, and other non
level surfaces, without having to worry about it
slipping, lifting, or buckling.

Flexibility
Carpet is the primary foundation in almost any
room.  Because it is available in a variety of
different colors and textures, it helps to 
create an unlimited number of possibilities for
decorating.  From the neutral tones to rich
solids, carpet is the first step you can take
to make your home look better than ever.

Low cost
Carpet doesn't cost a lot of money, as it offers
an economical alternative to the other types of
expensive flooring.  Even with professional
installation, you won't pay near as much as you
would for hard surfaces.  Unlike hard surfaces,
carpet can keep you comfortable if you decide
to lay down on it.

Life span
The carpets of today are very durable and can
outlast most other types of flooring available on
the market.  All you have to do is select a
type of carpet that has a life span of 5 - 30
years or more, which is very common now days.

Warranty
With most manufacturers, you can get great 
warranties with your carpet purchase.  This way,
you'll be protected when you install your new
carpet.  Once installed, all you have to do is
enjoy it - as the warranty will ensure that you
are very well protected.
