Breast Feeding Toddlers

Because more and more women are choosing to breast
feed their babies, more and more are also finding
that they enjoy it enough to continue longer than
the first few months they planned on.  Breast
feeding to 3 - 4 years of age is common in much
of the world recently, and is still common in
many societies for toddlers to be breast fed.

Because mothers and babies often enjoy to breast
feed, you shouldn't stop it.  After six months,
many think that breast milk loses it's value -
which isn't true.  Even after six months, it 
still contains protein, fat, and other important
nutrients which babies and children need.

The fact is, immune factors in breast milk will
protect the baby against infections.  Breast
milk also contains factors that will help the 
immune system mature, and other organs to develop
and mature as well.

It's been shown and proven in the past that 
children in daycare who are still breast feeding
have far less severe infections than the 
children that aren't breast feeding.  The mother
will lose less work time if she chooses to 
continue nursing her baby once she is back to
work.

If you have thought about breast feeding your
baby once he gets passed 6 months of age, you 
have made a wise decision.  Although many feel
that it isn't necessary, breast milk will always
help babies and toddlers.  Breast milk is the
best milk you can give to your baby.

No matter what others may tell you, breast feeding
only needs to be stopped when you and the baby
agree on it.  You don't have to stop when someone
else wants you to - you should only stop when 
you feel that it's the right time.
