Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is the revenue sharing between
online advertisers (and merchants) and online 
salespeople.  Compensation and pay is based on
performance measures, normally in the form of clicks,
sales, and registrations.

The advertisers and merchants are normally referred
to as affiliate merchants, and publishers or sales
people are known as affiliates.

The many benefits of affiliate marketing include 
the potential for making lots of money.  You can
automate a lot of the advertising process and
receive payment only for desired results, which
includes sales, registrations, and clicks.

Even though most merchants will assume some level
of risk with fraud, there is still a level of risk
involved.  Once you know what you're doing with 
affiliate marketing, you'll be on top well before
you know it.

rise of many companies online, including Amazon.com.

marketing, and now has thousands of affiliate
