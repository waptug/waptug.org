How To Choose A Breast Pump

The milk production in the breasts, much like so many
other things, work on the shear principal of supply
and demand.  The more breast milk your baby consumes,
the more your body will need to make.  

Breast pumps are generally used to insure continued
production of breast milk when you cannot feed your
baby - whether you are back to work, traveling, taking
medication, or just out of town.  

Basic types of pumps
Breast pumps can either be battery operated, hand
operated, semi automatic electric, or even self cycling
electric.

Hand pumps
Manual hand pumps are designed to use the strength
of your hand or arm muscles for pumping one breast at
a time.  You can also get pumps that will use the leg
and foot muscles for pumping both breasts at one 
time.  Mothers that with carpal tunnel syndrome may
want to consider using a pump designed for the arm
or leg muscles or even an automatic model.

Battery operated pumps
Pumps with battery operation are the best for women
who have an established supply of milk and want to
pump once or even twice a day.  These pumps use 
batteries to create suction, minimizing any type of
muscle fatigue.  Most battery type pumps are designed
for pumping one breast at a time and are recommended
for occasional usage.

Electric pumps
Even though electric pumps are more efficient than
hand or even battery operated pumps, they also tend
to be more expensive.  You can however, rent them if
you need to.  Electric pumps can normally plug
directly into an outlet and are designed for pumping
both breasts at a time and even frequent use.  Hospital
grade pumps are the most efficient for initiating and
maintaining milk supply, and are available for rent
or purchase.
