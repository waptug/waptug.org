Transitioning into the pH miracle diet 

The pH miracle diet is one of the most revolutionary diets to grow in popularity in the past few years. The eating principles of the diet (vegetarian, organic foods) are not new, but the addition of the “pH factor” is definitely something that has not been readily seen in the world of nutrition. The acid/alkaline balance of our bodies is something that many people have never heard of, although the concepts have been part of Chinese medicine for thousands of years. The pH miracle diet may seem strange upon your first encounter, but once you find out more about the concepts and benefits you’ll be impressed and motivated to try this way of eating.

The pH miracle diet is a definite transition from the standard American diet. If you are embarking on a journey to health and plan to use the pH miracle diet you will definitely experience a transition in your life. This diet requires you to think about food and eating in an entirely new way. You’ll be challenging old stereotypes about nutrition, such as meat is an important part of every meal and milk is beneficial to your health. It can be difficult to make a completely 180-degree turn in your way of eating and cooking.

However, in order to have success on the pH miracle diet, you don’t have to make that 180-degree turn in just one week. The book outlines 7 specific steps for dietary change. They do not all have to be done at once. If you radically change your diet and are eating unfamiliar foods, cooking unfamiliar recipes and missing out on your favorite meals, you will not stay on the diet for very long, no matter how healthy it is. The best approach to adapting the pH miracle diet is to do it slowly and at your own pace.

Taking a slower approach is also helpful because it will help you understand how the diet is affecting your body. Even if you’ve read the book a dozen times and understand all of the science behind the acid/alkaline balance, you won’t really know it well until you’ve done it yourself. Incorporating this new way of eating into your body step by step will allow you to feel the effects of the acid/alkaline process. You can measure the science against your personal opinion and how your body responds.

Everybody is different and you may find as you start the program that certain aspects of the program don’t work for you. Maybe you cannot go vegetarian completely, or you find it difficult to go without certain acid-forming fruits. Testing out the principles of the pH miracle diet on your own body will allow you to decide what works and what doesn’t. The goal of the diet is find a balance of 70% alkaline and 30% acid foods. This means that you can still enjoy the foods that you love as long as they are balanced by alkalizing foods.

The transition to an ideal pH diet balance is something you should take at your own pace. This is particularly true if you have had a diet full of acid-forming foods or if you have any major health problems. Your body will need time to respond to this new way of eating and adjust to operating on natural foods. The transition into pH balanced eating is a journey that should be traveled in incremental steps.
