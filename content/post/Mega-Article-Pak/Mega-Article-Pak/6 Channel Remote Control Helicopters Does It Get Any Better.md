6 Channel Remote Control Helicopters: Does It Get Any Better?

If you are really looking for some fun, then you should check out 6 channel remote control helicopters, which seem to be becoming the great new pastime.  You can purchase these really strong and powerful helicopters from your local helicopter and other electronics shop, or from a trades store, and you can use them outdoors or indoors.

They are extremely versatile, and any helicopter flyer will tell you that they are some of the most impressive technologies in helicopters out on the market today.  Specifically, the 6 channels allow you to control multiple facets of the helicopter’s flight patterns.  For instance, you can make the helicopter fly straight up, straight down, forward, backwards, and some models even let you tumble them in tight circles in the air.

Yes, this technology tends to be a little more pricey than your typical fly-straight-forward helicopter, but at the same time, these helicopters are so much more true to life.  Helicopters that are actually flown by people in cockpits, rather than people holding remotes on the ground, have many different channels—sometimes a lot more than six, even, but at least getting closer to the number of channels in a real helicopter is truly a feat.  I remember reading a little bit about these 6 channel remote control helicopters, and they were even more impressive than I had initially thought.  In addition to the control you have over all the different flight patterns, you also can customize the types of blades, the body of the helicopter, and even have a custom paint job done.  Of course, these amenities all run into more money, but the pleasure of having a 6 channel remote control helicopter that is truly original and unique to their collection sometimes outweighs the price for many helicopter enthusiasts.

So I was really surprised when own of my closest friends and a fellow helicopter flyer said that he’d had a bad experience with his 6 channel remote control helicopter.  I asked exactly what happened, and it turned out that he had left his helicopter unattended, and some young school children had found it in his backyard and taken it to a park.

They then proceeded to have a great time with it, only later returning it, in a much banged- up condition, to its rightful owner.  At first my friend didn’t even realize it had been used and just thought that the scratches and dents that he had discovered were there all along and just went unnoticed by him.  It was only after he took it to the manufacturer to inquire about the warranty that he learned the truth.  Luckily the children had some conscience and they eventually paid him back and apologized, but he has a bad opinion of 6 channel remote control helicopters since then, and the sad thing is that it’s really not the helicopter’s fault, it was just a bad experience.

Hopefully, he’ll come around someday soon, because the 6 channel remote control helicopters are really some of the best, most controllable helicopters you can buy in the world today.
