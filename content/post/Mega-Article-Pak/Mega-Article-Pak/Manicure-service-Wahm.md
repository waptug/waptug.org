Manicure service Wahm

A unique and fun Wahm career is to start a manicure service. If you have a license in cosmetology, or are thinking of getting one, you aren’t limited to working in a salon. Many women are now looking for a more relaxed manicure experience, and you can provide them that by starting a manicure service in your home or a traveling manicure service. You can go into business for yourself with little start up costs and great rewards.

To start with you’ll need to get your license to manicure nails, if you don’t have one already. You’ll need to post your license in your place of business and also have extra copies just in case the original gets lost or damaged. If you decide to offer a travel manicure service, you’ll need a copy of your license to put in your bag. You’ll also want to have a system for keeping track of money set up before you begin. You can use a computer program like QuickBooks to track your money flow, or do it by hand in a traditional ledger. Appointment books and receipts are also a necessity. Finally, getting a business telephone number is a necessary step in setting yourself up as a professional in your field.

The other necessary step is gathering all of your supplies and finding a convenient way to carry them from your home to the client’s home. You’ll need to bring your polish colors, manicure tools, nail polish remover, appointment book, receipt book and necessary supplies (including extra towels and cotton balls).

Traveling to a client’s home is not for everyone, but there are many benefits to offering a travel manicure service. From your customer’s perspective it is much more enjoyable to have you come to them. One of the biggest drawbacks of getting a manicure out of the home for your client is that she has to drive home and avoid damaging the fresh polish. When you come to your client’s home, she won’t have to worry about ruining her new manicure. 

Although you won’t technically be a Wahm when you offer a traveling manicure service, you will have many benefits. If you offer manicures in client homes, you’ll reduce the number of people coming in and out of your home each day. In addition, you’ll be able to use your mileage as a tax write-off (make sure to keep accurate records of how much you drive for your business). Working at home can be isolating, so getting out of the house to do manicures can be a break in your day.

Advertising your business can happen in many different ways. You can leave your business cards at local Laundromats, convenience stores, gift shops and daycare centers. You can also put flyers up at bulletin boards around town. Network with people that you already have contact with, like the parents at your children’s school, your husband’s co-workers and your former co-workers. Tell people that you are starting a business and get excited about it. Share with everyone you can think of. Before you know it, you’ll have a list of consistent clients who you manicure each month, or week.

Starting a manicure service can be a great way to work at home and do something that you love. Instead of paying high fees for a chair at a salon, start your own business and have the flexibility and income that you deserve.
