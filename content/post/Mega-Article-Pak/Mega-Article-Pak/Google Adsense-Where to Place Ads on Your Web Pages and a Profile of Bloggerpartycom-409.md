Google Adsense: Where to Place Ads on Your Web Pages and a Profile of Bloggerparty.com

Deciding Where to Place Your Google Ads on Your Web Pages so That They Will Be Most Profitable

This is one of the best parts of the whole Google Adsense experience. No one else gets to make this decision except you.  It’s your page.  You get to decide how many ( up to 3 ads per page), what colors and shapes you will use and on what part of the page the ad will be placed.  Should you place your ads at the top or bottom?  In the middle of the text?  To the left or right?

The most important decision should be based on the needs of the visitors to your site?  What are they looking for? Are they there to read or merely to browse.  If they are there to read an entire article, say, you might try placing your ads at the bottom of the page so they will have something to do next.  Some publishers swear by placing the ads at the top left of the page because they think customers look there first.

The fun thing is experimenting with all the possibilities.  Try different ad locations and different colors for a week and note the differences in your reports.  When you hit on something successful, you’ll see the difference. 

Profile of Bloggerparty.com For Those Who May Want To Use it For Google Ads

Blogger Party is another blog hosting website where you can make money with Google Adsense.  You create an account and use the publisher id you got when you created your Google Adsense account.  If you have not done that yet, that is the first step to making money with your blogs.

At bloggerparty.com,  targeted Google Adsense ads will be displayed on your blog pages.  Fifty percent of that time, the ads will have your Google Adsense publishers ID and the other fifty percent of the time they will have Blogger Party’s Adsense ID or split between them and the person who referred you.  That’s right, referrals get 25% of the ad time, which comes out of Blogger Party’s share and not the original blogger’s or the referral’s.

Blogger Party promises “party points” any time you write something or comment on someone else’s blog.  They don’t do anything as yet, but later you will be able to trade them in for prizes according to Blogger Party’s admin.
