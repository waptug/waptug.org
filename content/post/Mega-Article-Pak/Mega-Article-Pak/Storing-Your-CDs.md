Storing Your CDs

There are many different storage alternatives for
your CD collection.  The factors for storage include
how many CDs you own and how long you plan to keep
them.  

Below, you will find several alternatives for 
storing your CDs:

1.  CD jewel cases
You have probably owned these before, as they are 
the most common. They can hold your CD cover art and
are very easy to line up on a shelf.  Keep in mind
that they do break rather easily and they take up
quite a bit of space.

2.  Plastic CD sleeves
Plastic sleeves are cheap and thin, so they are
easy to afford and easy on shelf space.  Since they
are so thin, they obviously don't offer a lot in
terms of protection. For long term storage, they
generally aren't recommended.  

3.  Paper sleeves
For short term storage needs, paper is very cheap
and doesn't use much space.  Simliar to plastic
sleeves, paper is thin and doesn't offer very 
much protection.

4.  Paperboard sleeves
Paperboard sleeves are much thicker than paper so
they will protect your discs.  They are also
inexpensive, although they can be hard to seal.

5.  Tyvek CD sleeves
Tyvek sleeves are cheap and they don't take up 
a lot of space.  For long term storage, Tyvek is
normally recommended.  

6.  CD-ROM disc cases
These types of cases can hold a lot of CDs in a
small space and they may even help to keep out
dust.  They do however, make reading labels a bit
hard, they keep CDs out of site, and they will 
take up a lot of space.

7.  CD spindles
Spindles are cheap and they hold several hundred
CDs in a small stack.  Sorting through them is
hard if you need one specific disk, which makes
it something that isn't normally recommended.
