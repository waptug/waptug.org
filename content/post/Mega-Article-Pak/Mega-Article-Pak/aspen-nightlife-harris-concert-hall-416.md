Aspen Nightlife – Harris Concert Hal

There is always something going on in Aspen, 
Colorado and the Aspen nightlife is very active. 
You can find a wide variety of things to do – but 
if you want a little culture, you should definitely 
find out what events are planned at the Harris 
Concert Hall. 

At the Harris Concert Hall, you will find 
everything from Piano Recitals to Rock-n-Roll 
Concerts. Events are planned well in advance, 
so you should be able to find out what concerts 
and events are scheduled to coincide with your 
Aspen vacation. 

The Harris Concert Hall is located in the West 
end of Aspen, in a quaint residential 
neighborhood. Due to parking and traffic 
problems, you should strongly consider 
walking to the concert hall. It is a short ten 
minute walk from the downtown area. Other 
transportation options include biking or taking 
the bus. When there are events at the concert,
it is very difficult to find parking.

The Aspen Music Festival and School were 
founded in 1949 by Walter and Elizabeth 
Paepcke from Chicago. Many music 
professionals train here and all of the school 
and festival performances take place in the 
Harris Concert Hall, which seats over 2000 
people.

You should definitely try to visit Aspen during 
the Music Festival. This takes place over a nine 
week period in the summer, and there are 
usually more than 200 planned events. People 
from all over the world come to the Aspen 
Music Festival, so be sure that you make your 
plans and reservations early!

Another exciting event that takes place at the 
Harris Concert Hall is the Aspen Film Festival. 
This festival takes place three times each year. 
The Aspen Shortsfest is held in the Spring. The
 Aspen Filmfest is held during the Fall, and the 
Aspen Academy Screenings are held during the 
Winter. Again, people come from all over the 
world for these events, so make your plans 
early.

The Harris Concert Hall is full of history, even 
though the newest section of it wasn’t built 
until recently. This is a major part of Aspen’s 
history and culture, and you should try to attend 
at least one event at the Harris Concert Hall 
while you are in Aspen. Most events take place 
in the evening; however there are also events 
that take place during the day. You can check 
with your lodge or hotel to find out what events 
are planned at the Concert Hall each day. Also 
inquire about the need to purchase advance 
tickets for specific events.
