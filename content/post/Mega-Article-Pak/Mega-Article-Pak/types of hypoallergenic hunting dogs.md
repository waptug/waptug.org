Types of Hypoallergenic Hunting Dogs

Hunting dogs, though traditionally used for hunting small game including foxes, rabbits, and others, have become household pets to many. Intelligent, graceful, and energetic, these dogs can bring joy and comfort to any home. Hypoallergenic hunting dogs are available for those who have problems with dog allergies. Three popular breeds include the German Shorthaired Pointer, the Afghan Hound, and the Basenji. 

The German Shorthaired Pointer still used for hunting purposes today, is also considered a good choice for a family dog. The dog has a short coat that can be brushed easily. A short coat will not shed as much as longer coats and will not hold as much dander either. This is why the German Shorthaired Pointer is an excellent choice for those who suffer from allergies. Long and lean, these dogs are very friendly and enjoy getting their exercise. Not much extra care is needed as the dogs do not have to be groomed often and they should only be bathed when they are extremely dirty. 

A cross between a German Pointer and an English Pointer, the German Shorthaired Pointer is a good dog to have when on a hunt. The dog responds to noise and movement very quickly and is a loyal companion to have when outdoors. 

The Afghan Hound may not look like a hypoallergenic dog with its long hair, but since the hair is similar to human hair, the dogs do not shed as frequently, which cause fewer allergy issues for owners and those who visit. While this dog was once used to hunt foxes, wolves, and deer, it is not longer used today. Instead, it is kept as a pet or for dog showing. With its beautiful brown coat, this dog is a showpiece. 

The Afghan hound is a pleasant dog, but it does not take commands as often as it should. Unlike other hypoallergenic breeds, this dog will ignore commands made by its owner on occasion as it tries to maintain its independence. If you are looking for a dog that is easy to control, the Afghan Hound may not be the one for you. 

The Basenji is one of the few breeds of hypoallergenic dog that does not bark. It will imitate sounds heard in its environment, but it does not bark on its own. Instead, the dog will yelp once or twice, but otherwise, it is a very quiet breed. If you live in an apartment, this dog is a good choice. Small dogs that originated in Africa, the Basenji is no longer used for hunting. The dog has shorter hair that does not shed as often. This is another reason why it is a popular hypoallergenic breed. 

The Basenji, like the Afghan Hound does not take commands too often from owners. The dog is quiet, but likes to explore new places. This dog has been compared to a cat in terms of its behavior and temperament. While you may be able to train the dog to perform certain tasks, many times the Basenji will not want to obey.
