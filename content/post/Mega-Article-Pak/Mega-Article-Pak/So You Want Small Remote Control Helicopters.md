So You Want Small Remote Control Helicopters?

If you are trying to learn more about small remote control helicopters, perhaps for yourself or for a gift, then you’ve come to the right place.  I am not personally an expert in small remote control helicopters, but I know many people who are, and I was able to get some insider information about purchasing them and caring for them.

Most of the people that I speak with about small remote control helicopters recommend being very careful when you purchase one, because so many of the tiny parts in these helicopters can crack or break apart even before you get them home, and you’ll never be able to fly them.  So the number one thing that people recommend when you are thinking about purchasing a small remote control helicopter is to see if you can get a manufacturer’s warranty on parts for at least five years.  Such a warranty may be hard to come by, but even if it costs a bit extra to get one, the piece of mind associated with such a warranty is invaluable.

You can play as hard as you want with your small remote control helicopters and if you have warranties for parts you can rest assured that if anything breaks, you are covered and you don’t have to go out and purchase an entire new helicopter.  I have even heard of people getting lifetime warranties for their helicopters, but these are few and far between, and are often not available in the market of small remote control helicopters.

That said, five year warranties are not unheard of, and you can have five wonderful carefree years with your small remote control helicopters and the knowledge that you don’t have to worry about every bump and bruise.  Many people choose small remote control helicopters over their larger counterparts because they are useful when you don’t have much space for storage—perhaps you’re in your twenties and still live in a studio apartment—but you still want to  pursue the challenge and the fun of having an flying small remote control helicopters.  If this sounds like you, then small remote control helicopters are the best bet.  If on the other hand, you are more interested in larger helicopters, and you have the space, the time, and the muscles to carry them around and live near a large open expanse where you can fly them, then a larger model might better suit you.  I generally find that people are more impressed by larger models, just because it seems less likely that they will be capable of flying, because they seem like such large and cumbersome contraptions.

So, when they are up in the air and flying gracefully, people are very impressed.  But the smaller models are still very nice, and they’re often a great starter helicopter to learn on before you make the investment in a larger model.  You could also get a large one second hand and see whether you think they are worth the investment, and then perhaps purchase a large helicopter new at a later date.
