"What to Know About Weight Loss Products"

There are a lot of weight loss products that offer that fast weight loss results, however, are these really guaranteed?  Could these products live up to their assurance of a fit body? 

In US, there is an estimated 50 million people who try to lose weigh, unfortunately, only 5 per cent are successful.  One thing's for sure, beware of fraudulent claims and extreme high cost because there is no magic to losing weight.

Samples of weight loss products in the market nowadays:

·	Diet Patch – this was already removed since 1990’s by FDA since they were proven ineffective.
·	Magnetic Diet Pills – allegedly flushes out fat, but not.
·	Guar Gum – causes internal obstruction.
·	Electrical Muscle Stimulators – no proven effect.
·	Eyeglasses that Suppress Appetite – These claims that the projected image on the retina decreases appetite.  No proven fact.
·	Weight loss earrings – through acupuncture, suppresses appetite.

There are also examples of weight loss products:

Diet drinks that are mixed with beverages or food are used as meal substitutes.  A downside of this is that once a person stopped taking the drinks, they would eventually regain the lost weight after a short period of time due to feeling of emptiness in the stomach.  Another is diet supplements and medicines that also don’t work long-term.  Over-the-counter pills that compose of phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride may raise blood pressure and palpitation.  Ephedra on the other hand can cause serious side effects such as heart problems, seizure, stroke, and even death. E.g.:

§	Herbalife Nutritional Program – good as two meals, dieters may rely on shakes and follow artificial dieting methods and just don’t want food to work into their lives.
§	Mega-Thin 100 Formula – Its formula contains an anti-fat weapon, however, diet is not emphasized that’s why it’s concluded that it has an appetite suppressant.
§	Nestlé’s Sweet Success – recommended to take three times a day and it does not promote healthy eating habits.  Weight loss is difficult to maintain once intake is stopped.
§	Ultra Slim Fast – this plan requires regular exercise but does not teach good eating habits.
§	Diet pills with Ephedra and PPA – many of these have enclosed diet plans.  Slimming can come from the diet plan and not the pill intake and there are risks of adverse side effects.
§	Chitosan products – contains fibers which were taken from shellfish that may cause diarrhea, bloatedness, and gas.  This will only work if a low fat diet is practiced.
§	Chromium Supplements –claim that products will lower blood sugar, body fat and cholesterol but causes anemia and even memory loss.  Studies show only minimal or no beneficial effect at all. 
§	Green Tea Extract Products – known as strong anti-oxidants that help lower cholesterol and triglycerides, and promote weight loss, however, the caffeine content could cause insomnia and restlessness.
§	Algae Tablets - Spirulina contains significant nutrients that can be an acceptable food when used as part of a varied diet but are very expensive.
§	St. John's Wort Supplement - Claims that it will suppress appetite and promote weight loss but it could lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, tiredness, sleeplessness, and arouse allergic reactions.
§	Glucomannan Products – claim that two capsules before each meal decrease food absorption.  Known as food thickeners but not yet proven safe or effective.  Weight loss will only happen if good diet plan is followed.

Even if you plan on using over-the-counter weight supplements or even participate in a weight loss activity, the verdict is that you still have to eat fewer calories than you burn to lose weight. When choosing a weight loss product or program, collect as much information as possible.
