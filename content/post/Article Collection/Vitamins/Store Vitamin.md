How to Store Vitamins

There are two main types of vitamins, water soluble vitamins and fat soluble vitamins, and the way that the body does or does not store vitamin content taken from food depends on which type it is. The body cannot store water soluble vitamins and this means that a person needs to replenish their water soluble vitamin intake on a daily basis. The eight B vitamins and vitamin C are water soluble vitamins and the body cannot store vitamin content that is either of these. 

It is not simply that the body cannot store vitamins that are water soluble but also the water soluble vitamins are easily destroyed by improper storage, handling, or cooking of foods that contain these vitamins. In particular, it is important not to overcook vegetables by boiling as the water soluble vitamins are in effect washed out of them but this lack of being able to store vitamins that are water soluble can be overcome by light cooking or steaming and by using the water that vegetable have been cooked in to form sauces and gravies. As the body cannot store vitamin C or the other water soluble vitamins it is essential to eat a balanced diet with at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables to ensure that enough vitamins are available for the body to use when necessary and a person does not suffer from a vitamin deficiency due to the bodyâ€™s inability to store vitamin content.

On the other hand, the body can store vitamin content that is fat soluble. The body will store vitamin content in the fat cells so that it can be used when required and a person does not need to consume as many of these fat soluble vitamins on as frequent a basis as they do with water soluble vitamins. The fat cells store vitamin A, D, E, and K as these are all fat soluble vitamins.

It is also important to store vitamin supplements correctly to ensure that the beneficial qualities of these are not diminished. The best way to store vitamin supplements is in a container with a screw top lid and to keep the container in a dry place. When you store vitamin supplements it is also essential to check that they have not been kept longer than the expiration date. The vitamin content of supplements cannot be guaranteed if you store vitamin tablets past their use by date.
