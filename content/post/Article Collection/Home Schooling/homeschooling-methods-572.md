Homeschooling Methods

For many people, homeschooling may call to mind the picture of two
or three children sitting at a table and writing feverishly in 
their workbooks, while mom or dad stands nearby. This is the not 
entirely true. There are different methods of homeschooling, 
and the method you choose will decide the curriculum and your 
style of teaching. Given below are some of the most influential 
and popular homeschooling methods.

The Charlotte Mason method: 
Charlotte Mason is known as the founder of the homeschooling 
movement. A homeschooler herself, she was passionate in her zeal 
to lay out the foundations for an effective a complete 
homeschooling program that is fun and educational at the same 
time. This method focuses on all the core subjects with emphasis 
placed on classical literature, poetry, fine arts, classical music 
and craft. Mason used a variety of books from classical 
literature, which she called 'Living Books'. Since this method 
encourages a passionate awareness of literature, the child is read 
to daily from the 'Living Books'. After this, the child is asked 
to narrate what she has heard. This process begins at the age of 
six, and by ten the child is expected to write her narrations in 
her book. Mason also advocated the use of 'Nature Diaries'. After 
each short and interesting lesson, the child is asked to go to 
Nature and draw observations from Nature. Thus the child also 
gains a sense of respect for her environment. Mason believed that 
development of good character and behavior was essential to the 
complete development of the child's personality.

The Eclectic Homeschooling:
This is a mixture of various homeschooling techniques. Here, the 
innovative parents trust their own judgment and pick out the 
topics that make the best curriculum for their child. Such parents 
continuously look out for the best products that will meet the 
needs of their homeschoolers. Most Eclectic homeschooling 
curriculums are improvised. This means that the basic curriculum 
is ready-made. The parents then make changes in the curriculum to 
accommodate the individual needs and interests of their children. 
The child's gifts, temperament, learning style and interests 
dictate the curriculum. Eclectic programs include visits to the 
museum, libraries and factories.

Unschooling:
A Boston public educator name John Holt laid the beginnings of the 
unschooling method. He believed that children learned best when 
they are free to learn at their own pace and when they are guided 
by their own interests. His message was to 'unschool' the child. 
This method is a hands-on approach to learning, where the parent 
takes definite cues from the children. There is no definite 
curriculum, schedules or materials. This method is the most 
unstructured of the various homeschooling techniques.


The Montessori Method:
This method began in Italy, when it was observed that children 
have acute sensitive periods, during which they undergo periods of 
intense concentration. During such phases, a child will repeat an 
activity till he gains a measure of self-satisfaction. The 
Montessori method depends on a prepared environment to facilitate 
learning. All the materials used in this method are designed to 
satisfy the inner desire for spiritual development of the child. 
The materials used progress from simple to complex, and are rather 
expensive. 

These are just a few of the methods of homeschooling. Whatever the 
method, the underlying factor is flexibility and a keen interest 
in the desires of the child. The secret is to use the child's 
desire for knowledge to further his education.
