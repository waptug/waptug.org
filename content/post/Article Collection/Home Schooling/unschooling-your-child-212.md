Unschooling your child

Unschooling is the most fluid style of homeschooling. There is no 
curriculum and no set boundaries. Many parents feel a bit 
apprehensive about such freedom. But, even unschooling has certain 
guidelines that make it a great method of homeschooling

Firstly, allow your child to express interests. Let her select the 
topic. If she wants to learn about flowers, tell her about the 
various flowers, their functions, parts of the flower, rare flowers 
etc. But don't go overboard. Allow her the freedom to stop when 
she has had enough. This process of learning may take a month or a 
day. It is up to the child to decide how much she wants to learn.

Expand your child's areas of interests using videos, books, magazines, 
puzzles and games. Go to a museum or take her to a library. 
Simultaneously, broaden your own interests. The more you know, the 
more the child gets to learn.

Notice all opportunities for learning. When in the kitchen, point out 
the vitamins in fruits and vegetables. What makes tomatoes red, and 
why are leafy vegetables good? If you don't know the answers, don't 
worry. Look it up. Lastly, don't worry if the going seems slow. This 
is just the way kids learn. Give them time and lots of encouragement.
