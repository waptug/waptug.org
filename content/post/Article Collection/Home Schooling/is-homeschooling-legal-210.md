Is Homeschooling legal?

Without a doubt, homeschooling is legal in all the 50 States of
the U.s. But, that is just about where the similarity ends. Laws 
and regulations regarding homeschooling vary from state to state. 
Interpretations of these laws can vary from scholl district to 
school district. Additionally, these laws may change every year. 

The National Home Education network is a wonderful resource when 
it comes to the legalities of homeschooling. It has a listing of 
the actual state laws for each state in the U.S. Reading the laws 
that pertain to your state is perhaps the best way to get accurate 
information about these laws. But, most people need to get the 
laws interpreted by a qualified attorney. You can get valuable 
information from the support group at your locality. Additionally, 
many state education departments have online resources that will 
help you in interpreting the state requirements for homeschooling. 
The internet is also a good source of information. 

It is a good idea to check out your state laws regarding 
homeschooling before you start educating your child at home. This 
will prevent any nasty surprises on the way. If you have to move, 
you will need to be aware of any tests or exams that your child 
may need to take.
