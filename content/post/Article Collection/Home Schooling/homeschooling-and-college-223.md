Homeschooling and college

As children grow out of their little pants and are ready to begin
their teens, many parents wonder if they should continue with the 
homeschooling program. They fear that colleges may not give equal 
opportunities to a child educated at home. 

Many fears of this kind were put to rest when 2 homeschooled boys 
got admission into Harvard. Harvard does not require a high school 
diploma for gaining admission to their degree program. Many 
colleges are more interested in the knowledge and behavior of the 
homeschooled children rather than their high school diplomas. In 
fact, other things being similar many colleges prefer 
homeschoolers because of the diversity and richness they bring to 
their college life.

Admission requirements may vary. While some colleges require the 
child to appear for the SAT, others may need a general equivalency 
diploma. And some may not care for any tests at all. The criterion 
may vary depending on the college that you wish to apply to. But, 
college courses really do not require any high school background 
or special training. 

It is common to come across parents who frantically try to shift 
out their homeschool children to high schools because they fear 
unavailability of college admissions. But college admissions are 
open to all educated individuals, regardless of whether they are 
educated at home or at a public school.
