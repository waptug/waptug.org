Homeschooling the teenager

As children start maturing into adults, parents feel insecure
about homeschooling. Many parents then discontinue the 
homeschooling process and happily hand over the reign to outside 
authorities. But is this really necessary? Is the strictly 
compartmentalized education provided in schools a better option?

If social concerns are worrying you, look for interest-oriented 
associations, clubs and societies. These offer a lot of support 
for leaders, opportunity for shared experience, and foster a sense 
of belonging. Make up your own group or share this responsibility 
with someone else. Home education support groups provide fantastic 
opportunities to meet your child's needs. This is the best way to 
develop intelligent, self-motivated, healthy and able young 
people. 

If the growing burden of some of the higher level Math or Science 
seems to be beyond you, enlist the help of someone who knows more. 
You can even barter your own services and thus save some money. 
With homeschooling becoming more and more popular, support groups 
will have innumerable resources that help you find the right 
teacher for your child. 

The underlying principle that guides homeschooling is this: any 
child has the innate capacity to grow, develop and achieve its 
full potential. All it needs is the right environment and all the 
right answers. Be there to provide these and think twice before 
you turn over this responsibility to a third party.
