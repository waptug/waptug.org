Homeschooling with a disability

If you feel that your child suffers from a disability that
seriously hampers his ability to stick to a routine, then 
homeschooling is your best choice. The child will be constantly 
under your supervision. But he will be gaining a lot of quality 
education, in spite of his disability. This is rather surprising, 
considering how children with disabilities are stigmatized in 
public schools.

Goal setting is an important part of homeschooling a child with 
disability. Set the number of working hours per week for the 
child. A child with a disability may have his bad days. Structure 
the learning hours according to the needs and interests of the 
child. Use the computer. This way, he will have all the 
necessary information right at his fingertips while staying within 
the confines of his home.

Field trips and other educational activities are just as 
important. Get help from your support group. Visit places of 
interest and interact with other children in the group. Take your 
child out for some activities, so that he can socialize. Let him 
set his own pace with making friends. This will help in 
strengthening his self-esteem.

Above all, remember that homeschooling is just the same, even when 
your child suffers from a disability. You will just need to look 
for the right opportunities and the easiest alternatives to 
achieve the same goals.
