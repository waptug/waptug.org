Homeschooling and the family

According to the National Center For Education Statistics, almost 
1.1 million children underwent homeschooling in 2005 alone. That's 
a lot of children. Once upon a time, homeschooling used to be a 
radical statement - something like a declaration of independence. 
It was the conservative Christians who advocated homeschooling in 
the '80s and legalized it in every State. But the typical 
homeschooler of the day is not religiously motivated.

Recent surveys indicate that parents are actually quite fed up of 
the public school systems where much of the learning is 
superficial and compulsory. They are also concerned about negative 
school environment ranging from drugs and abuse to negative peer 
pressure. As a result, we have a surprising mix of people who form 
the homeschooling world of today. They cut across all religious 
and regional borders. Their main aim is providing meaningful and 
productive learning through a method that strengthens the bond 
between the various members of the family.

All these families have one thing in common - a long enduring 
commitment to the sanctity of childhood. The children in these 
families are accorded a primary position. Many believe, and 
rightly so, that homeschooling allows parents to bring up children 
in a more natural and nurturing environment. Public schools can 
make one nervous, diffident and downright mean. Children who get 
schooled at home are protected from these damaging negative 
influences till they reach an age where they can handle it.

Homeschooling draws the whole family into the almost religious 
task of schooling. Everyone is put to work. The parents together 
form a bond with the children. Any experience can be turned into 
an educational experience. Both the parents are aware of exactly 
what is going into their child's head. Parents also have greater 
control on the kind of religious and moral values that the child 
imbibes. Even watching a movie together can become a learning 
experience. Trips to the libraries and other places become 
educational as well as recreational. 

A homeschooling family is primarily dependent on the income of one 
earning member. That means that often spending has to be curtailed 
and proper planning of expenditure is a must. This helps to bring 
the family members together and everybody gets involved in the 
process of saving money. 

Having a parent at home to supervise, to nurture and care for the 
children brings with it a lot of love and caring. Even your 
husband chips in and there just is no room for boredom. Yes, 
problems do crop up, and there are a lot of misgivings in your 
mind. But when you know that your kids can always count on you, 
and your kids know it too, then homeschooling becomes a richly 
rewarding experience.
