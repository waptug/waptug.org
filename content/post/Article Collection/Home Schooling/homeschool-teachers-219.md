Homeschool teachers

The teacher is the key to the success of homeschooling. In most
cases, the teacher is a parent or a close relative. In some cases, 
parents may divide the subjects between them. Rarely, if both 
parents are busy, they may hire a homeschool teacher. Whatever the 
case, children need time with their parents. Parents, as a rule, 
make very good teachers.

Teaching does not involve a clinical presentation of facts. 
Learning has to be integrated lovingly into daily life for it to 
interest the child. That is where parents come in. Grandparents 
also make great teachers, especially since they have an abundance 
of patience. 

If you feel anxious about your skill or knowledge, relax. There 
are countless homeschooling resources that are aimed at helping 
you. Professional curriculum packages, support groups, online help 
desks, virtual schools and library resources are all available. 
When you start out, you may want to make use of the commercial 
curriculum packages. Readymade software also allows you to record 
and log important achievements.

Local support groups are an excellent source of help, ideas and 
material. This is where you get to meet experienced homeschoolers, 
who will be more than happy to offer their insight and advice. 
Once you settle into the homeschooling routine, you will find 
yourself tailoring the curriculum to suit your own needs.
