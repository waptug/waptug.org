Homeschooling online

If Johnny is fascinated by the blinking cursor and struggles to
master the movements of the mouse, you may want to look into some 
of the recent developments in homeschooling techniques. Gone are 
the days when parents had to buy material from vendors and then 
pass it on to their children with explanations. Today, you get the 
full course details, material and test papers online.

Children love to sit with the computer. In addition to making them 
feel like an adult, the computer also makes use of the visual and 
sound medium to make learning fun and easy. Streaming video and 
audio show various scientific processes in great detail. The 
colorful pictures and the various techniques used help to 
effectively bind the data to the child's memory.

Many online resources have a fun testing center that aims to 
measure the knowledge and skill level of your child. Complicated 
math and science problems are dealt with deftly and elegantly.
A visit to an e-library can also be fun, especially when there 
is an audio clip that reads out the passage to you. 

E-learning has just begun to revolutionize the world of studies. 
If harnessed properly, a child can assimilate an astonishing 
amount of information from that great resource sitting right there 
at your table - your P.C.
