Montessori Homeschooling

Developed from the work of Dr. Maria Montessori, this style of
teaching aims at duplicating natural laws that a child faces in 
life. Thus the aim of the teacher is to control the environment 
and not the child. It was observed that children who are left free 
to interact with their environment developed an innate 
self-discipline, love for order and natural curiosity.

The Montessori method of teaching is especially suitable to the 
preschooler who wants to do everything by himself. Finding ways in 
which your child can participate in the cleaning, washing, 
cooking, gardening and other 'adult' activities sets the perfect 
backdrop for the learning experience. By providing such 
opportunities for independence, the child's self-esteem also gets 
a huge boost.

Artistic, cultural and scientific activities abound in the 
Montessori 3-6 class. There is no TV, junk food, or computer. 
Material is selected carefully. The child is never forced to work. 
Instead he is encouraged to do things that interest him, and the 
teacher picks up the teaching from cues given by the child.  The 
Montessori method focuses on the child's inborn ability to learn 
from his surroundings. Thus the teacher aims to encourage the 
natural curiosity of the child. He is never forced to learn or 
explore. When the child understands why he needs to learn 
something, he will love the learning process.
