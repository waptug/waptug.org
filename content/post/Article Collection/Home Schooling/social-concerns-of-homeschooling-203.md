Social concerns of homeschooling

Social skills is an area of deep concern when it comes to 
homeschooling. Many critics point out that since man needs to hone 
his social skills, a homeschooling environment where social 
interaction is limited is detrimental to his growth and 
development. But studies have proved this wrong.

Children put into the fiercely competitive school environments 
lack the confidence to hold a conversation. Such children show 
little genuine interest in the topic of conversation and don't 
know how to interact with people of various age groups, 
especially their elders. 

Children who learn at home are more aware of the implications and 
the purpose of their learning. They will ask intelligent questions 
and make accurate observations. Children begin their life by 
imitating their parents. Homeschooled children therefore pick
up the sterling qualities they see in their parents. On the other 
hand, they are protected from the detrimental influences of their 
peers.

These children are thus better equipped with the tools necessary 
to face the world. The positive reinforcement that takes place 
in the homeschooling environment as opposed to being abandoned, 
embarrassed or ignored in a normal school environment strengthens 
their self-esteem. Children turn out to be better balanced and
well-rounded as they progress into adulthood.
