Homeschool - Field trips

If you are going over a particular subject with the family and
feel that a field trip would be beneficial, then that's what you 
should do - go for a trip. If you are attached to a support group, 
you can plan to include other children too. 
 
Here are some guidelines that will help you plan:
1) Collect the rates
2) Allowed ages
3) Special highlights
4) Size of the group
5) Timings
6) Eating facilities

Inform your support group of all these details well in advance so 
that the necessary circulars may be sent out. On the appointed 
day, arrange to meet with other parents and children in a 
particular place. Plan the mode of travel and reach the place at 
least 10 minutes in advance. 

The field trip is not just fun. So, let your kids bring their 
writing material. Allow them time to stare and admire. Do not 
hurry them along. Collect data beforehand so that you can clear 
doubts. Get help from a guide, if necessary. And most importantly, 
have fun and enjoy the time you spend with your children.
