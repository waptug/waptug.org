Benefits Of Homeschooling

Why let Tim and Lisa learn at home than send them to school? 
Well, first of all, you don't have to wake them up at 7 every 
morning and bundle them off to school with umpteen numbers of 
instructions, and wait with an anxious heart till they return. 
Homeschooling gives you more control over the influences that 
affect your child. The growth and development of your child 
is removed from the realm of the unknown. You, and you alone 
can decide what your child needs to do or learn. Tailoring 
the curriculum to suit the needs and interests of the child 
is one of the most obvious benefits of homeschooling

Individual attention is another salient benefit of 
homeschooling. For instance, if Lisa needs more time to learn 
Math, then she can reduce the time for her English lessons. 
There are no fixed hours of learning per subject. This means 
that a child has the advantage of assigning more number of 
hours to the subject that seems tough WITHOUT any additional 
pressure. The amount of time needed to learn each subject 
will depend on the abilities and interests of the child. 

The schooling of the child becomes an extended family activity. 
Parents get involved in every step of the learning procedure. 
Field trips and experiments become family activities. Thus, 
the child receives more quality time with his parents. The 
entire family shares games, chores and projects. Family 
closeness becomes the focus here. The child is also free of 
any negative peer pressure while making choices and decisions.

Competition is limited when it comes to homeschooling. The 
child does not need to prove his ability with regards to other 
children. His confidence remains intact. Since parents have a 
deep understanding of their child, they can plan the learning 
program to pique the child's interest. It is also possible to 
intersperse difficult tasks with fun activities. A tough hour 
with Algebra can be followed by a trip to the nearest museum. 
Learning becomes fun. Parents can also tailor the curriculum to 
suit the learning style of the child. Some children learn through 
reading, while others need to write, and still others need to see 
objects in action. 

Homeschooling allows parents to take control over the moral and 
religious learning of the child. Parents have the flexibility to 
incorporate their beliefs and ideologies into the child's curriculum. 
There is no confusion in the child's mind either because there is 
no variation between what is being taught and what is being practiced. 

Lastly, more and more parents are getting disillusioned with the 
public school system. They believe that their children are being 
pushed too hard or too little. Other worrying issues pertaining to 
discipline and ethics also make the school system less welcome. Many 
repudiate the educational philosophy of grouping children solely on 
the basis of their age. Some parents themselves have unhappy memories 
of their own public school experience that motivates them to opt for 
homeschooling when it comes to their own children.  

Homeschooling is the best way to teach a child if you have the time, 
the ability and the interest to follow through with his education. After 
all, nobody can understand or appreciate your child more than yourself.
