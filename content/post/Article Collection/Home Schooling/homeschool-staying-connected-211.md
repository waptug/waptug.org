Homeschool - staying connected

The world has become a jungle of knowledge. Wherever you turn, you
find a new fruit that just has to be passed on to your child. In 
the middle of all the knowledge flying to and fro, we sometimes 
forget to talk and relax with our children. A mom who doubles as a 
teacher needs to leave the teacher behind and simply become mom 
for a few hours everyday.

Listen to your child. Do not just hear the words, but notice the 
emotion too. Many children find it difficult to express exactly 
what they want. Talk to your child about general stuff and allow 
him to be 'just a kid'. When you talk to your child, as for his 
opinions. Few things please him more. It also adds kilos to his 
self-confidence. 

Most parents interrupt when their children talk. We, as adults, 
detest it when someone cuts across our lines. Kids keep mum 
because they are forced to be silent when we shut them up. But 
this is unhealthy and unfair. Allow your child to finish and then 
express your views in a rational manner. The child should have the 
confidence to confide in you.

Gentle parenting is the key to successful homeschooling. Be a 
parent first, and then a teacher.
