Homeschool burnout

When a parent takes on the responsibility of educating his or her
child, homeschool burnout is one of the more common issues they 
have to deal with. There are many reasons that lead to this 
burnout: an illness, a new baby, added responsibility, change in 
routine etc.

The symptoms of burnout vary from lack of patience to overeating 
and crying without any apparent reasons. Surprisingly, a burnout 
need not be such a bad thing. It is a wake-up call - an indicator 
that things are not going well and that you need to reschedule. 
Reversing or avoiding a burnout is possible if you get fair 
warning.

Firstly, lower your expectations. Do not be a perfectionist. Take 
the good days with the bad. Next, when something does not seem to 
work, look for alternative methods. Flexibility is a key 
factor. If tension starts mounting, take a break. When necessary, 
change the style of teaching. For instance, small children love to 
take on their spellings when they quiz an adult. 

Avoid overkill. Do not pack too many activities for the sake of 
socializing your child. A worn out mom means a grouchy kid and 
that means no happiness. Get support from your spouse or a 
neighbor or a support group. Don't try to achieve everything by 
yourself. Homeschooling means 'happy schooling' - don't forget 
that.
