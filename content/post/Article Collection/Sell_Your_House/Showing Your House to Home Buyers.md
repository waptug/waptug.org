Showing Your House to Home Buyers
This is it. The icing to your cake. The moment you’ve been waiting for ever since you decide to sell your home. The price is right, the marketing is going well, and you watch with enthusiasm as the response started coming: the home buyers are coming! It’s now time to take your marketing to the next level: house showings. How are you preparing for it? You’ve inspected, checked and cleaned your house thoroughly. You made sure everything’s in place, or if they’re not, in the most ideal place to be shown. Showings are, after all, the chance to impress the home buyers by flaunting everything your house has. 
Now relax. Showing your house to home buyers is especially easy when you’re trying to sell your own house by yourself. This is a good opportunity to get personal – homebuyers would want to see more than just the house they saw in the advertisement picture. As you move throughout the house, pay special attention to objects that created some memories during your stay. Things like “My father does this beautiful carving when he was 18” will add some personal note to your home. And while you’re on the business of using your family, don’t hesitate to let your family members take part. Assign jobs for them in advance for emergencies or short-notice showings. 
You want the home buyer’s full attention on your house. But at the same time you want some elements on your house to be insignificant enough to provide a comfortable environment. Make sure the house is well aired and lighted by opening windows (during possible weathers) and positioning all the coverings to show maximum sunlight. A dark house, especially when it’s a big house, will create the effect of gloom and depression; not exactly the kind of house you’d buy.
During those times when you’re forced to keep all your windows shut, make sure the air inside your house is in good, clean condition. Some homeowners will bake cookies to keep that “fresh” air hanging, but if you’re not keen on taking it that far, just be sure to wipe out any pet / bathroom odors or smoke. In house showings, the air should do what it needs to do – allows human to breathe – and do nothing more.

Having a pet around is highly discouraged. No matter how well behaved they are, or how much the homebuyers may love them, it’s not a good idea to bring out your animal. God knows what kind of behaviour they can suddenly break into in front of your guests!

Last of all, if an agent is showing your house to home buyers, try as hard as you can not to be at home. Homebuyers tend to feel like intruders when they’re checking details of a house with its owners watching.
