Remember that first impression is an important thing, how can you sell you home fast if your home itself does not look attractive on the web. Generally, if the buyers do not attracted to your home on the web, there will be little chance that they will be willing to see your home. 
Make sure that your home is termite free, and has a good plumbing; water quality, lead, radon, septic tank, asbestos, electricity. You have to make the inside and outside your home is freshen up. After all those things set, you can start to make an “open house”. Open house should be scheduled on the time in which your home shows its best performance or condition. For example, if you have a beautiful garden, show it off during the morning before the flowers start to wilt. If there's one thing that you love most about your home, be sure to share it with potential buyers. 
Selling home fast is not an impossible thing to do. But yet, you still have to spend extra money to hire design interior, home organizer, professional photographers, and other expenses. But those expenses really worthwhile compare to the money that you will get. Hope that you can sell your home quickly.
