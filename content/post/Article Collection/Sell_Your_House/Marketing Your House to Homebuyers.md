Marketing Your House to Homebuyers
When you want to sell your house, it’s essential that you pay special attention on marketing your house to homebuyers. After all, marketing is the way to get people noticing that you’re trying to sell a house!
But for agents, it’s an entirely different deal. On each call generated by a marketing of your house, there is an opportunity for the selling agent to take them as clients. The more calls your house generates, the bigger possibility of the buyer’s agent to get clients.
Although the reason is different, marketing your house to homebuyers will always be a big deal for all aspects of the sellers’ side. You might want to confirm that the agent handling your house advertisement runs ads in magazines and local newspapers for that matter. Prepare the advertisements with well consideration. Pick out a good picture of your house. List the features homebuyers would look for. Also check that your advertisements go to the local Multiple Listing Service, as this is considered the most powerful marketing tool you can find.
If you feel like the agents are not doing a good enough job, put some efforts in marketing your house yourself. Create fliers and postcards announcing your home selling and spread it in the neighborhood. Your neighbors may not want to buy your house, but there’s a chance they know of a homebuyer. And because they already know the environment, they’ll make perfect salesmen for your house! “Word of mouth”, as always, is the most effective step you can take at the cheapest price.
Following the announcements, you might want to set up an open house that doubles as home showings. The bad thing about this is that most visitors of an open house are rarely homebuyers – some of them just followed the “Open House” sign and went in for no reason. But it’s still a good extent for your “word of mouth” campaign. It might even create interests from local real estate agents to list your house. But try not to organize an open house as an alternative when your house has been in the market for some time. Most of your neighbors would already know that you’re marketing your house to homebuyers and the open house would attract even less visitors.
Whether it’s with an agent or by yourself, you would always want to be involved in marketing your house to homebuyers. In home selling you will be competing with thousands of other houses, and who’s better to flaunt the features to homebuyers than the one who’s been living in it?
