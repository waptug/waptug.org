Selling Home
	When you think about selling home maybe you think about to settle all your furniture and anything else in your home. Well it’s quite right but selling home means also to remove all the clutters, to repair all the damages in the house, to decide what price of your home, and to make the advertisement in the newspaper or magazine.
	Selling home needs long preparation and you should do it long time before you want to sell it. You should throw away your emotion with your home and think about it as a marketable commodity. When you selling home the others who want to buy it should think it as their potential new home not yours old home. 
	Next what you should do in selling home is throw away all the clutters in your home. Maybe you’re emotionally attached with some of these clutters and I remind you once more you should throw away your emotion. Think about all clutters in the closets, garage, attic, and basement. You don’t want the buyer come and see some of the clutters in those places. 
	And then you need to repair all the damages when you do selling home. But let me tell you, repair the damages for selling home doesn’t mean you do anything expensive such as remodeling your house. You need to save your money to buy your new home or to obtain new loan. Checking the light, water, closet and toilet is a good point to do for selling home. Do check the floor, wall, ceil, windows and doors when selling home. 
	Maybe the difficult thing to do in selling home is to decide the price of your home. Don’t set your selling price too high when selling home ‘cause you might get difficulty to get buyer. And if you drop your price later it might be too late. Selling home about six month is a long time and if there’s no one who buy your home in this period of time the other buyer may think that you will be desperate and they’ll make a lower offer. So selling home need a wise thinking and deep consideration to set the price of your home. 
	Next thing is to make advertisement about your selling home in the newspaper or magazine. You should make an attractive but not exaggerating ‘cause people might think it doesn’t not make sense if you make advertisement like that. And after you advertise your home and there’s someone who wants to buy your home you should show your home to them. Try not to be home when they come to see your home, take the kids to the nearest park and try to control your pets. Keep the house tidy and throw away the kitchen trash. And in the end your home may be sold with the price like you wanted.
