Home Selling Prices
So you’ve decided to do some home selling. Congratulations, this is an exciting business you’re getting yourself into. Whether it’s selling your parents’ house, your aunts’, your close friend’s, or even your own home, there are some things to consider before you can start marketing the house. One of which is how to set the price. 
It’s really important to take time before you finalize your home selling prices. If the price is too high, the home will stay in the market for too long, waiting for someone who can afford it. Even if you chose to reduce the price later, it would show the potential buyers that even the seller realize that the home selling price was too high (and probably still is). But if the price is too low, this would easily sell but eventually brings damages to the sellers’ net expectation!
If you’re selling your own home, the chances are you’re going to want to set the price as high as possible. This might seem like an obviously silly thing to do, but it happens to a lot of people who either cherish their house too much, or are simply not aware of the real value. 
The first case is a lot easier to handle. Remember that apart from the location, your home selling price is a major consideration in purchasing. So no matter how much you love your house, try to set a realistic price. Some things that might decrease (or increase) your home selling price are as follows:
a.	Location. Sorry, this one’s a definite. A home in a more desirable area will cost more than less desirable ones.
b.	House condition. A good maintenance shows that this home is worth being looked after.
c.	Surroundings. Check out schools around the house and their quality. See how the weather would take effect. Watch those pesky neighbors. These things, though seemingly miscellaneous, applies to buyers and can affect the overall home selling price.
d.	Extra features. Does the house own something the market is demanding? Does your home have a pool or a beautiful patio? Don’t hesitate in taking them into account of setting the price. Be realistic, though – a dusty, never-used fireplace, no matter how classy, will do nothing to your home value.
The second case – where you’re not sure of your house’s value – is a bit more difficult. You might want to read some home selling advertisements to see the price of the houses similar to the one you’re selling. 
To help you finish off with an ideal home selling price, some standardized methods of price setting have been established. A Comparable Market Analysis (CMA) is “a comparison of similar properties in the same general area that compares actual sold prices”, in other words, comparing your house to similar ones to get a rough value. Nowadays Real Estate Agents can do CMA for you, and you can even do it yourself by the help of some websites.
