Quick sell tips
Often wonder why some houses can have a number of showings after its first week on the market, and similar ones seems to be left with no attention? A quick sell of a house is common enough to be expected by home sellers, but rare enough to remain a phenomenon in the market. It’s really a question of readiness – the houses being sold quickly are more well prepared to accept a new resident. Surely price and location is the major reason a house can appeal to home buyers, but there’s also more than meets the buyer’s eye. Here are some quick sell tips to make sure your house reaches that contract as soon as possible.
(a)	Get a top-quality, state-of-the-art real estate agent. Sounds obvious, but the better qualified your agent is, the more experienced they are and the more guarantee that your house can be a quick sell
(b)	Play the role of a buyer. Observe your house in the eye of a potential customer. Is there anything you see that makes you think “This is good, but it looks like they’re still working on that...”? Ask your friends or neighbours to do the same if necessary. 
(c)	There’s one sure-fire tip to get your house quickly noticed, and that’s putting out the heaviest advertising campaign you can manage. So many houses are being sold daily, how do you make sure the buyers would even see your home? Quick selling houses are results of excellent marketing skills.
(d)	Offer incentives. When it’s time to take any means necessary, start negotiating extra perks to your buyers to lure them even more. A closing-cost help, for example, would motivate the buyers to speed up the decision to buying your house. 
(e)	When all else fails, and you’re starting to get really desperate, you might want to try renting your house. Afraid of never getting it off your back? Discuss with the renters that your initial need is to sell the house. A rented house with an option to buy is also a good idea 
Some would tell you that quick sells are by means of luck. Though this is inevitably true, waiting for luck will do nothing to speed up the process. Preparation, preparation, and preparation are the three things you most need to ensure a quick sell.
home selling contract
When it’s time to finally seal the deal on your home selling, it’s time to take out the contract. Since it’s the document that will supposedly ends the process, it’s very important for home owners to understand the components of a real estate contract (even more if you’re selling the house on your own). Remember that even the contents in a contract is negotiable, so getting to know home selling contracts would put you in a better position for further discussion. You would also have less risk of being scammed by random contracts offered. 
Although not all home selling contracts follow the same standard, most of them should answer the following questions:
·	What’s being sold? A description of the property on hand
·	How much is it? 
·	How is the contingency of mortgage? An amount or a mortgage rate is needed.
·	How much will the deposit be and whom will it be given to?
·	When and where is the closing?
·	What is the exact scope of the selling? A home selling contract, in its essence, should give a firm limit of what’s being sold and what’s not.
·	Will the seller be able to do further home inspections?
·	What kind of inspections (wellness, hygiene, termite inspection) will be done?
·	Is there any insurance covering the house?
Once again, remember that familiarizing yourself with these points will prove useful for those suspicious clauses. Pay extra attention to the contingencies, as this is usually the most essential part of a home selling contract. The home buyers would want to make sure that if something occurs in the house before closing, they would have a way to back out without penalty. Make sure that you as the seller is equally unharmed by this.
The tough job is, even after you understand the main elements of a home selling contracts, you might experience difficulty in designing one for your transaction. Once again, it’s good to let your agent deal on these things, but if you’re selling your home on your own, do some research. Some websites could give you a format of a contract that you could use for self-selling that will not lead to detrimental effects. It’s very important to hire an attorney to help you get through the legal terms in contracts, especially when you chose not to hire a real estate agent.
