help selling home
Someone you know is selling a home? Had successful experience in doing so before? For someone who’s never done it, home selling can be frustrating. If you think you can help selling a home, it usually means you’ve had enough satisfaction doing it before, and is willing to do it again. Good for you (and for the confused homeowners). 
So how can you help sell a house? Most home owners will stumble even on the preparation phase – when they have to understand all the legal requirements. You might have known from your experience that getting the legal stuff straight is the first step of a home selling process, so an assistance on this would always be appreciated. You can help the owners understand difficult clauses in documents, or design the wordings in their contract forms. 
Not keen on paperwork? Help advertising. See if you know anyone who’s looking for a house. If you have some potential buyers, think about who would fit better to the house. The good thing about having a “personal home salesman” is that it knows more than just facts about the house. Think about the neighbourhood, the size of the house, and the climate, and find someone who might be interested in the qualifications. Or if you work in a newspaper or magazine, you can help by posting up the advertisement. 
Of course, the concept “helping to sell a home” also applies when you’re selling your own house with the help of an agent. If you want to improve the home selling process, there are some independent steps you can do. Spread out the news that you’re selling your home in the neighbourhood. Organize open houses to invite visitors. Provide your agent with complete information about your house. Put up extra advertisements where your agent may not cover; a blog or personal website is excellent for this. Some people are reluctant to help their agents selling their home on the reason of “that’s what they’re paid for!”. Remember that agents have a lot more clients to handle and may not always focus their attention on your house. The home owner is the only one who’s willing to voluntarily give out complete information to potential buyers at no cost! Also keep in mind that no matter how great an agent you have, if your house has been in the market for a long time, you are going to be the person most financially damaged. 
Whether it’s helping sell someone’s house, or an agent selling your own home, an assistance in home selling is always needed. Homes are such large investments – one simply can not sell it alone.
