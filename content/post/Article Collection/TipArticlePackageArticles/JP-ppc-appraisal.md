PPC Appraisal Program:  Leave Your Computer On And Earn Money

This program is very simple to download, entirely free and really works! 

Requiring no sponsoring, no costs at all to join, once it has been set up, the only thing you do is leave your computer on and the system will just automatically run and you can trace your income by the second.

This program operates comparable to “click on a search engine and get paid” programs, with the exception of the following:

1.	It is run automatically similar to auto surf, so there is no need for you to click on any link.

2.	It does not provide you with only one search engine, but there are at least twenty one now running.

If you continually run your computer for twenty four hours a day, you may earn up to fifteen dollars a day.  At the end of the month, when they will be adding up to two hundred more search engines, you may earn up to sixty dollars a day, not doing anything, just be online.

In addition, you get another five percent of your referrals running time; these referrals could go as far as four levels.

Every search engine builds up an independent total of your time surfing.  You must reach sixty dollars before payment be done by each of the search engine.

Normally, when you are running your computer online for twenty four hours each day, without any referral, for you to reach sixty dollars, it would more or less take you up to two months, with the now running twenty four search engines.  Now consider this, sixty multiplied by twenty four will equal to one thousand four hundred forty.  This is how much you will make in two months, of doing nothing.
