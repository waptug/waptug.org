What is landscaping rock?

Not only is there a find collection of colors of landscaping rock there is also several different kinds of stone to choose from. Different landscaping designs will require different landscaping rock. You can get small landscaping rock or larger landscaping rock. 

The trick to using landscaping rock successfully is to fully integrate them into your yard and the design. You need to place them in places that will add to the yard, not in places that will make it look like you are trying to cover something up or take attention away from another part of the yard. If you were to just put your landscaping rock here and there you will be doing nothing for the yard and your yard will end up looking strange and unbalanced. You should plan exactly where each landscaping rock should be placed for the ultimate good effect. 

If you take the time to bury your rock it will look much better. This will make them look planted and they will blend in and look as if this is where they really should be, not just where they got clunked down. 

How far should you bury your roc in the ground? The depth will all depend upon the landscaping rock that you finally choose fro your yard. If you choose a very large landscaping rock then it should be deeper than a smaller landscaping rock. Four to six inches is a good depth for your landscaping rock to be buried. 

It is easy to build a landscaping rock. All you need to do is dig a spot about the size of your landscaping rock and them place the rock into it. You can then just tuck some dirt into the spot around the rock and then you are done. Voila! 

Think about it, this is what rocks and boulders look like when you see them out in nature. The next time that you are out taking a walk or you are hiking keep an eye out for any large rocks, look at how they sit in the dirt and then try to get the landscaping rock in your yard to look just as natural.
