Gardening books come in all different shapes and sizes and offer more information on gardening than can be found anywhere else.  Anything anyone ever wanted to know about gardening can be found in a gardening book.  Gardening books are not expensive, and will end up being worth much more than you will pay for one.  Not only can gardening books be used for personal use, they are also an excellent gift for a gardening friend.

For the beginner, gardening books are almost a necessity in starting a garden.  Books will give step-by-step instructions and easy to understand directions on how to plant a garden, from breaking up the dirt to how much water your plants need.  They will give all of the necessary details about every type of plant, such as how much light they need to survive, how often they need to be watered, how much nutrients must be added to the soil, and any other little quirks that plants have.

Gardening books are very informational and range anywhere from just a pamphlet size book with a few pages to a novel size book with hundreds of pages.  The information provided is top notch and a lot of it cannot be found anywhere else.  Books provide hints and tips on how to make your plants healthier, how to keep your garden free of weeds, and how to prevent against and fight diseases.

Often times gardening books will give readers ideas they had never thought of before.  For example, there are hundreds of vegetables and herbs out there that many people would never think of growing in their backyard, but would be very good to grow in your own personal garden.  There are also millions of flowers many people don’t think about but that are very beautiful.  There are hundreds of people that would probably trade their rose bush for an exotic flower, and with a gardening book they could read about what types of flowers are available and will grow in their area.

Whether you enjoy gardening or not, gardening books are wonderful gifts if you have a gardening friend.  It is personalized and you can give a great gift that isn’t that expensive.  You could even give it to someone who doesn’t garden.  Who knows, maybe they will be interested and decide to plant a garden.

Gardening books are excellent for any type of gardener at any level.  No matter how much gardening knowledge and experience you have, I guarantee you there is a gardening book somewhere that has something in it you don’t know.  Gardening books can be used no matter what you grow: shrubs, flowers, vegetables, fruits, and trees, even those of you who grow weeds!
