    Gardening Gift

Gardening has become one of the most popular hobbies, and you probably know a gardener or two that would love a gardening gift for their upcoming special occasion.  There are hundreds of gardening gifts to buy for both the beginner and expert gardener, and the great thing about gardening gifts is they can be bought just about anywhere: online, nursery, feed store, farmer’s market, even your local Wal-Mart or grocery store.

If buying a gardening gift for a beginner, an instructional or informational book is always a good idea.  Books like this will give tips on how to eliminate gardening nightmares like disease, insects, and weeds.  They will tell gardeners which kind of plants thrive in different climates, as well as how much sun, water, and nutrients various types of plants require.  Books like this can be purchased at nurseries, online, or at your local bookstore.  If your gardening friend is a “computer nerd”, a gardening information CD might be a better gardening gift for them than a book.

Whether giving to a novice or expert professional, a plant is always a great gardening gift.  Whether buying the traditional gift, like a poinsettia at Christmas, or just some random plant random, like moss, a plant is sure to be greatly appreciated and enjoyed.  Another idea is to buy seeds or just a bulb for someone to transplant.  Giving a perennial would be a gift that keeps on giving.  

Theme gardening gifts using plants can also be loads of fun.  An herb can come with an attached card including a recipe using that herb.  A plant that produces nectar and will attract butterflies can be coupled with a book on butterflies.

Possibly the best and most common, gardening gift is gardening tools.  This can be anything as simple as a hoe or rake to something more high-tech like an electric blower or vacuum.  These are good for removing debris, leaves, or grass from driveways and side walks.  Other favorites are gloves, hedge trimmers, and sprinklers.

An excellent gardening gift that is rarely though of is a calendar.  Calendar’s can serve dual purposes; it can be decorative with beautiful gardening themes, or can be used to keep up with the moon phase that affects most all plants.  A farmer’s almanac is also a good idea, it is full of information regarding the weather, moon phase, when to plant, when to prune; it is the best guidebook to gardening there is.

The ultimate gardening gift is for any gardener is a gift certificate to a nursery or store where gardening tools or plants are available.  This way, your friend can get any tool they do not have in their collection, or any kind of plant their heart desires.

Gift giving is a difficult task at best, but if you have gardeners for friends, a gardening gift is an easy way out and makes your gift buying simple.  Gardening gifts can range anywhere from tools to actual plants and with gardening gifts you have a wide range of costs to choose from.  You can give a cheap pair of gloves or an expensive power tiller.  So the next time you go gift shopping, thing about a gardening gift for your friends with green thumbs!
