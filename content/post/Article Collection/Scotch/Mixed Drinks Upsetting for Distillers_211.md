Mixed Drinks Upsetting for Distillers

Although some Scots are softening up in regards to their traditional dram, we cannot say all of them are. Some are indeed abusively screaming and kicking, with regard to how their fine brew is handled.

The idea of mixing a fine scotch in a fancy drink at the bar seems preposterous. This notion is dubbed an act of kindness, yet not too kind to the distillers that have toiled to bring us such a wonderful product.

Scotch is a wonderful brew that hit the mainstream of the U.S. in the early 1990â€™s.  Several have considered this type of drink as a personality definer, causing it to grow quickly in popularity.  Through Scotch as a drink was also a growing interest in it as a single malt treat.  However, there are many different variations that have hit the market in order to please every palette.

It has been said that scotch is a nasty old bugger who is drank alone or with one or two close friends and not in the spirit of socializing. However the distillers, and aficionados alike tend to disagree. They feel that the time spent with friends and family, should indeed include the sipping of a fine scotch, for pleasure and conversation alike.
