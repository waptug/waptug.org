Global whiskeys

Scotland is not the only country that can put out a quality scotch product.  Many countries have ventured into the spirits domain. Canada is one of them. The Canadian whiskeys are starting to shine with products that are crisp and bold to the taste buds. 

Following strict compliance with Canadian regulations these spirits are distilled and bottled no less than two years before consumption. Usually the bottling is done no sooner than six years and many are much longer than that now.

They are not noted as straight whiskies as they are blended.  They are bold and lightly flavored yet manage to keep a very distinctive body and character. The Canadian government carries out rigid control of the Excise Tax and labeling.

There have been no stipulations in place for the grain formulas or distilling processes.  Nor have the maturing factors or time frames been ruled or governed. They have left it up to the producers of this product to determine what markets abroad and at home desire from their product.  It has been shown that this was a wise decision as the Canadian makers seem to be holding strong in all markets and fields.

Not unlike the brands found in the United States the distillery function is pretty much a standard deal with the exception of the use of cereal grains and some trade secrets. Since Canadian distillers are not faced with artificial proof restriction in their distillation procedures, they are able to operate continuous distillation systems under conditions that are optimum for the separation and selection of desirable congeners.

The relationship between beverage spirits and the congeners is in no way marred while in the fermentation mash solution. The casks are made of white oak and are rated in US gallons matured cooperage insures compatibility of the fine whiskies.  The delicate flavor and per portions that the maturing batches cooperage is a fine trade secret.

It was spelled out with Sir Joseph Seagram.  He decided in 1911 that an appropriate whiskey should be made for the wedding of his son. This blend became known as Seagramâ€™s V.O or very own whiskey as it is known in those parts. Only pedigree grains and the finest of spring water were and still are used today to create this wonderful and bold whiskey.

The master blender has at his disposal over 2,000 choice and premium flavored bases that he can choose from for his secret and delightful blends.
