The Certified Scotch Malt Bar:  Worth the Trip

An establishment that is spending the time and using funds to maintain after qualifications for a Doc certified scotch malt single bar that carries a distinction is definitely a wonderful place. Just how wonderful is it?

 It seems that the options are endless for novice malt drinker’s right up to the aficionados to have the truest sample of what the Spirit Gods intended. A place to conjure for this treat is surely something to be revered and in all accounts worthy of an award of this stature.

Every couple of weeks a new nectar seems to be hitting the market and this will definitely confuse the new malt sipper yet will send the old time connoisseurs into fits of glee all the while preserving single malt’s status as the true nobleman among spirits. Of course not all follow this robed king of beverage but it does have a strong standing.

Oddly enough they say that the taste of fine single malt an be influenced by the environment you sip in that is subjective at best as the finest single malt will always taste like the finest single malt.

It is extremely important that the tender at the bar know what he is talking about when it comes to giving you what you want or in many cases what he can suggest.  Most aficionados are not unintelligent and have been around the malt block a few times.  An award worthy bar would surely have someone at the helm whom knows the ins and outs of fine single malt and is ready, willing and able to give sound advice and help the newcomers feel at home.  

To these engaging individuals that enjoy this spirit, hearing of a malt pounding fest at the local frat house or biker bar is an arrow to the heart. This is not a drink to become inebriated on instead it is a testament to absolute fine distilling craftsmanship.

To appreciate the subtle character differences in regional malts of Scotland is not for the impatient as there are many blends and malts to be had. If you have the time and are seeking the sheer enjoyment of this spirit you should find your own bar that is Doc certified to sell the select brands of fine scotch single malts; as an establishment such as this is worth its weight in gold.
