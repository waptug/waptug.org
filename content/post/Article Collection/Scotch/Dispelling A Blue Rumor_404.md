Dispelling A Blue Rumor

It has been rumored that the Johnny Walker Blue Label blended whiskey was about to be halted for reasons unknown. This rumor is indeed just that nothing more than a rumor. Here you will find some background on this fine product in the event you wish to try it someday.

Although lately the market place is seemingly chomping at the bit to get a hold of some of this Blue label Johnny Walker ultra premium fine blended whiskey, it has managed to remain elusive to most sippers of fine spirits.

This blend was to be made to celebrate Sir John Walkerâ€™s existence of 200 years.  A blending of young grains and malts make this drink a little mellower.  Like some of the older whiskies, this blend was to be reminiscent of the blends back in the earlier 19th century.

The blue label product does not show an aging date on the label; however this is by no means an indication of poor quality.  In fact, it is quite the contrary.  It has actually been said that there are approximately 16-18 different aged whiskies and single malt blends in one bottle of Johnny Walker blue label.  No one really knows the youngest of these.

The answer to the question of whether Blue Label is going to be discontinued, is simply, no.  They have no intention on discontinuing the blue label Johnny Walker.  It may have not have had the publicity that the other two colors have enjoyed but do not mistake this color for a slouch.

This blend is by all means the Rolls Royce of the current Walker line up at a pretty $200 a bottle.  Single malts can indeed sell out and replenishment of stock is not a short order since the time it takes to mature is lengthy.  However wonderful blends such as the blue label can always be adjusted according to available stock.  

The over abundance of malt stock will keep the blenders busy for quite some time.  Stock will not just deplete overnight. It is a continual cycle where as young and budding malts become old and wise to be replaced with new fillings.

There is no doubt that rare fine scotch will be a continual operation in Scotland and where this comes into play is the continual stock received by the Johnny Walker name. This wonderfully blended product is not under any circumstances going anywhere..
