A Manly Drink

When you think of a man’s drink, what comes to mind? Baileys? Vodka?  To many, scotch seems to be the drink of choice for grown men and seemingly this choice has been made for many, many years. There is most probably not a spirit, more endeared by men than scotch.

Scotch is made here in America, but the finest scotch is made in the Isles of Scotland.  Scotch from Islay Scotland, can cost you a pretty penny.  The scotch mentioned here from Scotland is from the Bruichladdich distillery in Islay Scotland, which is at the most southern of all Hebridian islands. The scotch made there is so rare that it can only be purchased at the distillery.  

Here in America, scotch is not so hard to come by.  A bottle of Wild Turkey costs, on average, about $22.00.  Whereas a high end whiskey can cost up to $50.00 a bottle.  Compare that to a fine scotch from is isles at around $120.00 per bottle and you will see the difference isn’t so much in the bottle, but in the spirit itself.
