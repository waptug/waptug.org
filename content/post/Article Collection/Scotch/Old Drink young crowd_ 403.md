Old Drink, Young Crowd

Why is it that scotch always seem to be left alone in the bar scene? It is understandable that most people find scotch to harsh to drink while dancing the night away but could it not be introduced in some mild cocktails? Generally it is assumed that the sweeter drinks tend to give you the staying power on the dance floor as it is usually loaded with sugar.

Sugar is not an ingredient that one would associate with scotch and many of the clubbers will shy away from the so called old mans drink.  Yet they really do not understand the potential that scotch in small doses in sweet drinks can have.  It can liven up the party in a relatively short amount of time.

Of course there are the few drinks out there that may inspire a look into by the up and coming yuppies that are trying to mature. One of these mild scotch drinks is the Rusty Nail. This wonderful drink contains 1 ½ oz of scotch ½ oz of Drambuie
And a twist of peel from a lemon

This drink forgoes the common rule of no ice with your scotch, as the glass should be filled almost to the brim with cubes. Then the Drambuie and scotch are poured in together stirred vigorously and garnished with the peel. This makes a delightful small mixed drink that is much easier on the throat as well as the stomach that straight scotch.

Another popular drink is the whiskey sour.  This drink is open to enjoyment by all classes and generations. This drink contains 2 oz of blended whiskey, the juice of half a lemon, ½ tsp of powdered sugar, one cherry and half slice of lemon.

Again this drink is easy to make.  Shake the blended whiskey, the powdered sugar and the lemon juice with ice then strain into a whiskey sour glass.  Lastly, top with the cherry and garnish the drink with the lemon slice.

 Another great drink that the younger crowd may enjoy is the Rob Roy.  This is a very simple drink that is relished by many and is very short on the prep time so you can be back on the dance floor in no time flat.

This drink contains 1 ½ oz of scotch whiskey and ¾ oz sweet vermouth. You merely stir contents with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.
