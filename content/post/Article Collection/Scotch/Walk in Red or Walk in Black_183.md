Walk in Red or Walk in Black

In the year 1820 sir John Walker had a vision. To create one of the finest single malt blends the world has ever known. Enter the 2006 trend and apparently his vision turned to gold, as it is the most consumed scotch in the world. At over 120 million bottle sold annually, it is estimated that four bottles per second are enjoyed in 200 countries around the world.

So what color do you walk with? That is a matter of personal taste. You can go with the vibrant blend of the red label, which tends to be the most common for everyday celebrations. Or choose the complex and deeply mellow black label, used throughout time as experience malt.

The choice is yours as both are a wonderful scotch whiskey and will prove to be enjoyable whatever the toast.  If the moment proves to be one that you will want to remember for a lifetime, try the rare and expensive blue label scotch.  

No matter which Walker you walk with surely you will not be let down.
