10-12: Scotch is Getting Younger.

The notion that all scotch must be at least 12 years to be enjoyed is a common understanding among scotch drinkers everywhere.  However, one company is out to prove them wrong.  This scotch is just two years shy of the twelve year mark, but is growing in popularity.  

Enter Glenkinchie; this ten year old malt is 86 proof and a very pale gold in color. It has a reminiscent fragrance of peat and a grassy meadow that ends rather sweet.  Its body is light to medium, it is considered to be well-rounded lowland malt. In the end it stays dry, and carries a hint if ginger. 

Originally formed in 1837 by a farmer, this malt clearly has some history. The original owner of the distillery sold it to another farmer who used the distillery as a cattle shed and sawmill. This property was again sold in 1880 and returned back to its natural intention to make fine malt just in time for the whiskey boom in the 1890â€™s.

This single malt will be enjoyed by the new and revered by the old single malt enthusiasts.
