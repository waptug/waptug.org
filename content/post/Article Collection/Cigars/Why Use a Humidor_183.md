Why Use a Humidor?

If you are not an experienced cigar smoker, you may be wondering why cigar aficionados use humidors.  Humidors are used to store and protect cigars so that they are kept at their peak flavor.  A humidor works by keeping a cigar at a constant temperature, somewhere between 68 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and about 70-72% humidity. 

Many cigar aficionados claim that the ideal temperature for storing cigars is 70 degree F.  Any lower will tend to age the cigar, rather than keep it at a constant level.  Humidors are not meant to age, but rather to preserve the integrity, flavor, and color of the cigar.  

What should you look for when purchasing a humidor?  The good humidor should close completely, with a tight fitting lid that will keep the cigars well kept from the elements and prevent any exchange of moisture.  Seams should be smooth and well fitted for cigars.  Cedar, especially Spanish cedar is ideal for the interior of the humidor.  Of course, make certain your brand of cigars fits well into any humidor you are considering purchasing.
