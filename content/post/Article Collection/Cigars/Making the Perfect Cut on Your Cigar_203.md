Making the Perfect Cut on Your Cigar

How to clip a cigar properly?  Although every cigar aficionado has their own proven method, here are some basic guidelines to get you started.  

First, examine the head, or closed end, of the cigar.  This is the part of the cigar that will need to be clipped.  Determine where the 'cap' is.  The cap refers to the part of the cigar where the tobacco leaf was used to close the cigar.  Once you've found the cap, determine its length.  As a general rule, you should not cut any further than the end of the cap.  If you cut further than the cap, there's a good chance your cigar will unravel!

Use a good quality clipper to cut the head at the cap.  You don't want a cheap cutter that will result in frayed or split cuts.  You can purchase a special cigar cutter at your local tobacco shop that is designed to make clean cuts.  Once you have your cutter, hold your cigar at eye level and make a fast and decisive cut just above the cap.  Less is more when cuttingâ€”if you find your cut is too superficial, simply cut down a bit more.
