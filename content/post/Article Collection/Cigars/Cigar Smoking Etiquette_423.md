Cigar Smoking Etiquette

Smoking cigars may be a great source of pleasure in your life, but the courteous smoker knows that not everyone enjoys the taste (or smell!) of a good Cuban.  With the fervor of anti-smoking campaigns still in full swing, the importance of enjoying a good stogie while not offending others cannot be stressed enough.  Simply remember that while you are smoking a cigar, it can be difficult to gauge the smell that others are experiencing.  And don't forget that cigar smokes can leave a mighty strong residue on clothing, furniture, and even the walls!  In order to enjoy your stogie without a heavy conscience, learn to become a considerate and courteous cigar smoker.

If you live with non-smokers, try to find a well-ventilated area of your residence where you can smoke comfortably.  Although it may be tempting to lock yourself away in an office or bedroom, it's probably not a good idea to smoke in an enclosed area unless it has a window.  Make sure you have easy access to the window.  Never smoke in a closed area!  You are more likely to inhale the toxic air from your own cigar.  If possible, go outside to smoke.  Pull up a lawn chair; relax on the porch, or any other open area where you can smoke comfortably.  Get as far away as possible to non-smokers, especially children and the elderly.  Remember that cigar smoke contains many carcinogens that can be easily inhaled by non-smokers. 

If you must smoke a cigar outside your home, remember that the courteous and respectful smoker will only light up where legally permitted.  Do no light up in a bar, hotel, or restaurant where smoking is clearly prohibited.  The courteous cigar smoker will also make sure to smoke in the company of other smokers.  If you are with someone who does not smoke, ask his or her permission.  If they agree, be considerate about it.  Make sure the smoke isn't wafting in their direction.  Sit near an open window or space.  Make sure the air conditioner or current is moving the smoke in their direction!  Also, make sure no one around you is eating.  The secondhand smoke from a discourteous smoker is a surefire way to ruin a meal.  

A courteous cigar smoker will also be aware of their ashes.  If you must smoke outside your home, make certain to dispose of your ashes in a safe and appropriate container.  Don't forget that ashes can easily blow away, especially in lower quality cigars.  Don't litter with ashes, and be careful they don't blow near anyone around you.
