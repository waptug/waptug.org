Old vs. New:  Choosing the Right Cigar

Are you confused about old cigars versus fresh cigars?  What does this mean, exactly?  If you're new to the world of cigar smoking, these terms can be a little perplexing.  Basically, know that cigars are never really fresh.  That is, you generally can't purchase a cigar just after it has been produced.  Most tobacconists store their cigars at the proper temperature and humidity before they are stored.  Also, the tobacco in most premium cigars is usually aged for about one to two years before it is rolled into a cigar.  

Many smokers prefer old or vintage cigars.  Why?  Older cigars are not inherently better than newer cigars.  This is simply a matter of personal taste and preference.  How long can vintage cigars last before they lose flavor and integrity?  Cigars that are properly stored at a constant temperature of approximately 70 degrees, and about 70% humidity, can be stored indefinitely.  

What happens if an old cigar is not stored properly, and begins to dry out?  Although the integrity of the cigar will probably be damaged, it can be restored significantly by re-humidifying it.  This process must be done slowly and with great care to restore the cigar's flavor and consistency
