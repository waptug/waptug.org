How to Choose the Perfect Single

Wondering how to choose the perfect cigar?  If you're a newcomer to the world of cigar smoking, here are a few tips to choosing the best cigar.

First, note the texture of the cigar. Squeeze it gently. Is very soft, or rigid?  Ideally, the cigar should give slightly, but not too much.  Very gently, squeeze the length of the cigar to check for lumps.  A good cigar will have a consistent texture.

Next, inspect the cigar for flaws.  Any cracks or discolorations are the signs of a lower quality cigar.  The cigar's wrapper should be wrapped smoothly.  

Finally, look at the ends of the cigar.  Pay particular attention to the exposed end where cigar is lit.  If you're new to cigars, it can be difficult to gauge the quality of the tobacco.  The simplest way to judge the tobacco quality of a cigar is to inspect the color of the tobacco.  If you note any abrupt color changes, this may indicate that the tobacco leaves were not laid out properly.  Look for a cigar with a smooth blend of tobacco.
