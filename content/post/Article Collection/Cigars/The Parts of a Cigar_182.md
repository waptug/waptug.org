The Parts of a Cigar

What are the different parts of a cigar?  Many long-time smokers enjoy their stogies without learning the basic parts of their cigar.  While it's true that you can enjoy a cigar without knowing how it was put together, learning the basic parts of a cigar can be instrumental in helping you choose the best quality cigars.

The first thing many smokers notice about a cigar is the wrapper, the layer of tobacco on the outside of a cigar.  A cigar's wrapper is very important because it provides much of the flavor of the cigar.  The best quality tobacco leaves are usually used to construct the wrapper.  They range in color from very clear (claro) to very dark (oscuro).  

Binders are known as the 'intermediate leaves.'  They are used to hold the tobacco filler together.  Binders can vary considerably.  

Last but certainly not least is the filler used to make a cigar.  The filler is the tobacco.  Generally, filler can be either long or short.  Long filler consists of whole tobacco leaves, while short filler consists of scraps.
