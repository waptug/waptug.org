"How to be Invited for Interviews"

Once the application has been sent and the resume received the next thing that should happen is that the employer will be calling to test communication skills by means of an interview.  Allowing yourself to be given the option on which employer is best fitting the applicant is one characteristic of being pro-active.  Consider being called by multiple employers for a job interview in a day a good sign.  This means that they were really impressed with the documents you submitted, therefore, deserving a personal communication on how most likely an applicant would land the job.

Resumes can present an individual very well.  Seventy-five per cent of employers say that applicants with resumes passing their standards would definitely be invited for a job interview.  Allow two or more interviews.  How?  Here are some resumes tips that would give you not only one but more calls for interview:

1. The position that an applicant is interested in should be placed right at the start of the resume.  Having this as an objective shows that an applicant is really focused and career oriented tells that he or she knows what is exactly the perfect career for him or her.

2. One of the best significant ways to get the employers' attention is by using words that are really powerful that denotes strong capabilities of the applicant.  An example of this is, instead of writing, "assigned to be", write instead "in-charge of," indicating that the applicant has active leadership skills that can be a step to the management position if there is any.

3. A bullet catches the eye of an employer at one look.  Use these in itemizing achievements, career highlights, recognition, qualifications, and skills and interests.  Words in bullet form forces the employer to read the information provided.  These also create more clear space on the paper making the application form or the resume very neat and outstanding.

4. Make sure that the resume is very selective.  Only apply for a certain position in one company or organization one at a time.  Do not submit resumes with different job interests and positions applied for at one time.  This will be a complete waste of time.

5. Ask a pro.  Resumes are written with the help of experts who can actually see the applicant's strengths and opportunities. 

Aside from preparing an impressive resume carefully follow and read all the special instructions like how many spaces are provided for a specific answer or the number of words for the answer.  Keep in mind that this is also a test to see how well an applicant can follow simple rules.  Not only does it have to follow the steps, the application form should also be neat.  Handwriting is also being considered and using a black pen will greatly add to the formality of the answer.  As much as possible, never use a liquid paper or fold and bend the application form and paper.

When answering, be careful not to leave blanks unless it really does not apply.  Use N/A only if necessary.  Be truthful with all the answers but this does not mean that you have to provide a complete or thorough answer for every question.  Always adapt the answers to the job being applied for.  Only provide the skills and recognition received that will be beneficial to the new company or employer.  However, see to it that the answers provided indicate the reason of being more qualified than the other applicants.

Choose references that can provide the applicant an objective description and information.  Teachers, friends, and previous employers can be willing and honest enough to provide that information.  The application form must be consistent with the resume.
