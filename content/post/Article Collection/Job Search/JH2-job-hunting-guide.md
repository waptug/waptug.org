Stress-free Job Hunting Guide


Hunting for the perfect job for an individual requires time, effort and knowledge.  

For stress free job-hunting, every individual must first consider the following pointers before starting your job hunting process:

1. Know what type of job you would like to apply for.   Gate crashing job fairs that offer work not related to one's degree or work preference would be a waste of time.

Consider your interests, preference of work location and job shifts (to be especially considered by professionals who have family members to take care of).  If all these fit the category of the job opening available, it would be best to proceed with the application process.

2. Prepare possible needed documents or career portfolio.  Have several copies of your resume, transcript of records and any certifications ready for immediate submission if needed.

3. Know where to look for job postings.  There are various forms that offer listing of jobs.   Below are some of these sites:

3.1 Internet. One of most widely used searching options is the Internet.  Aside from the fact that browsing the Internet for available jobs is less time consuming than personal appearances to inquire at the offices, this can also be the least expensive form of job hunting.

You would not need to buy newspapers to browse through the ads for vacancies nor spend gas money to go to the offices.

Not only local or national vacancies can be browsed through the net, international job openings could likewise be easily accessed by the user, thus, offering one a much wider perspective in choosing the right job.

3.2 Newspapers.  One of the most commonly used searching medium.  Local newspapers advertise jobs that are within an applicant's commuting distance.  Available jobs are usually printed on a regular basis.

3.3 Career or Job Centers.  These usually offer jobs for ages 16-18 and rarely above 21 years of age.  Though fully loaded with vacancies, it caters mostly to the younger applicants.

Job listings are frequently updated; therefore regular visits would ensure the applicants of new job postings.

3.4 Periodicals or magazines.  Professionals are best advised to look for jobs on magazines since employers that would want to hire the same would advertise on such journals.

3.5 Offices.  Most offices have postings of job openings on their Vacancy Boards.  Applicants may directly go to the office to look for vacancies and then directly submit the resume or other pertinent documents to the respective division that receives such documents.
