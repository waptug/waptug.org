Job Descriptions: Why Effective Job Descriptions Make Good Business Sense 

Most neophyte workers or even freshly graduated members of the workforce will jump into jobs without knowing their job descriptions. This practice is understandable. Many of these fresh graduates are just glad to have gotten a job and will try to avoid being to nosy or pushy when it comes to work. They may think that ‘demanding’ a job description will be an added negative to their employer’s impression of them.

This could not be more wrong. Employers, in general, delight in employees that ask about their job description. This shows that the employee has an interest in knowing the specifics of his or her job and would like to know what his or her specific responsibilities are. Here are a few other reasons why job descriptions are truly important to employees and even to those who are searching for jobs.

1. Knowledge of Duties
A job description will furnish you with a list of your responsibilities and duties. This will ensure that you know what jobs you are supposed to do and which jobs you are not supposed to do.  Just “guessing” is not an option. However, you may be trying to do your best doing jobs that are not your duty and responsibility to perform. The result of which, on paper, is that you are not doing your job. 

If you end up doing jobs that are not in your job description. You will not be credited with those jobs. 

2. Prevent Being Taken Advantage Of
There will be instances when as an employee you will be asked to do specific duties that are not in your job description. It is perfectly legal to point to your job description and say that the particular job does not fall under your job description. You will, of course, have to do this politely. 

You may, of course, choose to do these duties. However, make it clear that what you are doing is not within your job description. You and your manager may then choose to talk about whether these duties should be included and the proper remuneration for such.

3. What Matters to Your Employer is Paper
There have been countless employees who have come forth saying, “we did our best, worked over time, and gave our all, but did not receive the proper acknowledgement.” Unfortunately, employers will be too busy to keep track of your performance. You may have to submit reports on your progress and performance. This, of course, should be based on your job description or else it will not make any sense to your employer.
