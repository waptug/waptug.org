Better Job Search Engines

Job search engines use state-of-the-art technology to assist people in their job quest.  Here you could enter all the relevant information to reduce the lists of sought after jobs to get more accurate results.

Because new jobs are being added daily or even hours after, the tendency to see the results you had yesterday may be different from what you see today.  This is where job search engines come in handy.

After some trial and error there are a few job search engines that could yield better results.  They allow searchers to see major job sites, companies and even its associations by entering a keyword and location.  Results can be seen in different ways, it could be in a browser list and some sent thru e-mail.  

SimplyHired.com, America's Job Bank, Jobster, and Indeed.com are just a few of the search engines that can give you more accurate results.  These sites include over 500 job listings with job boards, prime newspapers, and numerous companies with career pages.  

Indeed.com even has an advance search option that could be used to search company names, positions, and even the distance for commuters.

America's Job Bank let's you enter the job category you would like to search, then you can enter either the city or the zip code and state you would like to find the job and it gives the list of job openings.  If you're lucky, you can even get the quoted salary from each of the companies you're eyeing on.  

In SimplyHired.com aside from the list of jobs open, applicants are also given a short description of the job you're about to handle including the responsibilities to be met even during application.  It also includes the type of company, location and date when the job was posted.

Jobster provides the latest job postings from today up to the last 7 days wherein you can also choose the distance you prefer.  This site gives you the ability to see the list of the freshly posted jobs from a variety of sources.

How Well Are They?

These sites give listings that are relevant and timely, compared to other search engines that generate results a little longer than the others.  Some would even provide results that are far from the location picked out.

So far the best among the search engines used is the Simplyhired.Com.  It showed the job title, a link was also provided for posting, a summary of the job description, where the exact current location and where it originated.  The produced results are easy to read, non-confusing with bits and pieces more of information plus the getting around is user friendly
