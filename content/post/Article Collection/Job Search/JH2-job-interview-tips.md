Tips in a Job Interview


The second step in getting the job is meeting the potential employer for an interview. The first step that an applicant has successfully completed was sending your application and passing the screening process of the company. 

The employer got the resume through a variety of sources that can be from an ad that was posted, a referral from a friend or a headhunter, or by a person who simply submitted an application by logging on the company’s website.  

Here are a few tips that will help in having a successful interview;

•	Before going to an interview, it is best to do some research about the company one is applying to. 

•	It is also best to practice with a friend or family member mock up questions that the employer will likely ask so you do not choke during the real interview.

•	When you go for an interview, it is best to always arrive 10 to 15 minutes ahead of time. This shows employers that the person is punctual and serves as a good attribute in a potential employee.

•	When meeting an employer, you should bring an extra copy of the resume and other documents that are needed if asked certain questions. A good example is architects and photographers who are professionals in the respective fields who have a portfolio of the works done which may impress the interviewer.  

•	It is always best to dress appropriately. This shows the employer sincerity on the part of the applicant applying for the job. One must have finger-nails and hair well groomed for the interview. The outfit worn should be professional.  This would mean that shoes must be used to match the outfit. If you typically wear a lot of jewelry, it is advisable to remove and tone it down for the interview.

•	When you are in front of the employer, smile and greet the interviewer with a firm (but not bone crushing) handshake  which is always a good start to get the interview moving. 

•	During the course of the interview, listen very well to the questions asked. Each must be answered truthfully and confidently to be able to sell yourself to the potential employer. 

•	Afterwards, the applicant should thank the recruiter for the time that was given to meet for the interview.
