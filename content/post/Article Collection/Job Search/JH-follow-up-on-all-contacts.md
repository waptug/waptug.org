"How to Follow Up on All Contacts"

If you are still in the job search process, it is extremely important to follow up on all contacts. It is not good to just sit and wait for results to come pouring in when you think that you've already done your part because your contact information has been distributed.

Consider two men applying for a prime position at a company. After the interview, the first applicant just sits around waiting to hear from his prospective employer.

On the other hand, the second applicant distributes his contact information to some people that he met in the company. Furthermore, applicant number two does a follow-up on the results of the job interview a few days later. The first applicant has not been heard from, because he just relies on the basic "We'll call you" routine. Who do you think will have a greater chance of getting the job?

Even though the first applicant is more qualified, since he did not follow up or even send a thank you note to the interviewer, in the end, he does not get the job.

If you are still waiting for that job offer and you do not follow up on your contacts, your chances of getting hired become slimmer. In business, following up on all of your contacts is a sure-fire way to spread the word about you, your business sense and expanding your horizons.

If you are still looking for a job, here are some tips on how to follow up on your contacts:

* Send a thank you note right after the interview, ideally after a couple of days. This is a way of getting the prospective employer to hear from you again. Should you not get hired for the current position that they offer, someone from that company will likely keep your information on file for future consideration.

* Make sure that you leave your mobile and landline number, e-mail address and home address so that prospective employers will have no excuse of not getting in touch with you.

* Be accurate in getting the contact information of perspective employers. In return, when you place their information on any letter that you send out (i.e. resumes, thank you notes) avoid typographical errors and make sure that you have their names correct, to see to it that everything is in order.

* Some companies do take a look at your character references so alert the people on your list that they might receive a call from your prospective employers.

* Always be on the positive side. Should you not get hired for a particular position, you may ask the people from that company for referrals to other companies or at least keep you in mind for future hiring.

If you are currently in business, whether you are just starting out or in the midst of expanding, you also need to make sure to follow up on all important contacts. For example, you go to a corporate event and you have distributed a lot of business cards. Do not stop there. These people might eventually bring big business to your company so it is important to build up a strong business relationship with them. 

Here are some tips on following up on your contacts if you are already in business:

* Send thank you notes to current and future customers. This rule does not just apply to people applying for a job. This is much more helpful for those who are already in business, as a simple thank you note would remind customers of which company they are dealing with and your brand name will be imprinted on their minds. This practice should send more business your way.

* Send follow up messages. If you are in sales, it is good to follow up on existing buyers who are most likely to purchase your products again.

You might also want to personalize any correspondence that you send out as this leaves the customers feeling as if they know you personally. This should lead you to earning their trust, which in turn leaves the customer feeling secure that you are handling efficiently whatever business it is that they throw your way.

* Make sure that you follow up swiftly and promptly. The rule of thumb is to reply fast, fast, fast. Whether it is a solution to a problem or sending out an order or replying to a letter, responding quickly to a customer is the easiest way for them to think of you and your company in a positive way.
