The Controversy Around Corporate Blogging

Corporate blogging is a relatively new idea, and the jury
is still out on whether it will succeed. This controversial
marketing tool may be the beginning of a new kind of
advertising strategy, or it may fizzle out in a matter of
months. Many companies are looking for ways to
capitalize on the blogging trend, and many of these
corporations have determined that a great way to ride
the blogging wave is to keep a blog on their corporate
website. These blogs are often created to appeal to the
demographic that the company needs to court, and the
content may have quite a lot to do with the activities of
the corporation, or it may have very little to do with the
company itself. Often, a corporate blog will focus on
the kinds of content likely to attract the desired surfers,
even if that content is not related to the product or
service that the company provides. 

Some bloggers feel that corporate blogging is a kind of
validation for the blogging movement, and shows that
this exciting new medium has really infiltrated the
mainstream. Other bloggers consider the kind of viral
marketing that corporate blogs practice to be unethical
or distasteful. In any case, watching the evolution of
corporate blogs and whether they survive and
proliferate or fail and disappear promises to provide
some interesting insight into today's consumers.
