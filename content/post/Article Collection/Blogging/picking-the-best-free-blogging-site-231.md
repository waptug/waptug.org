Picking The Best Free Blogging Site

Choosing a free blogging site can feel overwhelming
because there are so many options. There are several
large free blog-hosting sites that dominate the
blogosphere, but there are also smaller sites. Whether
you decide to join up with an established site like
blogger or whether you choose to sign on with a
relatively new venture depends on what your priorities
are. 

Reliability is perhaps the best reason to opt for a large
and well known free blogging site. When you choose to
have an established brand host your blog, you can feel
secure that your blog will not crash often and will not
disappear in the middle of the night. A company that
has been around for a while is likely to have the
resources to make sure that its clients aren't
unpleasantly surprised by any technical glitches.
However, many bloggers decide that this isn't enough
of a selling point. The bloggers who choose to go with
smaller, newer blog hosting sites do so for a variety of
reasons, but perhaps the number one advantage is a
fairly abstract one. Bloggers tend to relish the fact that
the internet is a place where the underdog has a strong
chance of success, and by choosing to have a small
company as a blog host, a blogger is casting his or her
vote for David against Goliath.
