  Blogging 101

  Blogging 101 is mostly about the blogging
  vocabulary. To understand blogs, you need to know
  the terms blog, platform, domain, and web host.
  Once you have mastered these key elements of
  blogging, you can enter any conversation about
  blogging with confidence. After you know what
  exactly a blog is, you will be on your way to
  passing the final exam of blogging 101. 
  
  Blog is short for weblog, which simply means a
  series of online posts presented in reverse
  chronological order. That's all! Most blogs are text,
  but there are also photo blogs and video blogs. The
  rest of blogging 101 has to do with the technical
  side of things. If you are setting up a blog, you will
  need a platform, a web host, and a domain. A
  blogging platform is a computer software program
  that allows you to write posts and to update your
  blog. Your platform is also what you use to design
  the look of your blog, from color scheme to font
  size. The web host is sort of like the virtual file
  cabinet where your blog is stored. Your computer
  communicates with the host when you upload or
  edit a post. The domain is the online address of
  your blog, and usually ends in â€˜dot com'. Now that
  you know what a blog is, what a platform is, and
  what domains and hosts are, congratulate yourself!
  You have passed blogging 101.
