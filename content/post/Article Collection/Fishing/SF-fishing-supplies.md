The Basic Fishing Supplies


Fishing is a nature-oriented sport that allows you to relax. Many people want to experience fishing, but are unable to buy the appropriate supplies for their adventure. 

There are many fishing stores around, but majority of the stores try to sell unnecessary fishing supplies to gain more from the innocence of the fishing novice. Here are some of the basic fishing supplies you need for any kind of fishing in any location.

1) Hooks – In a variety of shape and sizes, these are one of the most important parts of your fishing gear. Fishing hooks are affordable, so you could stock an assortment of hooks for each kind of fishing. Majority of hooks are shaped like a letter “J.”

2) Rigs – These are used for catching different kinds and species of fish. The two most common rigs are the Bobber and Crappie.  Bobber rigs are suitable for catching Bluegills and are best for beginners. 

3)  Sinkers – As the name suggests, this fishing equipment is used to cast lighter lures and to quickly drop the bait to the bottom of the water where the fish are located. Together with the bobbers, the sinkers are used to hold your line at any given point. 

In fishing stores, you will find numerous variations of sinkers that come in different sizes, weights, and shapes. The current speed and the water depth would determine the weight of the sinkers you will need for your fishing trip.

4) Bobber – It is also called a cork or a float. The bobber’s purpose is to let you know when a fish bites your bait. The commonly used bobbers are pencil, slip bobbers and buttons. They come in different sizes to fit all kinds of baits and sinkers.  The best bobbers are those that are smaller. The wind would blow the bobber back to you if it were too light and would scare the fishes off when it is too big. 

5) Swivels – This kind of fishing equipment is used when you are fishing with bait such as a spinner or a minnow. These kinds of bait tend to twist and turn, which would likely your line deformed.  By using the swivel and connecting it between your line and bait, it would allow the lure to spin around without tangling up the line. Swivels are affordable and come in different sizes to fit the bait and hooks you use.

Other supplies are the tackle box and your bait. The bait would vary depending on the kind of fishing you wish to perform.

Now that you know the basics, you could easily enjoy your fishing trip affordably and safely
