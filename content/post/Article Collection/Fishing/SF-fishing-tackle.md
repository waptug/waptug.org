Fishing Tackle Guidelines


Fishing can be an extremely enjoyable and relaxing adventure.  As long as you have the right tools, the fishing safety knowledge, and a little bit of support from friends or family, you could perform your fishing successfully.

However, the most overlooked factor in buying equipments is choosing the right fishing tackle.  You should follow these simple guidelines in the selection of tackles.

1) You should choose the appropriate fishing flies that you would be using to catch the kind of fish you will be targeting to seize. The basic rule in choosing the kind of fly is to know which is abundant in that actual environment. 

2) Once you have determined which fly to use, you should be able to choose the appropriate line to use. The three commonly used tackles are fly-fishing, plug casting and spinning. The difference between the three is that spinning and plug-casting makes use of bait as weight to drag the line from its reel to the target point of your fishing. 

3) Fly lines come in four different types – weight-forward, double taper, shooting-taper and level taper. Within the four different types are numerous variations. However, once you have decided what kind of fishing wish to accomplish and what kind of fish you wish to catch, you will be using only a particular fishing line.

The fishing lines have numbers that rank from one to fifteen. However, the most common among anglers are the lines numbered from three to twelve in weight. As a basic rule for optimum catching, the first thirty feet of your line should be weighted and matched to the rod. 

4) The next thing you should purchase is the rod and reel. The most suitable equipment for beginners is the spin-casting gears that is easy to operate and provides the least setbacks. For any kind of fishing, the recommended spin-casting reel is mounted on a light-action six-foot casting rod and spooled with an eight-pound test line. The reel and rod could be purchased as a package in many fishing stores. Most professional anglers prefer bait-casting and spinning tackle.

5) You would need sinkers, hooks and bobbers. Sinkers and hooks could be bought in different pack with different styles and sizes. When selecting bobbers, always keep in mind that the smaller the bobber, the better the performance. The struggling of the fish would depend on the size of your bobber.

6) Professional anglers prefer artificial lures. The recommended sizes of lures are 1/8 ounce up to ¼ ounce.

Remember that the kind of tackle would depend on the fish you prefer to catch. Avoid buying unnecessary fishing items and enjoy your affordable fishing experience.
