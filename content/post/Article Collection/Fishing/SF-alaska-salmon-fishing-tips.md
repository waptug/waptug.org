Tips in fishing for salmons in Alaska


Alaska is known as one of the most bountiful areas with salmon, and is ideal for fishing trips.  

This is because of extreme tides along the West Coast and the gush of ocean currents that create an environment ideal for the breeding of thousands of baitfish.

It is also known as one of the best places to go if one wants to fish for giant King Salmon, the largest specie of salmon fish.

The best way to catch these giant salmon (in saltwater) is through trolling or by angling a baited line drawn into the water.

Fishing for giant King Salmon can be a year round activity (especially in Seward). 

The most sought-after species of salmon are the following:

1. The King Salmon (Chinook) are the largest of all these species.  Its weight averages between 20-40 pounds, the heaviest recorded of which is 112 pounds, and can be as long as 3-4".  It has a blue-green back that is lightly spotted.

The average life span of a Chinook Salmon is about five to seven years.

Its flesh can range in color from ivory white to a deep red.

Common names for this specie of salmon include tyee, springs, mouth/kings quinnat and tule.

2. Silver Salmon (Coho) on the other hand is slightly smaller with an average weight of 8-12 pounds.

These specie prefer small streams in which to spawn between the months of July to November.

3. Sockeye salmon, on the other hand, are the most sought-after of its entire species because its flesh has a color of deep red and it has a firm rich flavor.

In fishing for salmon in Alaska, one has to be well equipped with the right equipment (and donned with the appropriate apparel).

Listed below are some of the needed equipment/materials and tips for hassle-free fishing:

1. You must be clad in layers of warm clothes (not necessarily bulky ones as it can hinder in the fishing activity).

2. Over these everyday clothes, a waterproof overall, boots and bibs are likewise necessary to ensure that one would stay dry since after a hook-up, some fish may resist with maximum struggles.

3. Fleet or cruisers that offer services for fishing are usually stocked with bait. 

4. A guide on board a cruiser ensures that even amateur fishermen will enjoy the activity by providing crash-lessons onboard. They usually hook the bait for the guest and inform the party as to where specific species of fish may thrive for selective fishing.
