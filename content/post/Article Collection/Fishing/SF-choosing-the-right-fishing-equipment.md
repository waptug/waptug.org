“Fishing Kit Basics”

Before going deeper into the technicalities, make sure that a fishing license is secured.  To be an amateur fisherman there are basic pieces of fishing equipment needed to complete your exciting journey in the fishing world.  Knowing the line type and matching the right rod and reel to the fishing technique is just basic common sense.  Match these tools appropriately and expect a more enjoyable experience for a more comfortable fishing.  There are several things that causes the reel to turn into a bird's nest, don't worry, even experienced fishermen encounter this every now and then.  

The main objective is to match the rod, the reel, the line and the lure.  These will only cost a newbie around $25 to $40 and they could last for years.  The 3 main issues when shopping for a rod are:  Guides that are attached to the rod; Grip or handle holds the rod and could come in either cork or foam.  They come in different lengths so the comfort to the user must be considered; and the reel seat where the reel is connected.

Dealers make a lot of fishing rods that could either be single or consist of two or more pieces when assembled.  The connection is very simple; just connect the male and female ends together to make sure the guides are lined up.  This would only last for a minutes.  Sometimes, lubricants are needed.  When shopping for a rod, slightly bend it to get the feel of it.  Again comfort should be considered when using the equipment.

Rods of any type will work.  It should be around 6' long and medium weight.  Even a long stick will work.  This should be long, straight and flexible so it will not easily break.  The most popular rod is Graphite because it is so light yet so strong.  Wispy rods should be up to 4m long to be used for long casts in moderate winds.

There are a lot of fishing lines to choose from and it can be very confusing to find the best.  It is mostly made of nylon and "monofilament" that comes in spools of different lengths that are called Tests.  The larger the fishing line the thicker it is in diameter.  Find a piece of a 4lb. or 4 lb. Test that is almost 10' long for the basic rig.  

The basic rule is that all the gears should match. To summarize your fishing kit, it should include other stuff as well: net, stringer, line clippers, fishing knife, first aid box, a pail of bait, sunglasses, fishing hat, and talking about the basics, don't forget your SNACKS!
