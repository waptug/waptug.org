Tips on Fly Fishing

There are thousands of live-bait anglers, who are excellent sportsmen, but the fly fisherman can practice better conservation from the beginning. 

Basically, fly fishing is not only one of the fastest growing sports; it is one of the foremost forms of conserving  natural resources as well as providing aquatic recreation. 

Fly fishing is, very simple when three things are right: you must have a suitable rod; you must get a line to match it; and you must learn correct casting technique.

For people who wish to know some tips on fly fishing, here is a list of some pointers that could help anglers harness their fly fishing skills:

1. Material of the rod 

For one of moderate means, and especially for the beginners, hollow glass is advised since it will require less care than bamboo and will not take a set if improperly handled or stored.

2. Line

Your fly casting skill will not progress with a mismatched rod and line. About 99 times in 100, the troubled fly caster has a line much too light to bring out the action of his rod.

That is why it is important to know that on any given rod, the fly fisherman should use the same size line for anything from small trout and bluegills up to the largest sea fish.

In choosing the size line, anglers should get a C level, an HCH double-taper, or a GBF three-diameter. This choice is based on the fact that a high percentage of fly rods bought nowadays are hollow glass, and that a great majority of these works best with lines of those sizes, almost regardless of lengths or weights.

3. The correct casting technique

In casting, it is important to get about 20 feet of line out front. Anglers should always remember to cast a straight line. Avoid jerky movements even if it is on a faster mode in order to do so.

Best of all, the angler should be relaxed because taunt muscles will ruin his casting.

Boiled down, there should be no reason why you should not learn the fundamental principles just as easily as those who now enjoy fly fishing.

Probably, the best and surest way to learn to cast successfully is to spend a day on the stream with some fisherman who is a competent caster.

Lessons learned on the stream are the best tips you can acquire anywhere in your quest for learning fly fishing.
