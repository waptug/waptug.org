Fishing in Salt Water 


There will always be challenges whether one decides to fish either in the river or in the open sea. The important thing to remember is to have patience waiting for the fish and doing your best to catch it when it appears. 

To be able to fish, a person needs to get a fishing license since this is a requirement by law and the regulations regarding fishing varies from one state to the other. 

The first thing one needs for salt water fishing is a boat.  It can range from a simple row boat to a yacht. The size of this vessel depends on how many people will join the trip.

For people who will do it in-shore, a 15 foot sailboat that comes with a cuddy forward to serve as a shelter when it rains should do the job. The boat should not be heavy and yet adequately sturdy to not be swayed by the action of strong waves or some bumps on the beach or on the rocks. 

One should always try the edges of the perimeter first instead of plopping bait or lure in the middle. This is because it will scare the other fish away. By going through the sides first, one will have a better chance of catching unsuspecting fish in the middle. 

If one decides to go "down below" some time, a cod-line is a necessity for everybody to enjoy saltwater fishing. A perch-line will also be good and if it's time for mackerel fishing, a mackerel jig will be an excellent help. 

The right time to start salt water fishing is on the ebb tide. This should be during an early time of the morning to ensure that the trip will be a productive one. This will put the tide in oneâ€™s favor and if the wind is light or not fair, this will also help in going home quickly.

The best place to start fishing is going to a fishing ground that is well known to the locals. 

Many anglers who are too impatient move from one spot to another which at times make these people miss a hotspot further decreasing the chances of catching fish.  It is advisable to cast out a couple of times before moving on using different types of bait. This should be done from the shallowest to the deepest point. 

Sharks in the area can disrupt people from catching fish. By pouring some fish blood on a paper towel or newspaper and rolling it into a ball then casting it overboard, sharks will follow the current and leave the area increasing the chances of catching fish.
