Fishing Game: Nature’s Playground

If all men measured up to the standards of true sportsmanship, there would be no need for game, fish, and forestry laws. Neither would there be so much need for the laws that regulate human affairs in general.

But, in the fishing game, it is the true sportsman, with a love for the great outdoors, a wholesome respect for the welfare of others, and consideration for living and growing things, who sets the good examples for the youth to follow.

In reality, fishing games differ a lot from the other types of games that man has come to know. A fishing game is not a mere reflection of the activity itself but more of the love for fishing.

In fishing games, the angler does not go hunting or fishing only to gain the privilege of boasting over slaughter or material gain. He loves the lightning-like flash of the trout, the leap of the bass or muskie, the tug on the line, the whir of the reel, the thrill of battle with some “denizens” of the deep, and the companionship of other true sportsmen.

The Concept of Fishing Games

The most common type of fishing game is known as the “offshore game fishing.” In this type of game fishing, the anglers aim for the big lean fishes like the marlins and the tunas and the fishing is done in the sea.

Offshore game fishing is usually conducted as one type of recreational activity. Though, there are instances wherein this type of fishing game is also employed in competitions like the sports fishing.

Because of the energy being utilized in this type of recreational activity, offshore game fishing usually requires the biggest fishing boats. These fishing boats generally range from 30 to 50 feet in length.

The object of the game is to reel the fish in once it is properly hooked on the line. This can be a daunting task since the fish, especially if it is a big one, will have the tendency to pull away from the boat. The challenge is to reel the fish in while keeping the fishing line maintained on its specified tension.

The fishing game is not more of a competition for a true angler. Whenever they are doing this kind of activity as part of the game, what the angler really wants is to get in touch with nature, to breathe the clean, pure air, and muse in solitude in the wilds of nature’s playground.

Hence, in fishing games like offshore game fishing, the anglers like to play the game in strict accordance with the rules of reason and fairness at the same time conserve the value of fishes in the community.
