Catfishing the Right But Simple Way

There are a few basic methods that are effective in catching catfish.  Bear in mind that specific methods are applicable to specific kinds of waters.  That is because techniques and baiting mixtures are formulated for specific targets.

The following methods are simple, yet proven successful when used:

1) Rigging method - Depending on the bait used, loop the bait holder or the treble hook from a line to a preferred distance to the end.  Bait movement is not suggested; therefore, a weight must be used to allow the rig to be still.  A good distance shall be about 18" to 24."  

Same as the first method, using the Slipweight to make the bait stable is also effective.  The weight does not matter as long as it can slide in the line.  The fish will not feel any weight and it will be late until they realize that the bait is fake.

Multibait technique allows multiple catches at once.  Simply place three-way swivel along the line.  As it draws more strikes it makes a great choice for catching more catfish at the same time.

2) Bait - Experts opt for chicken livers or medium sized shrimp from groceries.  The shrimp's tail and skin must be removed and body should be big enough to slide up in a number 6 hook.  This is simpler than the chicken which necessitates the use of pantyhose.  A diameter of a quarter is wrapped in a piece of pantyhose leaving a tag end then attach it through the treble hook.  Blood worms, minnows, catfish paste, night crawlers, snails, living or dead small fish, and dough baits are also good choices of baits.  Remember that the best baits are always those that nature produced. 

3) Chumming - Fishermen catch more catfish with this method.  This is simply throwing balls of mixtures of natural recipes in the fishing area.  This attracts more catfish; the trick is that the mixture should be right enough for the catfish to feed heavily.  The hook that will be used to fish normally must have the same recipe for the bait.  Adding a good smelling flavor into the pasty mixture attracts catfish more.  

4) Tackling - Although the technique involved in this method is by far effective, it's still the bait that attracts and brings the catfish in.  As simple as it is, the tackle should be about 6 feet long with a spinning real.  Choose heavier lines to allow more battle between the fisherman and the catfish.  It doesn't necessarily have to be expensive.  The experience you get from a cheaper tackle is no different from an expensive one.

Make sure the grip is secure hooks are removed by pliers after catching the fish.  Avoid being stuck with the fins as some are poisonous.  Just simply sliding the hand up to its belly from tail, placing the fingers behind one side and thumb behind the other can remove the catfish from the hook without any harm.  Happy catfishing and good luck!
