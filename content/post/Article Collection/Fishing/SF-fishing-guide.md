Tips on Finding a Fishing Guide 

1. Open Communication matters. It is important that you provide the guide all the information they need so that they will figure out what kind of fishing trip is best for you. Be sure to be honest in telling the guide how much experience you have regarding fishing. This will help them to know what advice and tips to give you so that you can make the most out of your time.

2. Seek the help of friends and relatives. Ask your friends and relatives who have fished and if not they may be able to provide you with some referrals. It is better to ask them about their experiences, the things that you need to do and things that you have to look for in a guide. They may be also to provide you referrals of the guides they have tried and found effective for them. This will be a chance for you to ask if the guide they are referring you to has enough knowledge or is accommodating to clients.

3. Browse the Internet. The Internet can provide a lot of websites where you can find the best guides in a certain location. You can also post messages and questions regarding the website and they may be able to find the information you need.

4. Determine if your prospective guide is licensed. It is better that you know that the person you are working with is working according to the law. A licensed guide is also sure to be relied on especially with the matters of integrity and trust. Ask the guide of their name and phone numbers including the state-licensing bureau. A guide who is not willing to provide you the information you are asking for is not worth your time.

5. Find out exactly what you are paying for and how long the amount would cover. You need to know this information for you to be able to manage your schedule before the fishing trip and plan the things that you need to bring which are not covered by the payment you made. Some include the price for lodging in the package while other guides may charge extra for that. Asking the coverage of your fees will also help you assess if the services you will get is worth the money you will be spending.

6. Get to know the guide. Evaluate if the guide that you will be working with can get along with you. If not, you will just be wasting your time and money. Fishing is a time to learn and enjoy but if the two of you will not get along well, the whole trip might just be ruined. Get to know the guide first before you set foot on the boat. Exert a little effort to call the guide and make a small chat to break the ice and make the two of you comfortable on the day of the actual fishing.

7. Also make time to find out how long the prospective guide has been on his job. This will make it easier for you to assess the level of experience the guide has earned in that field. It is better that you choose a guide that has been in fishing for many years. They are the ones who usually have the skills and teaching techniques that will be of great help to you.
