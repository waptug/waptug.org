Newport Beach Shoppers Paradise

Although the area of Newport Beach is known for
the harbor and love of the water, it also contains
a hidden shoppers paradise.  With the infamous 
Fashion Island and Balboa Island nearby, Newport 
does wonders for those who like activities yet
enjoy shopping.

Fashion Island is one of the best areas of Newport
Beach, containing over 200 stores.  The Island 
has everything you could ever want, from toys to
expensive clothes.  If you've ever tried Fashion
Island before, you're probably aware of just how
great it can be.  With over 200 stores, it'll take
hours and hours to explore everything here - and
possibly even days.

If you happen to be looking for an inexpensive, yet
excellent experience, Balboa Island is where you 
should be going.  The Island is accessible from 
Palm Street by ferry at the Balboa Peninsula, or
by car/foot from Jamboree Road at the Pacific Coast
Highway.

With its great location and environment, the 
community is home to more than 80 galleries, gift
shops, and fine restaurants.  All along the streets
on the island, you can find locals selling great
merchandise, along with vendors selling superb
sweets and hot eats.

When walking on foot on the island, you'll notice
that there are wonderful views of the extravagent 
homes, harbor, and even the bay.  Passing the street
signs, you may notice that they are indeed named
after precious stones, which is quite different.

Once you pass Turquoise, Topax, Diamond, and Sapphire,
you'll reach the popular Marine Avenue, which is 
where shoppers will fall in love.  With unique and
attractive gift shops and sidewalk cafes, it's easy
to spend hours here looking at everything you can
purchase.

The heart of the Balboa Island's shopping and apparel
district, Marine Avenue has many unique boutiques
and galleries as well.  If hunger strikes, you can 
lose yourself in the tastefully impressive Balboa Bar,
a bar made of vanilla ice cream that is dipped in 
chocolate.  

With restaurants on the Avenue as well, you can enjoy
everything from a simple meal to some of the best
Italian food in Newport Beach.  Offering you plenty of
things to see as well, Balboa Island gives you more
than just shopping - although the shopping here is 
something you must experience.

If you enjoy shopping and seeing beautiful views, 
Newport Beach is truly the shopping paradise you've
been longing for.  As a family vacation, Balboa Island
and the surrounding areas can provide everything you
need for fun and entertainment.  For shopping lovers
everywhere, Newport Beach provides the type of 
shopping you won't find anywhere else.
