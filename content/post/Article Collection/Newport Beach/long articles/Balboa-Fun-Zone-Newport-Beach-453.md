Balboa Fun Zone Newport Beach

One of California's oldest and greatest coastal
amusement parks, the Balboa Fun Zone is a great 
place for your entire family.  With plenty for the
entire family to do, the Fun Zone can make the
time just fly by.

Perfectly situated on the Balboa Peninsula along 
Newport Beach, the Balboa Fun Zone has always 
managed to rival with top amusement park giants such
as Sea World, Disneyworld, and even Belmont Park.

For more than 50 years, the Fun Zone in Newport 
Beach has provided people with something to do either
day or night.  Residents of the area and those who
have visited in the past can recall the big name
bands and loud music that streamed from the infamous
Rendezvous Ballroom.

From basking on the sandy yet pristine beaches to 
exploring the Fun Zone areas, you'll quickly find that
there's always something to do here.  You can go out
on the Balboa Pier as well, which was built in 1912 as
a way to go from Balboa to Catalina Island. The pier is
also one of the few to survive the well known yet
destructive coastal storms California endured during 
the 1980's.

Those of you looking for adventure and travel would
enjoy the Catalina Flyer, which is actually one hour
to Catalina Island.  The island ferry at Balboa Island
only costs a buck or so, yet it takes you to the well
known Catalina Island.  

One of the biggest attractions here is the well known
Fun Zone ferris wheel.  Since 1936, this wheel has proved
to be a night and day landmark at the Fun Zone, calling
out to all to enjoy the fun.  If you've ever been on
a ferris wheel, you know just how much fun they can 
actually be.

In 1986, the Fun Zone was rebuilt completely from the
ground up, adding to the already fun and exciting 
environment here.  The ferris wheel, bumper cars, arcades,
and everything else here make the Fun Zone so much
fun for everyone who decides to pay it a visit.

After you've had experienced a few of the rides and
attractions, you can get some food at one of the many
vendors or restaurants, then enjoy a cruise on the
harbor.  Young or old, the Balboa Fun Zone in Newport
Beach can help you relieve those precious memories
from when you were a child.

If you plan to visit California and you want something
fun to do, make sure you visit the Fun Zone.  There are
plenty of things to see in the area as well, making the
Fun Zone an absolute treasure.  With no cost for 
admission, the Fun Zone is one area of Newport Beach 
that you don't want to pass by.
