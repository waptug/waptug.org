Balboa Pier In Newport Beach

A pier can be one of the most romantic places to
go in the world.  If you doubt that, take a trip to
the Balboa Pier in Newport Beach and you'll see 
first hand just how great a pier can be.  On any
given summer night, this pier is enveloped in
darkness by 10 PM.

While the average fisherman heads home when the 
pier is dark, life continues.  All along the pier,
darkness does nothing but add to the atmosphere.
Towards the end of the pier, you can see the neon
lights of Ruby's Diner lighting up the sky, calling
out to those on the pier.

Walking along the pier you can see many different
lights illuminating the sky.  The Balboa Pavilion can
be seen as well, adding to the already magical time
that the lights help to add to the pier.

In many ways, the Balboa Pavilion is a sister attraction
to the pier.  They were both built in 1906 and designed
to attract people to the Newport area.  Even in those
times, the pier and the pavilion helped to bring 
travelers to the area.

Down the peninsula from the pier, the area has a 
feeling that rivals days gone by.  For fishermen and
those that enjoy fishing, the Balboa Pier is simply
heaven on earth.  

Looking to the south of the pier, you'll see the Newport
Jetty and the bay entrance.  Main Street is right 
around the corner, adding a wealth of things to do to
the pier.  

Even though some consider fishing to be secondary on 
the pier, it gives fisherman that are there more room
to fish.  For many residents of the area, the pier is
where they began their life of fishing.

When standing on at the end looking down the Balboa 
Pier you'll probably be amazed.  The 920 foot pier is
simply incredible to look at.  Walking down it is 
great any time of year, especially at night when 
taking a moonlit stroll.  For honeymooners or married
couples, the pier beckons out for romance.

The Balboa Pier is open from 5 AM until midnight.  There
are restrooms located near the entrance, with lights
and fish cleaning stations located on the pier.  At
the end of the pier, there is even a small restaurant.

Located in the city of Newport Beach, the Balboa Pier
is a must visit for anyone who loves fishing.  Even if
you don't like fishing, the pier is great to walk at
night or during the day.  If you want to see what piers
are all about, make sure you check out the beauty and
splendor that the Balboa Pier will provide you with.
