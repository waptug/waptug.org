Newport Harbor Art Museum

Featuring vintage art, the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum is the primary showcase in Newport Beach 
or California for that matter for the best in 
contemporary art.  Being founded in 1962, the 
museum is dedicated to the collection, exhibition,
and the interpretation of both contemporary and
modern art.

By reflecting on the past as well as the present, 
the museum features the exhibitions of local, national
and international scopes, and also maintains one of
the most impressive and important works of California
Art since the beginning and end of World War 2.

For those who don't know much about contemporary art,
the Newport Harbor Art Museum offers a broad series
of programs designed in assisting the understanding
and appreciation of the subject.  Even though you 
may be new to contemporary art, the museum will 
show you all there is to know and love about it.

Known all over the world, the museum has a reputation
for its depth of holdings in California post-war art,
a collection of over 2,000 sculptures, paintings,
prints, drawings, and even photography.  

Those who are already familiar with contemporary art
will surely appreciate everything that the museum
provides.  Fans of post-war art will enjoy this 
museum as well, as it provides the most extensive
collection of California art around.

Some of the key holdings found in the Newport Harbor
Art Museum include David Park, Nathan Oliveira, Joan
Brown, Ed Ruscha, Larry Bell, Joe Goode, Robert Irwin,
Chuck Arnoldi, and Judy Fiskin.  There are also major
holdings in room size works featuring Bill Viola's 
Theater of Memory and even the Tale of Two Cities by
Chris Burden.

Open year round, the museum hours are Tuesday -
Saturday 10 AM - 5 PM and Sunday 12 PM - 5 PM, closed
on Monday.  Although there is small price for
admission, the day to visit is Tuesday - as admission
for everyone is free.  If you are in the Newport area
on Tuesday, you should drop by the museum as you have
nothing to lose.

If your on vacation in Newport Beach, you can go to
the Newport Harbor Art Museum during the day, on a
side trip.  The museum is a great way to spend the
day looking at art.  For the locals of the area, the
museum is a great place to go back to time and time
again to bring back memories of the post-war art and
everything that contemporary California art is known
for.
