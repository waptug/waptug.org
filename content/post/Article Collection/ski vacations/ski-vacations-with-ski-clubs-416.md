Ski Vacations with Ski Clubs

There are many different types of clubs throughout 
the world. In fact, there is a club or organization for 
just about everything that you can imagine! Skiing is 
no exception. Ski clubs are a great way to learn new 
things, and to go on ski vacations with other 
members. In fact, ski club members often get 
discounted rates on ski vacation packages.

No matter where you live, there is a ski club near 
you. This is true even if you live in a place that does 
not ever get snowfall! These clubs regularly get 
together for trips to various mountains, ski areas, 
and ski resorts. Some are local clubs, meaning that 
the slopes that they ski on are within driving 
distance, while others are more national or global, 
which means that they not only ski locally, if 
possible, but they also plan ski trips.

Again, members of ski clubs often receive deep 
discounts on ski vacation packages. Arrangements 
are usually made through the club, so that everyone 
is eligible for the discounts. The money that is 
required from each member for the trip is usually 
paid to the club, and the club passes the funds on
to pay for lodging, airfare, meals, lift tickets, and 
other perks that are included in the trip. Because 
arrangements are being made for a group of people
– which is usually fairly large – discounts are given. 
This benefits all members of the club.

The discounts aren’t the only thing to be excited 
about. These clubs get together regularly – even if 
they aren’t getting together to ski. They join together 
for other activities as well, such as cookouts and 
fundraisers. Many ski clubs do annual fundraisers to 
help less fortunate families and children at Christmas 
time. Others do annual fundraisers to help preserve 
the environment – which is usually a topic of great 
importance to skiers who love being out in the wide 
open spaces and fresh air. 

While skiing is what brings these groups together in 
the first place, it is not necessarily what keeps them 
together. Their love of a common sport, and their 
common interests and feeling of community is what 
keeps them together – and it keeps them skiing 
together for years and years. If you are a skier, you 
should definitely consider joining a club. It doesn’t 
matter – in most cases – what level you are at. 
Beginners are usually welcomed, and this is a great 
way for beginners to quickly improve their skills and 
techniques out on the slopes.
