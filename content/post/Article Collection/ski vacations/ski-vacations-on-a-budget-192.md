Ski Vacations on a Budget

When you start thinking about ski vacations, you will 
find a lot of information about various resorts and 
packages. Finding terrific vacation spots isn't difficult, 
however, finding ski vacations that fit into your budget 
can be a challenge.

To save money, look for lesser known resorts. This 
doesn’t mean that these resorts won’t provide you 
with a fun vacation – it simply means that they aren’t 
quite as well known as other resorts, and therefore, 
the prices may be a great cheaper. Also look for ski 
vacation packages that will include your lodging, lift 
tickets, lessons, rentals, and possibly even some 
meals. 

Be willing to make some sacrifices if money is a real 
issue. For instance, instead of eating in an expensive 
restaurant each night, eat cheaper fast food, or make 
sandwiches in your room. Borrow equipment from 
friends instead of renting it. Join a group for lessons 
instead of taking private lessons. Don’t stay at a 
lodge, stay at a motel farther away from the slopes 
if necessary. There are numerous ways that you can 
cut down on the expense of your ski trip. It is all about 
the powder after all!
