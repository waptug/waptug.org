Nub’s Nob Ski Vacations

If you will be in Michigan, you should definitely visit 
Nub’s Nob Ski Resort. Nub’s Nob has what is 
considered to be the Midwest’s best snow, and the 
resort has a reputation for being a family friendly 
mountain. Generations of families have brought their 
children here for their very first ski run. 

The mountain layout is fairly simple with an elevation 
of 1338 feet and a vertical drop of 427 feet. There are 
43 trails serviced by eight chair lifts. Boasting one of 
the best skiing and snowboarding schools in the 
country, both private and group lessons are available. 
If you are brand new to the sport, you can even learn 
to ski free, and take advantage of Nub’s Cubs 
Childcare Center while you learn. 

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that intermediate 
or expert skiers won’t find any challenges waiting for 
them at Nub’s Nob! The terrain is varied, and you will 
find challenges. Night Skiing is also available. The 
Ski School offers training programs for advanced 
skiers who are interested in racing, and many racing 
events are held at the resort. You can signup for race 
leagues at the resort, and many league events are 
planned each season. 

Equipment rental is available, and there is a General 
Store right inside the lodge, where you can purchase 
gloves, hats, and neck warmers among a variety of 
other items. You should also visit the technology 
center to have your ski’s tuned or repaired.

You won’t go hungry either! Nub’s Nob Cafeteria is 
open for breakfast and lunch, and if you brought your 
own lunch, you can eat in the ‘brown bag’ room. 
Nub’s Winter Garden serves grilled burgers when the 
weather allows. Pintail Peak Warming Hut is located 
at the top of the Black Lift. Here, you can enjoy 
amazing views while enjoying home made soups and 
sandwiches. 

Nub’s Nob is the place to go if you want to have a 
great family ski vacation – or if you are already an 
expert skier interested in racing and skill events. 
There is plenty to do and see. In fact, you may find 
that you have a problem deciding which activity to 
participate in first! Don’t worry about missing 
anything, though – if you want to ski now and board 
later, you can do that. Most events are planned for 
the weekends, so arrange your schedule so that you 
are able to attend or participate in the planned events.
