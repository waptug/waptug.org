Ski Vacations at Solitude Mountain Resort, Utah

If you are looking for the ultimate Utah ski vacation,
Solitude Mountain Resort has everything that you 
could want or need. During the early 1900’s, the 
area was full of silver miners, who gave the area its 
famous name. Today, the area is covered with 
skiers – but the crowds are rather light.

The area became a skier’s paradise in 1957. It was 
developed by Robert Barrett, who made his fortune 
as a uranium miner. He basically started developing 
the resort because he was denied restroom privileges 
at the ski area in Alta – because he was not a guest.

Now owned by a different family, the resort features 
1200 acres of 63 runs for beginners, intermediate 
skiers, and experts. There are eight lifts, including 
seven chair lifts and one surface lift. The top 
elevation at Solitude Mountain is 10036 feet, with 
a vertical drop of 2048 feet.

There are five lodging options for guests, and 
activities and events take place all throughout the 
year. The resort looks like a Tom Kincaide painting, 
and one can’t help but wonder if this is where some 
of his inspiration came from!
