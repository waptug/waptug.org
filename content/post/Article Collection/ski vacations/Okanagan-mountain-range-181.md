Okanagan Mountain Range Ski Vacations

Okanagan is a mountain range that runs through 
valleys close to three mountain ranges.During the 
summer this is the perfect place to do some camping,
 but when winter hits you will have great skiing 
weather and conditions. There are small resorts that 
are scattered throughout the area. The climate here 
will make for great skiing down the slopes and through 
the trails.

These scattered resorts are very quiet and peaceful. 
Lifts are available, but they are limited to specific 
times and dates. These resorts have great skiing 
around them, even though they are small. This area 
of mountains offers the most consistent 
weather conditions, and the resort offers lodging for 
everyone that cares to stay - at a reasonable price. 

The mountain ranges offer different trails and skill 
levels, but most of all they provide you with the 
skiing vacation of your dreams. During the winter, 
temperatures in the Okanogan range often drop to 
zero degrees. The items you bring will need to keep 
you warm at all times and safe no matter which trail 
you may choose to ski.
