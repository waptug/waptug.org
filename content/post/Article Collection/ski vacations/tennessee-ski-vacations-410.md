Tennessee Ski Vacations

Located near Gatlinburg, Tennessee, Ober 
Gatlinburg is the only ski resort in the state. It is 
more than just a ski resort, however. It is a complete 
family vacation spot with an amusement park, indoor 
ice skating, a bungee tower, an alpine slide, and 
many other activities and attractions – there is 
something to please everyone.

With an elevation of 3301 feet, and a vertical drop of 
600 feet, Ober Gatlinburg features eight trails: two 
beginner trails, four intermediate trails, and two 
advanced trails. There are three lifts, including two 
quad lifts, one double lift, and one surface lift. The 
season runs from the middle of December through 
early March, and night skiing is allowed on all trails 
except the Grizzly trail.

Rentals are available for both ski equipment and 
snowboarding equipment. Private and group lessons 
for skiing and snowboarding are also available 
through the Smokey Mountain Snow Sport School. 
You can also easily find food at the many snack 
bars, food carts, the café, the restaurant, or in the 
lounge.

You must not miss the longest chair lift ride in the 
south! You will see awesome views of the Great 
Smoky Mountains. You will also get a bird’s eye 
view of some of the slopes, and you can have your 
picture taken on top of the mountain. If you don’t 
ski, don’t worry! You can ride back down the 
mountain on the chair lift as well. Don’t forget the 
Tramway. The tramway departs from downtown 
Gatlinburg and takes you to the ski resort and the 
amusement park. 

Even if you don’t ski, you can still explore the thrill 
of flying down a mountain at a high speed – or a 
slow speed if you choose. This is possible with the 
Alpine Slide. The slide is approximately 1800 feet 
long, and takes you down a winding wooded slope. 
You have total control over your speed with the 
use of a braking device on each sled. Other 
attractions at the amusement park include the 
Black Bear Habitat, a bungee jump, a water race, 
go karts, indoor ice skating, kiddie land, an arcade, 
miniature golf, a Spider Web Velcro Wall Jump, 
water rides, and a shooting range.

No matter what type of fun or adventure you are 
seeking, there is something to satisfy everyone in 
the family at Ober Gatlinburg Ski Resort and 
Amusement Park. This is definitely a trip worth taking
– especially if you have younger kids or senior 
citizens traveling with you.
