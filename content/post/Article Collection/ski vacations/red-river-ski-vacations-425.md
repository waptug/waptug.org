Red River Ski Vacations

Red River, New Mexico is home to one of the most 
popular ski resorts in the United States, and has 
been for many decades. The resort offers six chair 
lifts and one surface lift, and the trails are equally 
divided for beginners, intermediates, and experts. 

Top elevation at Red River is 10354 feet, and the 
vertical drop down the face of the mountain is 1601 
feet. Unfortunately, it doesn’t snow much, and about 
85% of the powder is man made. There are 58 trails 
scattered over 247 acres. Red River is called the ‘ski 
town of the Southwest.’

The resort has three restaurants, all of which offer 
fabulous fare. Lodging can be obtained in cabins, 
chalets, inns, or private condominiums in the area, 
and many lodging packages, as well as ski packages 
are available through Red River Central Reservations. 
Red River also offers snow pass rates which allow 
children to ski for free, and teens to ski at reduced 
rates. This is a great way to save money on your 
family ski vacation. 

Red River also has a ski school, and group lessons 
and private lessons are available. Even if you’ve never 
skied before, you will quickly be on the slopes after 
your lessons. There are even lessons for 
snowboarders, who are welcome on the Red River 
slopes. You can also rent all of your ski and 
snowboarding equipment for very reasonable rates.

The nightlife in Red River is also great. After a day 
on the slopes, you can kick back and relax at the 
lodge, or visit one of the taverns in the area. For the 
younger crowd, there is a great game room located 
right in the center of the town. One of the great things 
about Red River is that everything is within walking 
distance of the lodging areas, and shuttles are 
provided for transportation to and from the slopes.

You can also enjoy taking scenic chairlift rides, 
hiking, biking, horseback riding, camping, 
snow-mobiling, and hunting. You can even take one 
of the jeep tours to go see the abandoned gold mines 
in the area. So, even if you don’t ski, there is still 
plenty of fun to be had at Red River Ski Resort.

Childcare is available while you spend your day on 
the slopes. Your child will be well tended at the Li’l 
Buckaroos Child Care Facility, and the center 
provides lunch for your child as well. At Red River, 
everything has been thought of and taken care of to 
ensure that your ski vacation is as enjoyable as 
possible.
