Bingo for Beginners

Bingo is probably one of the easiest games on the planet; all you need are bingo cards, bingo chips, the ability to recognize numbers, fast eyes and a prize, even children can do it.  

Object of the game:

The object of the game is to complete the pattern called for in a certain game with the lowest number of calls. Patterns are determined before the game starts, it can either be a full horizontal, or vertical, a diagonal, an X, a box, or what they call block out, in which you’ll have to fill your whole card. 

The Bingo Card

The Bingo card has the letters B, I, N, G and O across the top indicating five columns. Each column hast a set of numbers ranging from 1 to 75. 

The B column has numbers from 1-15, the I column has numbers, 16-30, the N column has numbers from 31 – 45, the G column has numbers from 46 to 60, and the O column has numbers from 61 – 75. Each column may only have 5 numbers from their respective range. 

The card forms a grid in which the middle grid, the third row of the N column is labeled free, this cell need not be filled.

The Game

First you need a Bingo card, you may have more than one bingo card at a time, depending on your labeling ability.

The game starts when the host tells everyone the pattern to be formed.

Listen for the fist ball, the host will call out a letter, either B, I, N, G or O, for the column and then a number, e.g. O-70.

Look for this number in your card and label it immediately.

The host continues to call out letters and numbers until someone finishes than pattern required.

The person with a finished pattern should immediately yell bingo! To inform everyone that she has finished the pattern and has won the game.

The host will then verify all the numbers and their position in your card, either by taking your card, or by you shouting out the numbers that made you form the patter.

Another bingo game may resume afterwards, either with the same or different pattern, or same or different prize. 

The prize should be immediately given after a Bingo.

Tips

Never yell BINGO if you haven’t formed a pattern yet, this halts the games and can be a bit annoying for other players.
