POKER TIPS........TO WIN!                                                                    

Poker is a very popular card game, where players with either fully or partially hidden cards bet into a central "pot."  To the player having the best card combination, the accumulated bet in the pot is then handed over.  

Before the dealing of the cards, one or more players, depending on the rule, is required to place an initial bet unto the pot. After which, the cards are dealt, face down.  Thus the beginning of the game.

Strategy should be developed so that one will learn who plays fair or who the sharper player is.  By defining them, one can easily deal with them.  Carefully study each players move so you will prevent loss in your cards.

Poker is a game of strategy.  Even with bad set of cards, a good poker player still has a high chance of winning.  Here are some tips:

*Hand strength.  Any hand that is less than a pair should be folded at the earliest opportunity that comes.  Don't wait that other cards will remedy the situation, because they will not.

*Display a poker face.  This makes the other players wary of your cards.  Your expression will let your opponents know how good or how bad are your cards.  A point to remember, never project any clue to them, if you will, then make certain that if you do have bad cards, pretend you have otherwise.

Do bear in mind that bluffing will not work if you are a poor player.  Meaning players who over estimate the force of their hand.  Also, if a player bluffs repeatedly or regularly, expert players will eventually sense their style and would now know if they are bluffing or not.

*Never be afraid to fold.  One threatening aspect in poker is placing your bet.  As to how much or how little one should bet, feel the game.  As you go along, you will then be knowledgeable and know when to bet and when to fold.  A rule to keep in mind is, don't expect later cards will improve your situation if you have nothing in your hand.  Be free to fold as frequently as needed. 

*Control.  Bet wisely.  This means betting with your head.  Bet only within your means.  You can not gain fortunes in poker, so stay within your limits.

*No alcohol.  As alcohol makes one bolder and daring, it is wise to avoid it at poker time.  You might find yourself betting more in not so good cards.  Avoid alcohol especially when the stakes are high.

It is important for one to devote a lot of time for the development of your own strategy.  The more you play the game, the longer that you are exposed to it, you could then have your own secrets to winning the game.
