Secret Formula of Black Jack Winners

When someone plays a game, they play to win. One of the many simple games at the casino is Blackjack. For those who don't know how to play the game, it's always best to start by learning the basics. 

When playing Blackjack the most important feature to remember is that there are four times as many cards that have a value of 10 (10, J,Q,K) as any other value. With this information, one must always assume that the next card to be drawn from the deck has a value of 10.  

By keeping this in mind, one may realize that if one has any hand that has a value over 12 one will likely lose or in blackjack terms bust (go over 21).  Likewise if the dealer's card is a 2-6 it is likely to draw a 10 card which means he will have to draw again, likely causing him to bust. 

Another way to make the odds more favorable to the player than the dealer is by counting cards. This of course requires many pages and charts that must be memorized.  Having a professionally written guide is very helpful and there are many different authors that have different styles and different counting systems. It's always best to get more than one opinion to find out which style works best.   

Practice makes perfect. By investing time and money with online training software learning the game, it will eventually pay off at the casino.

Upon entering the casino, one must choose the right table to play at. When one observes that the players at a table seem to be winning a lot, it is a good time to join in the action.  Likewise, if you notice the dealer has a lot of chips and the players seem to be doing more losing than winning, then look for a better table. 

Reward the dealer by tipping when one is winning.  If the dealer knows he will be tipped when the players wins,  he may begin rooting and actually do subtle things to help such as performing less thorough shuffles and penetrating deeper into the shoe before he re-shuffles thus allowing the player to get a more accurate count of the cards. 

Though if the dealer starts losing too much money for the casino the pit boss will likely change dealers.  

Although it may be impossible to find the perfect game, one should be familiar with how certain house rules affect the player.  
	
Keep in mind that as a rule of thumb, the fewer decks the casino uses the more advantageous it is for the player.
