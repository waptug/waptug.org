The Truth About Winning Blackjack

Today, more and more people are getting hooked on playing blackjack. In fact, it is considered to be one of the most prevalent and well-liked games in the casino. This is because it is relatively easy to play the game and with the correct strategy, a player can lessen the dealer’s edge and at the same time get an advantage in winning the game.

In order to win blackjack, players must get cards that have a total of 21 or closer to it. If the player gets a card over 21, they will end up losing the game.

In winning a game in blackjack, there is only one concept that players must bear in mind. They should always remember to utilize the right strategy. 

In order to win a blackjack game, the player must know the basic strategies. This is because these strategies are considered as the vital element in winning blackjack. The player's capability to use a line of attack and manipulate the game is the basic skills that a player must learn in order to win. 

So, for people who want to win a game in blackjack, here are some ways how to do it. These things may not guarantee the players to win the game but using them will give them a good chance.

1. Players should know when to hit or stand.

Statistics show that 3 out of the 10 people who play blackjack make hits or stands without even knowing when to do it. Most of them merely rely on their instincts. Instincts can be a pretty factor in winning the game but it is not always like that. So, it is a must that a player should know when to hit or stand just by looking at the cards already dealt and the cards of the dealer.

The idea of when to stand or hit is directly dependent on the dealer’s card.

2. Players should always assume that the dealer’s down card is 10.

This is based on the theory that if the dealer’s down card is a 10 and he gets a 6, chances are he will get the card. If he gets 7, chances are he would either be busted or the player’s probability of getting close to 21 is higher.

In this manner, depending on what card the dealer gets, the player can decide whether to hit or stand. The players will then have higher chances of winning.

Winning blackjack is, indeed, dependent on the dealer’s card.
