Is Offline gambling A Dinosaur?

Over the past twenty plus years internet technology has developed and attracted millions. It has transformed the way people live. The way people consume products or services has changed drastically. People want instant information and service and by extension, people demand instant cash.

In cyberspace a gambler can have easy access to online gaming. Online gaming plays like a real casino but instead of interacting with a dealer at a table you use a web-based software instead.

What’s missing online?

Apparently the lack of atmosphere or ambience when gambling on the Net was cited in a study as one of the most important aspects of offline gambling that is missing online. The online games on the internet try to imitate the real deal by featuring graphics and text animation. Even including verbal interaction. 

With every mouse click, the program gives a corresponding sound like coins in a slot machine. The software-dealer starts talking if there are no action or commands given. Despite all of this though, the atmosphere of a casino hasn’t been recreated. 

The adrenalin rush in a real casino cannot be recreated online either. Playing at home, an online gambler is playing alone and no amount of tinkering in the program can create an atmosphere. The lack of atmosphere prevents a person from gambling with friends. 

The live casino has been associated with a socializing ambience and a lot of gamblers feel an attachment to the environment. 

Hey Big Brother!

The main reason people give for not shopping in the internet is a perceived risk in security. That perception is much higher for online gambling. Although most sites give an information link to the existing security technology, still the perception remains. 

Most people experience great discomfort in using a credit card on online gambling. Not only the perceived security issues that gamblers feel uncomfortable with, it is also the lack of any kind of control on the outcome. 

Online people cannot move from one table to another and make crucial decisions. The reality of losing money on the internet is distorted, most people cannot feel that they are losing money. Simply because of the idea that you’re just sitting at home, how can they lose so much money.

All the light shows and sound effects an online casino can muster, it cannot substitute for the action happening inside the halls of a casino. People feel more in control when playing inside a casino, whether it’s strategizing or managing his money. The thrill of having a crowd and the joy of companionship is also a very important plus. Dinosaurs? Maybe, but they are still giants and very much alive.
