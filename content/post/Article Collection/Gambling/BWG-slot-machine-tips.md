Beat that Slot Machine

Slot machines are very popular in the casinos. Everybody seems to be drawn by the look and the feel of playing it by spinning the wheel. The thrill of playing a slot machine keeps anyone coming back either they win or not. Here are a few reminders to make your game worthwhile and at the same time increase your chances on hitting the jackpot!


Make sure that you know what machine you are playing. This may sound stupid but there are a lot of players that have missed knowing that they were not able to play the exact amount of coins for the most favorable payment there is.


Be sure to go for the highest reimbursement there is. This is a gamble. There are chances that the fates are on your side. Go ahead, play and win!


Always play the maximum coins. Normally, jackpots are paid on the maximum coins played. This way, not only do you get the chance of hitting the jackpot but also you get a high payback.


Remember to see the payback percentage whether in a casino or online. Some are even offering as high as 90% or more.


Keep in mind how much you are willing to gamble. It is always wise to plan how much you are going to spend. With the thrill of playing and hopes of hitting the jackpot, your money could be gone in seconds.


There are machines that require inexpensive games. These are the single pay line machines. This way, you could still play and have the chance on hitting the jackpot but doesn’t risk of losing all your money.


Try playing on two or three-coin slot machines. This way you could maximize the playing time of your money.


If you have a small budget for playing the slots, avoid playing the progressive slots online. Their payouts are much lower than the regular slot machine does. Plus, they could max out your budget in a few playing minutes.


You hit on jackpot at the first spin. It is likely for you to hope on playing for another round. But as it is, this is a game of chance. You are not sure if you would be hitting on the jackpot the second time or the third, etc. If you win, take the money and quit, don’t fall into giving back the money to the machine.


The rules on beating the slot machine simply works the same way as spinning a regular wheel that has to stop and produce a matching pattern of numbers or pictures in some case. So go ahead, have fun, spin the wheel and hit the jackpot!
