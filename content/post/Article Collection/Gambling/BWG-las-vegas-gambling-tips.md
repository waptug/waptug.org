LAS VEGAS GAMBLING TIPS....WALK OUT A WINNER! 
                                        
Las Vegas, famous for tourism, entertainment and gaming, is "THE" entertainment capital of the world.

In Vegas, playing can be a lot of fun.  Playing can be very easy and winning there, can take little effort too.  But a question to ask is how to leave Las Vegas with money.  This is a deception that gamblers often encounter.

Here are a few general pointers to go home with your winnings:

*Set a rule for the pit games and as much as possible, stick to it.  It could be that you play no pit games at all, or if you should, set a strict budget.  

*Have some rest.  Playing can take place for hours.  If you find yourself losing, stop and have some rest.  Take the time to do other things, like going up to your hotel room to change, watch television, or sleep.  After which you can then go back to the game.  Chances are, the winners have already left and losers are already drunk, so take advantage of the situation!

* Look around and study the players first.  These are unfamiliar faces.  Be attentive as to how they play the game.  Never be hesitant to change tables for better luck, if your game is not going smoothly.  

*When playing thru a slot machine, change your bet every time you spin.  Avoid betting the same amount of coins every spin.  This is good at machines that offer free spins.

*At slots, don't bet on all paylines.  Bet maximum coins on just a few.

*Say no to alcoholic drinks while at play.  When high in alcohol, one tends to have great guts.  Avoid it; you might be very daring as to place a large bet for not so good cards.

*Manage your money well.  Allot a certain amount that you want to play with for the day.  Play the money through the slot machine only once.   After that, take whatever winnings you have or stop if the allotted money is all used up.  If playing pit games, do the same, play within a budget.

*If you lose, you quit, Simple.  You will know your luck as you play along.  If you tend to be losing, don't push it and bet harder hoping you can win and recuperate.
  
But, as in any game, the best strategy is patience.  Watch a while, stand back and study the statistics.  
Gambling above all, whether one be an expert or not, is a game of luck.
