OFFLINE GAMBLING...For richer or poorer                                                   

Gambling is very popular, from way back when, and more so today.  It is a scam itself.  In fact the oldest form known.  Not only a scam, but very deceptive.  Statistics show that about six percent of adults that are involved in gambling are severely addicted to such a "past time" as they call it. People who are hooked on gambling have the urge to bet on almost anything.  From horses, cards, and the casino. The number doesn't end there.  It continues to expand.   

Casino scams are everywhere.  High payouts and promising winnings are put up in huge slogans thereby attracting people who want to earn money the fast, easy and enjoyable way.  A fact is gamblers waste a lot of their time, in the hope of winning.  So they don't give up easily.

Studies show that gambling problems can easily occur in individuals with no self control.  It is necessary for one to identify if he has problems, so it can be identified and acted upon promptly.

Here are some questions one should ask to detect if there is a problem:

* After gambling, when you lose money, be it a small or a large amount, do regret it, or feel resentment?

* When you win, do you have a strong desire to win more, therefore you want to go back?

* When you lose, do you feel a need to go back very soon?

* Do you spend a lot of time gambling, usually longer than what you planned?

*If you have problems, do you gamble to forget them? 

* Are you spending more time gambling than with work?

*Do you not stop until your very last dollar is taken up?

*Do arguments take place between you and your family as a result of your need to gamble?

*To finance your gambling, do you borrow money from friends or associates?

Gambling addiction can be destructive.  Family, friends and your reputation are at risk.  It is a condition often times ignored.  There are escape gamblers that affect seventy five percent of women from their thirties and up.  Usually the reasons for gambling is to escape from the emotional pain that they are in, being bored, lonely, depressed or that they make gambling their hobby or past time.  These types of addiction can be cured in three to six months.

The action gambler is much more difficult to deal.  Most are men, where gambling for them creates ecstasy like a drug addition.  This is much harder to cure, since the individual will deny the fact, when confronted.  They will typically not stop until left with nothing, financially.

As gambling creates a lot of scams, it is a fact that still more and more are drawn to it.  The primary reason is to win a huge amount of money.  But then comes in the most lethal of reasons -- that of feeling a certain euphoria.  Scams or no scams, an individual still continues to gamble and is a reason why offline gambling still thrives today.
