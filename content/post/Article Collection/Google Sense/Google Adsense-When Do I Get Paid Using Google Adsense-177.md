Google Adsense: When Do I Get Paid Using Google Adsense?

Google Adsense pays you approximately 30 days after the end of the month in which you become eligible to receive payment. You become eligible for payment only when your Adsense account reaches at least $100.00.  Suppose, for example, you started in January and at the end of the month you had not yet accumulated $100.00 in your Google Adsense account.  You would then need to wait and see if your January and February earnings combined equal $100.00.  If they do, you would be paid approximately 30 days after the end of the month of February, that is, you could expect payment near the end of March.

Another good reason to also use Adsense for Search is that you get to combine the earnings to reach the $100.00 payout minimum.  So if your earnings for Adsense for Content do not reach $100.00 in time for the current payout, but when combined with your Adsense for Search earnings they do meet the payout minimum, you will be paid accordingly.
