Google Adsense: Rules Surrounding Invalid Clicks and Being in Control

What Is So Important About An Invalid Click and How Will It Affect Me?

More than anything, an invalid click is a big no-no and it will get your account terminated faster than anything else.  Having said that, an invalid click is when a publisher clicks on their own ads to add to their earning potential .  It’s also when a publisher asks others to click on their ads just to raise their revenue.  It also raises the advertiser’s costs and Google won’t tolerate this.  Google Adsense has state of the art technology and they know what’s going on.

Invalid clicks also happen when someone uses robots to click on ads or automated software.  It is any deceptive practice used to click on ads.

Invalid clicks are also unnecessary as there are plenty of money-making opportunities with valid clicks.  With an optimized website, useful content, and attractive ads, there’s no reason for anybody to even entertain the idea of using invalid clicks. 

Having Control Over Your Adsense Account

You the publisher, have complete control over the advertisement that runs on your site.  You can choose to run only image ads, only text ads, or a combination of both.  Google recommends that you choose a combination of both to maximize your earning potential, but the decision is yours.

When making your ad decision, you also have the freedom to choose which type of ads run across your entire account (image or text) or you can narrow that decision to what type of ad might run on a particular page.  

As of right now, you are not able to differentiate your image ad click rate from your text ad click rate.  You can of course, differentiate your click rate from one site as opposed to another site.  Say, for example, you run only image ads on one site and only text ads on another site.  By setting up channels to track both sites, you can see which site has the better click rate.  Of course, you have to take into consideration there would be more factors than whether you were running text or image ads.  The content, the placement of the ads in general, even the color could make a difference.

Refer to the Google Adsense Support Site for specific instructions on how to enable or disable image ads.  Remember, it’s all up to you!
