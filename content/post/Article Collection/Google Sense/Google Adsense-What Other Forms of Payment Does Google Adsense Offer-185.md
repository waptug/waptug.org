Google Adsense: What Other Forms of Payment Does Google Adsense Offer?

You can elect to have your Google Adsense payments mailed to you via check in your local currency.  Google Adsense offers this option in 42 countries.  Check the Google Adsense support center to see if your country is included in this list.

To select receiving your check by postal mail, log in to your Google Adsense account, click the edit link near Payment Details and then click the Check – Standard Delivery radio button.  Then click continue.  Now you can select your currency, if available or you may select US dollars.  When you’re satisfied with your choices, click save settings.

You may also choose to receive your payment through Secured Express Delivery. There is a fee for this service but you can expect to receive your check within 5-10 business days after it has been sent.  If you choose this option, you will need to contact DHL (the courier service) to make sure they offer service to your area and that your address is in the proper format.
