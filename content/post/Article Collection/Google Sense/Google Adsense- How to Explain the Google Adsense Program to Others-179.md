Google Adsense: How to Explain the Google Adsense Program to Others

We’re not talking about strangers here.  For the strangers that visit your site, your content will have to do all the talking for you.  But for the people in your daily life, the ones you want to click on your referral button, the ones you want to read and comment on your blog; these are the ones you want to be able to enlighten about the Google Adsense program.

First, excitement breeds excitement.  Get excited about your new venture and others will too.  Learn everything you can about the Google Adsense program, not only will this increase your earnings, but you’ll be better equipped to explain the mechanics of the program to others.

Show them the money.  There’s nothing like a little proof to make a believer out of someone.  You don’t have to wait until you’re making thousands per month, although that’s a healthy goal.  But even a small deposit in your piggy bank is enough to intrigue most people.  Can’t you just count those referrals now?
