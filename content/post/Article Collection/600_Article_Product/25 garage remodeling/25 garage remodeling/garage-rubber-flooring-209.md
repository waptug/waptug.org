Garage rubber flooring


If you are considering remodeling you garage you might 
consider choosing a rubber flooring for your garage. This 
is an inexpensive option for general purpose flooring: 
most common uses include parking vehicles on the 
rubber flooring, converting the garage space into a play 
area or into a workout room.

Parking your car on a recycled rubber matting is the 
least common use for this product because of two major 
inconveniences: recycled rubber tire products have very 
little resistance to petroleum products so an oil leak could 
seriously damage the floor; the melting point of this type 
of flooring is relatively low, in extreme circumstances the 
heat from the tires can be sufficient to melt the tires into 
the mat.

If planning to remodel for your garage and you 
also have changing the flooring in mind, it is important to 
know the primary function that you need your floor to 
fulfill. If you are going to convert your garage into a dog-
house, the rubber flooring would provide insulation 
against extreme temperatures of the cement as well as an 
extra cushioning. Also you must consider the ease of 
maintenance for this type of flooring.  For a home theater, 
a rubber flooring is desired to reduce the noise 
transmission.
