Your workshop-garage heater


Why do you need a heater for your remodeled garage? 
The answer for this question is pretty obvious: one of the 
major disadvantages of using your garage as a workshop 
or a home office is that it wasn’t meant for that. The 
garage is the special place reserved for your car, the 
garage is the room where you keep your lawn and garden 
accessories. 

If you start using this space for other projects that you 
have, you need to deal with one major inconvenience,
that is warmth. During the summer you don’t have to
worry too much about this but during cold  seasons you
might find some difficulties in continuing your project
because of the very low temperature.

You can find many ways to warm up your workshop-
garage. You can try porcelain heaters; they 
work great and can warm up a good area but they are not 
meant to warm a large space for prolonged periods of time. 

Another solution for you would be to use a kerosene 
heater. These heaters are easy to turn on, most of them 
have an electric starter. It should have a thermostat to be 
able to regulate the temperature also they have a specific 
scent, they do function on kerosene! So if you think you 
cannot handle this smell, a kerosene heater wouldn’t be a 
good choice for you. They are quite dangerous for your 
children, if they have access to the garage and you would 
definitely want to ventilate the garage very well!

A very good and popular choice nowadays is a gas heater. 
Of course you have to hire a professional to install it. You 
can find a gas heater suited to your budget for remodeling 
the garage. There are many models and almost all of them 
are fairly inexpensive. The main advantage of a gas 
heater is that it gives you a consistently warm 
environment. They are available in both manual and 
thermostatic control types. You would probably prefer a 
model that has a thermostat, even though its price is a 
little higher than the price of a manual temperature 
control model. The only thing that you have to do is to set 
it on a desired temperature and leave it to do its job.

There are two types of gas heaters: vented and vent less. 
The vent less unit uses air from the room and the vented 
model has a system that vents directly out of the garage. 
The disadvantage of the vent less model is that you have 
to keep the room vented at all times because the unit uses 
the air from the room where it has been installed. The 
main advantage for the both types of gas heaters is that 
they have a pretty low running cost compared to the 
kerosene and electric heaters.

Remember that if you choose to install a more advanced 
heating system like a gas heater, you must ask for a 
professional’s help.
