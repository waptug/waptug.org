Remodeling ideas for your garage


What is the easiest way to add more space to your house? Of 
course the answer is to remodel your garage. A very cost-effective 
way to gain more space for your house is to remodel your garage. 
You can greatly expand your home’s living space especially if you 
no longer use your garage to park your car using your driveway
instead.  Remodeling your garage can help you become 
more organized and stop storing everything in your garage. This is 
why you have a basement.

Your garage offers a perfect environment to house your workshop, 
studio or home office. Many people also find that their garage 
can also be used for a gym or for another living room designed for 
special activities. However, remodeling your garage does not 
necessarily mean that you have to sacrifice your storage 
space or your parking area. Garages today have become multifunctional, 
allowing cars, general storage, a workshop and even a home office 
all in the same place.

Because many garages are attached to the home they can benefit 
from the same comfort as a home: phone wires, heating and 
cooling and plumbing. All you need is a little imagination, a fixed 
budget and a plan.

If you think that by remodeling you might be losing too much 
storage space, you can always build a small storage space behind 
your garage to house sporting equipment, tools and other items.

Moreover, when remodeling your garage you should consider an 
addition above the garage. Adding a room for work space and even 
for living, for one of your kids(they usually love this) above the 
existing garage can give you additional space and also increase the 
value of your home without major changes to the floor plan.

If you feel the need to remodel your garage but you don’t know 
exactly what you want or need, you should consider the following 
ideas.

You can transform your garage into a laundry room if you have your 
laundry room in the basement. By building a laundry in your 
garage you will eliminate the need to go up and down the stairs.

A music studio can be a great choice for your garage remodeling 
plans if you or your kids have some tendencies in this direction. 
The garage is the place where many “garage bands” got their start. 
To avoid your neighbors’ complaints consider soundproofing your 
garage walls. 

Another idea for your garage can be to transform it into a gym. If 
you have your equipment and you don not have enough place to 
use it indoors you can always move it into the garage and have 
plenty of place for your daily exercises and training. Also here you 
will not be bothered by anyone.
