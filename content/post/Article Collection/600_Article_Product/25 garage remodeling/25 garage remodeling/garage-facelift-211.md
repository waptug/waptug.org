Garage facelift 


You would probably ask yourself why do you need a facelift for 
your garage. It is only a garage! But what if you have a 
two or more cars garage? The garage doors take up a 
significant portion of the front of the house. What is the use in 
having a great design for your house but having only generic 
garage doors? 

Nowadays the garage door trends are to incorporate the doors 
into the design of the house. For example you could choose 
carriage-style doors(look like they open like old-fashioned 
doors in carriage houses, but they open like normal garage 
doors) or you could choose wood carriage doors. These wood 
carriage doors are reminiscences of the horse-drawn carriage days 
and they are very popular. You donâ€™t need to go as far as to 
order custom made garage doors because you can find more 
appealing garage doors at most home improvement stores.

In addition to the doors, the floor of a garage gives style and can 
integrate to the overall aesthetics of your house. You could try 
interlocking garage floor tiles that come in multiple colors and 
patterns. They are made of polypropylene and are easy to 
install and clean. Another interesting and practical flooring is the 
coin shaped G-flooring.
