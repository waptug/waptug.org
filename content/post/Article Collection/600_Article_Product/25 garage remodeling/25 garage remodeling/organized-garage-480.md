Organized garage 


The garage is that one place where we all seem to love to be 
disorganized, however the sooner you get organized, the sooner 
you can make better use of that space. Organizing your garage 
can be a tiresome task for many homeowners. When you think 
about organizing your garage you should keep in mind that this 
activity means to find a designated place for everything while 
keeping your goods available for everyday use. The following 
five steps compromise a simple system for garage organization.

Sort your garage items.
First of all sort and categorize all the items in your garage, for 
this you should empty your garage and start sorting everything 
into categories. Separate the tools from sporting equipment, 
electric tools, etc. You will realize how much stuff you have 
and only then you will be able to determine the best ways to 
organize and store everything.  Misplaced items in your garage 
should be returned to their proper place. Also you should sort 
the things that should be in the garage from the things that 
should actually be in the basement, attic or better, sold at a 
garage sale. Remember to recycle everything that you decide to 
throw away.

Separate seasonal items and equipment.
A special rack should be installed to hang lawn maintenance 
tools and to keep them accessible yet out of the way. If it is 
near winter place snow related tools like snow blowers, ice 
scrapers, snow shovels and also skis, snowboards and sleds 
grouped together. Also the items for warm seasons should be 
stored in a special cabinet. Near the beginning of every season 
you should plan this activity and rotate the cold and warm 
items places in the cabinet. For the other sporting equipment, 
shelves and drawers should be designed. 

Additional shelving and cabinets.
While organizing you should consider adding additional 
garage storage space to help you maintain the organization. 
Shelves and cabinets should be mounted on the walls. The 
basic principle is to store the items that you use on a regular 
basis in a way that makes them accessible every time you need 
them.

Create efficient working area.
Installing a bench or a table would be a good choice if you use 
your garage as a workshop. A sturdy tool chest and a pegboard 
are great in storing your tools and keeping them easily 
accessible.

Relocate trash and recycling bins nearby the garage. 
To easily dispose unwanted items from your garage a good 
idea is to relocate the trash and recycling bins near to your 
garage entrance.  This way you wonâ€™t be tempted to keep 
certain items because the trash bins are too far away.

Now would be the time to hire a handyman to have cabinets, 
closets and shelves built right into your garage. Invest in some 
good storage units as described before and start organizing, 
sorting and storing.
