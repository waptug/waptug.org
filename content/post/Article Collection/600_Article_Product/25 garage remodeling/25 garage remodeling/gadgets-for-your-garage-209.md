Gadgets for your garage


If you spend a lot of your time at home in your garage or if 
you want a clean and organized garage you need a few
gadgets. Garage gadgets come in many forms and for different 
purposes.

For example a stop light for parking may come in handy for 
someone who has a problem with depth perception or for 
someone who comes home late from work and is very tired. If you 
have such problems, you need this tool. It is easy to install 
and use and it helps you to park the car in the same spot 
every time when the motion sensors are triggered.

If you need space on the walls next to the door, you can 
mount a garage door opener on the ceiling above the door
to eliminate chains. 

Bike storage is ideal in a garage for “hanging” your bike on a 
wall so you have easy access to it with the advantage of having 
more clear space in the garage.

If you have a lot more items in your garage than you really have
Room for or the walls are full of shelves and cabinets, you
definitely need additional storage devices like an overhead
storage system mounted directly on the ceiling.
