Safety A Garage Necessity


What do you see when you first examine a garage? 

The garage door. This is the first and most important “contact” of 
your garage to the world. If you want full confidence in your 
garage, this “contact” should be 100% secure and safe. Also the 
door says a lot of you and of your taste in design. You can have a 
beautiful house but if your garage door is a wooden, plain, 
white one with that makes an awful sound when opened or 
closed, says a lot of you and your negligence regarding style and 
safety.

An ageing garage door and opener could be a real threat for 
your children or pets. Injuries and death are a thing of the past 
with the new openers and garage doors. If you plan to remodel 
your garage, one of the first steps in doing this must be changing 
your doors and openers.

Old garage doors have been heavy, huge, wooden colossus that 
rot and crack. Even though wooden doors provide a wide range 
of styles and textures the problems related to poor insulation are 
real and even of present times. An alternative is the fiberglass 
material, inexpensive, easy to lift, resistant to corrosion and the 
require little maintenance but they also provide little insulation 
and security.

If you want a maintenance-free, durable and not-wrapping garage 
door you need steel. They also provide good insulation, being 
made of two or more sheets of steel alternating with a variety of 
insulating materials. The also come in various textures, styles, 
shapes and colors suited to your needs. Moreover, you can add 
windows including the reflective type that provide an obscure 
view into the garage.

In 1991, automatic reversal doors for garage door openers have 
been required by law in the United States and in since 1993 
optical sensors became a requirement. The sensor works perfect 
for your safety: if something gets in the way of the sensor beam 
while the door is going down, the sensor sends the door back up. 
Also the new design provides more security and quieter 
operation. Today, the silence options include a belt-driven trolley 
made of Kevlar or, the cheaper option, a screw-drive model with 
a plastic-lined track to lessen the noisy contact of metal-to-metal.

Remote controls have been upgraded so you can find a 
remote control having enough buttons to control the lightening or 
appliances in your home and garage. Another option for your 
remote-control buttons are the child-safe lock-out and the rolling 
security codes witch automatically change every time the garage 
door opens to prevent the stealing of your opener’s code.

Even though you have all these changes added to your garage, 
security and safety are not 100% guaranteed.  It is better that the 
installation of a new garage door and opener be done by a 
professional team who can make the proper adjustments that will 
allow the sensitive equipment to provide you with the maximum 
amount of safety in your garage.
