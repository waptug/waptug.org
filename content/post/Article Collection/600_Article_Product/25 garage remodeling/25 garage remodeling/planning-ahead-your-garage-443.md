Planning ahead your garage


What would your dream garage look like? Some people want 
to have it fitted for the car, others dream for a really nice 
workshop, a laundry room, a gym or a rehearsal studio for their 
own musical band. Some other people only want it to expand their 
living space and improve their lifestyle.

How much money do you have to work with? Even if you want 
only to remodel, rebuild or only reorganize a small area of your 
garage you must have a budget. It is imperative to have in mind a 
specific target and a realistic and finite budget for it.

The first step is to carefully evaluate your needs regarding the 
space and your needs. Even if it is a small garage, you can find 
plenty of space to use for your work area.

Making the decision regarding whether to do the project 
yourself or to hire a contractor depends on several factors, 
including your skills and the magnitude of the project. Having 
only basic skills you can produce a great reorganization project.
 
You can buy the needed furniture yourself according to your 
needs and your available space. Cabinets, shelves, pegs and 
hooks are a must have in order to turn your garage into usable 
space over a weekend. If you have a greater project in mind, 
maybe you should consult a plumber or an electrician.

If you are planning to convert your garage into a living area 
you’d better be a professional or you’ll be risking decreasing 
the safety and value of your own home.

If you opt for a contractor, and this is the choice that we 
recommend regardless of the project’s magnitude or your skills, 
get one whose work you’ve seen and if you have the chance, 
get some recommendations. It is better to see with your 
own eyes the skills and some relevant work of the contractor so 
you can decide whether you could be satisfied with his work or 
not.

Costs and construction times vary with the scope and the 
magnitude of the project. If there are no structural issues, 
finishing and enclosing a garage and turning it into useable room 
would take less than two weeks. The costs depend on the 
materials that you decide to use, but keep in mind that expensive 
does not necessary mean quality and that cheap does not grant you 
reliability every time. 

Your garage can be a place to spend many happy hours for a long 
time to come if you plan it right according to your needs and 
dreams.
