Common Services offered by Pre-paid legal Plans

Considering a pre-paid legal plan? He’s a run-down of the services 
you’re most likely to get and also some legal documents you need to sign
before you enrol. 

Telephone and Office Consultation: You have unlimited telephone access to 
a panel of attorneys regarding any legal matter of interest to you. You 
can also make brief consultation visits to your lawyer for up to 30 
minutes per day at no cost to you. 
The only condition placed on these two benefits is that you enquire about 
a different legal matter. 
This aspect of coverage provided by legal plans is one of the most 
beneficial because it promotes preventive law. Preventive law is very much 
like preventive medicine – it helps in anticipating potential problems and 
taking the appropriate legal steps so that unnecessary legal problems or 
risks are avoided. With a simple phone call to your lawyer you can avoid 
getting embroiled in a hellish legal situation, and you can even identify 
legal rights you don’t even know you had.  

Follow-Up Service: The panel of lawyers will write letters and make phone 
calls on your behalf to adverse third parties. Such follow-up service may 
be all it takes to solve many of your legal problems. 

Legal document review: Simple personal legal documents, such as your 
insurance policies, sales contracts and leases will be reviewed. Any 
questions of legal nature that you have about the documents will also get 
answered by your attorney. 

Drafting of wills: A will is a written document that regulates how you want 
your property distributed after your death. Your attorney will draft your 
will according to your state’s laws so that it’s valid when you die. He 
will also advise you on any provisions you might want to consider, such as 
appointing a guardian and establishing a trust. 

Discount on regular fees: Any additional services not covered in the 
written fee agreement will be at regular fees – either hourly or flat – 
with a discount between 20 to 30%. These services generally include family 
matters, such as divorce and the custody of children, and court 
representation, such as traffic tickets and lawsuits. 

Some of the legal paperwork you need to read carefully, agree on and sign 
include the following:

Written fee agreement: This is an agreement that outlines what services are 
provided in the plan, how much it costs and the methods of payment.

Grievance procedure: This document details the procedures that will be 
taken by the provide to resolve any complaints about attorneys or disputes 
regarding service fees.
