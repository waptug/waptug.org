Why you need legal help

We are likely to need legal help at least once a year, yet most of us do 
not actively seek legal help. 

This is borne out of data from a survey 
conducted by Leo J. Shapiro & Associates, on behalf of the American Bar 
Association’s Section of Litigation, which shows that close to three 
quarters of American adults experience some event during a twelve-month 
period that may require the services of a lawyer. Over half of those who 
needed an attorney chose not to hire one, and close to 80% of those yet to 
experience legal problems gave strong indications they might go down the 
same route. 

Why all the doom and gloom? Price is the most sticking point 
for most consumers. When it comes to hiring a lawyer, hourly fees of $100 
up to $1000 are out of reach of most people’s budget. And then comes the 
trepidation of searching for a good attorney and the right service: there 
is a lot of uncertainty and confusion as what a lawyer will do, and how to 
tell the good from the bad. 

A legal plan may solve these problems and change the way you think of legal 
services. Thanks to this arrangement, you can now talk to a lawyer whenever 
you have a problem, without fear this will leave you out of pocket. In 
fact, you don’t even need to be embroiled in a legal problem to get legal 
advice:  just pick up the phone, call your attorney and get the necessary 
legal advice susceptible of resolving any potential problems –with 
professional legal advice and follow-up, you can prevent ninety percent of 
your legal questions becoming legal problems. Basic services such as the 
drafting of your will, review of sample health contracts and writing 
letters on your behalf are handled at no cost to you. If you want further 
coverage to include family problems, such as a divorce or custody of 
children, and any legal representation in court, then you simply pay a 
premium and get more inclusive coverage.
 
Even if your plan doesn’t cover complex legal matters, it can still save 
you money on those sky-high attorney fees. Discounts of up to 20% are 
offered on hourly and flat rates. Ultimately, it’s not all down to how much 
you can save. Having an attorney readily available at all times gives you 
peace of mind, in the knowledge that there is someone you can use on 
retainer for advice and help on anything of legal nature.
