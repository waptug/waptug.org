Who regulates pre-paid legal plans?

Pre-paid legal service providers are required to provide either a written 
agreement of the services provided in their plans, or at least a written 
communication concerning the services covered, together with the fees to 
be charged for services not covered in the written agreement of membership.
 
However, most people gloss over “terms and conditions” and just sign the 
agreement assuming they are covered for most legal services. This usually 
gives rise to frequent complaints about the service, fee disputes and 
complaints about attorneys. 

Generally, if you have any complaint with your service, you should first 
address any such complaint with your service provider. Contact them to get 
information regarding their in-house complaint process and settlement of 
disputes. If you are unsatisfied, then it helps to know who regulates your 
kind of legal insurance.

Your state’s Department of consumer affairs licenses and regulates all 
pre-paid legal plans. Prepaid legal service companies are required to 
register with the department prior to commencing business and appoint a 
sales representative. Further regulation can be provided by your local bar 
association.
