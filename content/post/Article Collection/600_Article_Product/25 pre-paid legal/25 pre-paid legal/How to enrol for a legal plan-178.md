How to enrol for a legal plan? 

Are you thinking of getting on the pre-paid bandwagon? Choosing a 
particular enrolment method can be very important in determining the 
benefits, costs and conditions of coverage of your legal plan. 

A voluntary enrolment refers to a membership of a legal plan where people 
“voluntarily” subscribe to a pre-paid legal service in response to a direct 
email offer, during an employer’s open enrolment period or during 
individual sales representations. In this arrangement, you pay the prepaid 
charge, get the standard discounts open to all other members of the plan 
and get the coverage as per the terms and conditions of the plan.

In a group plan, all members are automatically included in the plan because 
of their status as a group. For instance, many employees enjoy a 100% 
participation in legal plans sponsored by their employers. They do not have 
to pay any pre-paid charge or premium, as legal coverage in the work place 
is now regarded as an employee fringe-benefit. 
Some universities also provide legal coverage for their students, financing 
the plans from their general tuition fees.
