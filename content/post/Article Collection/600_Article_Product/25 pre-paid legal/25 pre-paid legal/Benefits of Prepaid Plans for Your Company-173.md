Benefits of Pre-paid legal plan for your company

Employers are on the hunt - researching benefit tools that are low-cost, 
easily administered and satisfy their employees’ needs.  One such tool is 
pre-paid group insurance. We examine the benefits of having such a 
work-benefit option from an employer’s perspective.
 
The first benefit employers expect from legal insurance plans is increased 
productivity and efficiency. Today’s employees are interested in a variety 
of benefits to balance their work with their life requirements. Given that 
most American household had an issue with law last year that might have led 
them to hire a lawyer, it’s only normal that a legal benefit would increase 
employees’ morale and efficiency.

Having legal benefit as part of a work-benefit package can help the company 
recruit and retain the best employees. In this age of work-benefit 
hysteria, many prospective employment candidates base their career choices 
on the set of benefit package provided by employers. 

Cost containment is another benefit. With less time and resources to be 
used for personal matters, the company expects to make significant savings 
on administrative costs.
