Group Legal plans benefits for employer and employee

A properly developed group legal insurance plan can be the perfect 
complement to any employerâ€™s work life initiative. Considering that many 
employees are nowadays increasingly swayed by benefit options when making 
career decisions, Legal insurance is a viable product for many employers. 

However, there is no single fit-for-all group legal plan for all 
organizations. For a start, each organization has a distinct list of 
requirements when contracting for legal insurance. A requirement built on 
the premise of reduced administrative costs will require a different set 
of legal services than requirements built on enhancing a benefits package 
or protect against liability.
Legal plans also vary in what they offer: the quality of their customer 
service, flexibility of plan design and finally the experience and 
professional track record of their panel of attorneys. 

In order to minimize the risk of poor service and plummeting employer 
satisfaction, an employer should conduct both requirements analysis 
amongst its employee base to cover for their difference needs, and a due 
research to select the most appropriate legal plan to fit those 
requirements based on experience, integrity and track record.
