Benefits of Pre-paid legal plans

Pre-paid legal services can be a very attractive alternative to hiring a 
lawyer for many people. You should consider the importance and relative 
priority of these benefits in light of your own legal needs. 
So what are the benefits going pre-paid compared to conventional hire of 
lawyers?

Benefit Number 1: Cost-Effective

Pre-paid legal plans can take the sting out of hiring a lawyer. Lawyers’ 
fees are prohibitive for most people: you can run bills of thousands of 
dollars and this is simply out of reach of most working and middle-class 
families.
With pre-paid plans, what you get charged is more in line with what you 
pay for your health or home insurance. Plans start as low as $9 per month 
and typically don’t exceed the $30 mark.

Benefit Number 2: Simplicity 

There is a number of very complicated set of fees lawyers charge: 
contingency fees, flat fees, statutory fees and hourly rates. In the case 
of contingency and statutory fees, you have to get into the intricate 
details of how these fees are computed – say for a contingency fee how 
much is the lawyer’s commission? – and their regulatory nature  – who 
regulates the statutory fee and how do I know if these fees are in line 
with regulatory guidelines?-. 
The other two types of fees can be equally as complex. Increasingly, 
attorneys choose to incorporate any overheads they incur, like secretarial 
expenses, parking charges and travel fees into their flat and hourly fees. 
They can also set a minimum number of billing units, like three tenths of 
an hour (18 minutes), irrespective of how long it takes them to deal with 
your problem. 
This is just a sample rundown of what might influence the various fees 
charged by lawyers, other factors and arrangements can apply too. Contrast 
this with the simplicity in which pre-paid legal services are priced and 
furnished. The process is simple and straightforward: you sign an agreement 
to pay a fixed monthly fee and that’s about it. If what you’re looking for 
is not covered, your plan provider will give you a prior notice of a 
different billing so that you know exactly how much you will be charged. 

Benefit Number 4: Pre-emptive Law

Pre-paid plans offer unlimited phone consultation and advice. This aspect 
of the service can save you a lot of trouble, money and time in the 
future. Most legal problems you are likely to face in your day-to-day life 
can be solved if you take the necessary steps in line with the law. With 
the right advice and consultation with your lawyer, you can detect legal 
blunders before they occur and hence minimize the risk of litigation and 
protection.
