Porsche Boxter


The Porsche Boxster and Boxster S are fast, powerful cars and most 
of all the best-handling production roadsters on the planet. 
Introduced in 1996, it remained essentially unchanged, other than 
moderate horsepower and interior-options tweaks. That’s what 
Porsche usually does with the successful models: it retains car 
look and configuration for ages. 
	
A more powerful second-generation Boxster was introduced in 2005 
and it keeps Porsche’s conservative evolutionary path. Like its 
precedent, it is a mid-engine, six-cylinder two-seater that looks like 
Porsche Spyder.  Still, over half of Boxster`s structure and electronics 
are borrowed from the 911 Carrera. 
	
The 2005 Boxster looks sprightlier than its 2004 equivalent, thanks 
to the revision of the torque and the 15 added hp and the extra power
coming on strongly between 2000rpm and 4000 rpm. The 2005 
Boxster S virtually equals the acceleration and top-speed performance 
of Porsche's expensive 911 Carrera. The Boxster exhaust has been
tuned to play a distinctive tromboning wail like no other car. This is a 
amazing thing thinking that both engines are smaller versions of the 
six-cylinder in the Carrera. 

The transmission for base Boxters is five-speed manual but the optional 
variant offers a six-speed.  Both models can also be fitted with a 
five-speed Tiptronic, the superb Porsche-designed automatic transmission
that began the trend toward manually shifted automatics.

The bodywork and the interior of the Boxster are of high quality, but considering 
that there’s noting tricky or purely decorative, we can definitely say that 
these are not opulent cars. Still, the interior has been improved since the 
old car was often criticized for being to cheap-looking. The center console 
has been upgraded with revised switch-gear and titanium look paneling. 
The seats are more supportive and body-shaped in the new version, 
making them look absolutely superb. Unlike other roadsters, the Boxster 
has no problem swallowing luggage for a long trip: it has two trunks, a 
small one in the rear and an amply deep one under the front hood. 

One of The Boxster`s best qualities is the powered convertible top, very quick 
to retract or re-erect. In the new Boxster, the top can be operated at speeds 
up to 30 mph. The triple-layer padded cloth tops (with a heated-glass rear 
window) is as weather-tight and quiet as most metal roofs.

The Boxster is called a mid engine-car. The reason is that the sweet six-cylinder 
engine is mounted behind the seats, just fore of the rear axle. So if you wand
to see what’s under the hood once in while, well…you can’t do that with The Boxster. 
The only way to see the engine is from underneath or by meticulously removing 
body panels, which mechanics must do to service the engine. But, the good 
news is that having the engine mounted closer to the center of the car makes 
for better weight distribution. And that’s what makes the car handle so well.
