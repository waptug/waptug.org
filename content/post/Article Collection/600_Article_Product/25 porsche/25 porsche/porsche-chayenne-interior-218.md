Porsche Chayenne interior


Porsche offers three versions of the four-door Cayenne: the Cayenne, 
The Cayenne S and the Cayenne Turbo. The standard models of the Cayenne 
and Cayenne S come with features such as: 18-inch alloy wheels, 
stability control given by the Porsche Stability Management, leather 
seating, power seats, dual-zone automatic climate control and a 
350-watt, 15-speaker Bose audio system. Since it’s a true Porsche, 
Cayenne’s ignition switch is on the dash’s left side. The gauge 
cluster is nearly perfect but the climate and radio controls are 
indecipherable cluster of buttons and knobs. The good thing is that 
the satellite steering wheel controls are standard which means that 
they will be easier to find. The Turbo model comes not only with 
additional power but also with more technical and luxury features.
 
Among those we enumerate: an adaptive suspension with automatic 
ride height and damping adjustment (Porsche Active Suspension 
Management), bi-HID headlights, a CD-based navigation system, 
heated seats front and rear, seat memory, sonar front/rear parking 
assist and power adjustment for the steering wheel. But the options 
the Cayenne offers are meant to increase functionality and personality. 
These options are: four-zone climate control, bolstered sport seats, 
various wheel/tire upgrades and trailering preparation. With a maximum 
cargo capacity of 63 cubic feet, the Cayenne has slightly more capacity 
than the Range Rover but less than the Infiniti FX45.
