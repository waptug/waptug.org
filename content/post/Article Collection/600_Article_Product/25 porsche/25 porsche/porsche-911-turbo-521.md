Porsche 911 Turbo

In 2006, Dr. Ing. H.c. Porsche will extend it’s current product 
line with the addition of a new 911 Turbo, the sixth generation 
of the 911 series. This top-of-the-range model will have its world 
premiere at the Geneva Motor Show on February 28, 2006 and 
as from June 24, 2006 it will be available in German dealerships.
	
The 911 Turbo (type 997) has a few improvements. It has an 
output of 480 bhp at 6,000 rpm, a 3.6 litre engine, a rated torque 
of 620 Nm and a maximum torque available between 1,950 and 
5,000 rpm. All these numbers are translated into driving 
performance, as the 911 Turbo with six-speed manual transmission 
only needs 3.9 seconds to get from zero to 100 km/h. The coupe 
reaches 200 km/h in 12.8 seconds. Despite these performance 
statistics, Porsche developers succeeded to keep the average
consumption to 12.8 liters per100 km.
	
For those who need even more speed, the 911 Turbo offers the 
optionally Tiptronic S automatic transmission. This way, it can reach 
100 km/h from a standing start in just 3.7 seconds and 200 km/h in 
a mere 12.2 seconds. Both manual and automatic transmissions 
have a top speed of 310 km/k. Available for the first time, the optional
 “Sport Chrono Package Turbo” enhances the vehicle’s flexibility even 
further. 
	
The Porsche 911 Turbo features a redesigned all-wheel drive with 
an electronically controlled multi-disc clutch. The result will be the 
transfer of the available power to the road. That’s because, depending
on the driving conditions, this system will determine the optimal torque 
distribution to ensure the best-possible drive.  Also, Porsche Traction 
Management (PTM) ensures variable power distribution to the two 
driven axles. This means that on the road the 911Turbo will prove 
outstanding traction in the rain or snow, high agility on narrow country 
roads and optimal active safety even at high speeds.

The new 911 Turbo’s driving performance is duly tempered by its brake 
system, which comprises monobloc fixed-caliper disc brakes with six 
pistons at the front axle and four at the rear. The diameter of the internally
ventilated and perforated brake discs at the front and rear wheels is 350 
millimeters. An optimized ceramic brake system that Porsche offers is 
Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake (PCCB). This high-tech system 
reduces with 17 kilograms the standard brake system and provides an
excellent fading stability. 

The major bodywork change of the 911 Turbo is the modified front end with 
its distinctive, tautly drawn cooling air inlets. Combined with the standard 
oval bi-xenon headlights, it will define the new unmistakable image. From 
the rear perspective too, the Turbo will seem more powerful. This is due
first and foremost to its tail end, 22 millimeters wider than that of the previous 
model, to which the redesigned wing spoiler element has been aligned. 

Secondly, the lateral air inlets behind the doors have been redrawn and now 
they offer a more efficient supply of cooling air to the charge-air intercoolers. 

The basic price for the 911 Turbo is 115,000 Euros. In the USA, from July 
8, 2006, the vehicle will be available at $122,000 (not including taxes).
