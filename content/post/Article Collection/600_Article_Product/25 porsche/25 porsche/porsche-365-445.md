Porsche 365


The Porsche 356 is the first Porsche production automobile 
and it was sold from 1948 through 1965.  Although many 
consider Porsche 64 as being the first automobile produced 
by the German company, the 64 was never mass-produced 
and it was only a drivable test-mule. The 364 was created by 
Ferdinand Porsche and his son, Ferry Porsche, designed by 
Erwin Komenda and its engine features derived from the 
Volkswagen Beetle, deigned by Mr. Porsche Senior.

The models available were initially coupe, cabriolet (luxury 
convertible) and then roadster (a stripped down convertible).
Before being withdrawn in 1965, it went through several 
changes. The most desirable versions were 356 “Carrera” 
(often sold for well over $150,000), “Super 90” and “Speedster”. 
In the late 50`s, the original selling price for a Porsche was 
$4,000.

In 1954, Max Hoffman, the only importer of Porsches into 
United States needed a lower cost, racier version for the 
American marker. Therefore, the company created 356 
“Speedster” that became a instant hit thanks to the low, raked 
windshield (easily removable for weekend racing), bucket seats, 
and minimal folding top. These days, this car is still very 
appreciated as it is sold for over $100,000 and it has been used 
in several films, including 48 Hours, its sequel – Another 48 
Hours and Top Gun. In 1957, the production of Speedster 
peaked at 1,171 cars. In 1959 it was replaced by the Convertible 
D model, which featured a taller, more practical windshield, 
glass side windows, and more comfortable seats.

Year after year, the basic shape of Porsche 356 remained the 
same and was easily recognized and remarked, even though 
changes were made, especially in the mechanical area. Coupe 
and cabriolet models were produced every year up to 1965, 
with the last 356B Roadster built in early 1963. The final model
build was 356 C that featured disc brakes and the most 
powerful pushrod engine Porsche so far: the 95HP “SC”.

In the year that Porsche launched 911, 1964, Porsche 356 production 
peaked at 14,151 cars. Still, the company continued to sell the 
356C in North America through the end of 1965 as a lower-cost 
vehicle. When the customers complained the price for 911 was 
too high (almost twice the price of the 356), Porsche started 
producing the 912, using the 356 engine. The 912model was 
sold between 1965 and 1969.

56 years after the beginning of the production, Sports Car 
International named 356C number ten on the list of Top Sports 
cars of the 60`s. Today, the 356 is a respected car among the 
collectors, as it stood the test of time. Worldwide, thousands of 
356 owners maintain the tradition, preserving their cars and 
driving them regularly.
