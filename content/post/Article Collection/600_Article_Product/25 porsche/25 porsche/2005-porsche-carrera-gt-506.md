2005 Porsche Carrera GT


Unofficially, the Porsche Carrera GT is a racecar, a racecar
built for the street. What makes it a racecar is not 
necessarily the huge power produced by its V10 engine 
or the carbon fiber construction that keeps everything very 
lightweight – although these features surely make it a fast 
car. It’s more the sum of its parts that make this car worth 
every bit of its $440,000 price tag.

The Porsche Carrera GT was introduced as a 2004 model 
and until 2005 there were already a few changes in order 
to make the Carrera GT the new Porsche super car. These were 
minor updates in order to make it a little more street friendly. 
Between the supplemental bar hoops is now mounted a glass 
screen. The seats height is adjusted along with the additional 
bolstering in the thigh area. The Carrera GT is easy recognizable, 
as it’s a low, sleek, lightweight roadster, very beautiful on the
outside as it is on the inside. Two removable panels that can
be stored in the front trunk make the foul weather protection 
available.

The car has unique features, among which are: 5.7 liter, 605 
horsepower V10 engine, monocoque chassis with 
Porsche-patented engine and transmission mounts made of 
carbon-reinforced plastic and the first use of a ceramic 
composite clutch in a production car. A very important aspect 
is that The Carrera is safe and stable at speeds up to 205 mph, 
thanks to its aerodynamic and race-bred suspension package. 

The design of the suspension is so sophisticated that the 
shape of its components improves the Carrera GT`s aerodynamics.
The designers used lightweight materials such as magnesium 
for the car’s substantial wheels and the frames of its special sport 
seats, the result being a faster and safer car. To prove so, The 
Carrera GT accelerates from a standing start to 62 mph (100km/h) 
in only 3.9 seconds reaches 100 mph (160 km/h) in less than seven 
seconds, 125 mph (200 km/h) in less than 10 seconds, and can 
achieve a top test-track speed of 205 mph (330 km/h).

What makes this car have these impressive results is it’s 5.5 
liter, normally aspirated V10 engine for racing created in the 
development center in Weissach, Germany. That engine’s bores 
have been enlarged to displace 5.7 liters in the Carrera GT. It has 
a very low center of gravity, a 68-degree V angle and four 
valves-per-cylinder heads. Since the block, crankshaft and 
camshafts are all made of light alloys, the engine weights 
only 472 pounds (214 kg).

To stop this “monster” Porsche`s team used a high-tech 
braking system. Developed for demanding motorsports 
applications, ceramic brakes are the first to work for on-road use.
The massive 15 inch ventilated discs and six-piston calipers have
the amazing capacity of bringing the car to a sure and safe stop,
matched only by the stunning acceleration of Carrera GT.

Porsche Carrera GT is definitely a exotic appearance, a 
car that can do it all: fascinate you with its good looks,   astound
 you with its performance and abilities on the race track.
