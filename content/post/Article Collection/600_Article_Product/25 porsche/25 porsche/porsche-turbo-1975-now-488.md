Porsche turbo 1975 - now


In 1975 Porsche introduced the first Turbo. The engineers 
experienced this new engine and Chairman Ernst Fuhrman 
decided that they could use a turbo on a production car. The 
first prototype was displayed at several European shows in 
1973. In 1974, “911 Turbo” went on sale and at the time it had 
a 3.0 liter 260 bhp engine.
	
The new Porsche was full of luxury. The standard Turbo had 
air-conditioning, electric windows, tinted glass, headlamp washers, 
a leather interior and Bilstein shocks. Originally, it was supposed 
to be a limited edition, with only 500 models to be sold. However, 
the demand was so high that more than 1000 cars were sold. It was 
now clear that Turbo would have a secure future.
	
What attracted so many customers was its huge rear wing, widened 
wheel and big tires. This great look combined with the powerful engine 
made the Turbo look faster than any other 911.
	
In 1978, the model was improved by the increase of the engine 
capacity to 3.3 liter and some other modifications. Now the engine 
produced 40 bhp more. The rear wing was also revised: the two 
separate grilles were replaced by one larger smooth surface, placed 
a little higher in order to make room for an intercooler. 
	
In 1979 though, the Turbo was withdrawn from US and Japan, as a 
response to the second energy crunch.
	
In 1986, Turbo became again available in the US. This was the first 
year Porsche used flares that were created in the stamping – process 
of the fenders.  In 1992 Porsche showed the Turbo S at Geneva's 
Motorshow. It’s engine delivered 381 bhp. The car weighted 120 
kg less then the standard Turbo and this helped making Turbo S 
really fast. There were built only 80 Turbo S.
	
In 1993, the engine capacity was increased again, now reaching 3.6 
liter.  It was easily recognized by the Turbo 3.6 badge. Also, there was
a 93 Turbo 3.6 based 911 Turbo S built.
	
In 1996 Porsche launched yet another Turbo, based on the 993 series. 
Its engine produced 408 bhp, featuring a six-speed gearbox and 
four-wheel drive. It looked more elegant thanks to the less evocative 
rear-wing. The wheels are 18 inch in diameter. It saves 20% of the 
weight because the five spokes are hollow. The front wing has 
air-ducts that lead extra cooling air to the brakes, making them more 
powerful than before. They can stop the Turbo from 100 hm/h in 2.6 
seconds and from 200km/h in just 5 seconds, increasing car’s safety. 
	
Porsche has recently introduced the 996 Turbo. The styling is different 
from the previous Turbo models. Its aerodynamics are improved, making 
it much faster than the 993 Turbo. It gets to 100 km/h in only 4.2 
seconds and has a top speed of 305 km/h. The new Turbo has a few 
details that make it easy to recognize: bi-xenon headlights, air intakes 
behind the doors and a movable rear-spoiler.
