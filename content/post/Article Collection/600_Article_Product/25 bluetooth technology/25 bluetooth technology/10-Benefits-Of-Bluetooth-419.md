push any buttons.  When two or more devices enter 
a range of up to 30 feet of each other, they will
automatically begin to communicate without you

a high level of compatibility among devices is 
guaranteed.  Bluetooth will connect devices to
each other, even if they aren't the same model.

from other wireless devices.  Bluetooth uses a 
technique known as frequency hopping, and also 
low power wireless signals.

the technology requires very little energy and will
use less battery or electrical power as a result.
This is an excellent benefit for mobile devices, 
as Bluetooth won't drain the battery.

devices to share data and voice communications.

You can connect up to seven Bluetooth devices to
each other within a range of up to 30 feet, forming
a piconet or PAN.  For a single room, you can
also set up multiple piconets.

are newer versions of Bluetooth in the works, 
which offer many new advantages and backward 
compatible with older versions.

Bluetooth technology is a world wide, universal
wireless standard.  With it being as popular as
it is, you can count on it being around for years
to come.  As more and more devices start to use
Bluetooth technology, more manufacturers will be
eager to make their products compatible.  A chain
reaction will occur, making Bluetooth the standard
for cutting edge wireless.
