Autoresponders – 
The More You Know, The More Effective They Are

If you have signed up with an autoresponder service, 
you need to take the time to read the instructions to 
learn how to use the service – before you load the 
first word of your first message! Not knowing how to 
use the service will lead to many mistakes, and 
your customers and potential customers will most 
likely see every mistake you make!

As soon as you have complete the sign up process, 
load one email address into the autoresponders 
mailing list – yours. If there is a manual or help file 
for your autoresponder, read every word of it, and 
really learn how to use all of the features of the 
autoresponder. 

Work with it, sending messages to your own address, 
until you know your autoresponder service inside and 
out! This may take a little time, but after a few hours 
or so, you should know all that there is to know, and 
you will be able to set your autoresponders up much 
more effectively in the future. Taking the time to learn 
now, will not only save time in the future, it may also 
help you tweak and tune your autoresponder 
messages and tracking in a way that increases your 
responses!
