Autoresponder Access to Secret Pages

People love to have access to things that other 
people can’t get. It makes them feel special, and it 
is a marketing tactic that really works. Granting
access to secret pages works well on the Internet. 
It works best when it is limited. For instance, you 
can grant access to only a lucky few, or you can 
have a time limit for accessing the pages. You can 
grant access to secret pages on your website with 
an autoresponder. 

The way this works is quite simple. You create a 
directory on your website that is password protected, 
with one login and password that everybody can use. 
You then create some valuable content for that 
directory. You can call this your secret vault or your 
private stash or anything else you want to call it – as 
long as it sounds like something that your visitors 
may really want to get their hands on. For instance 
‘the secret tools that helped me earn thousands 
each month’ would probably entice many people 
who want to learn how to make money. 

Once you get the directory and the pages set up, 
put the URL of the pages and the login name and 
password in an autoresponder. Write a sales page 
and distribute it to your opt-in list, or have other list 
owners distribute it to theirs. Make sure you ‘limit’ 
the offer. Don’t let people assume that you are 
going to share this secret information with the rest 
of the world – they want to be the only ones with 
this special access! 

Keep access to the secret pages free. The goal is to 
get people to those pages, so that they can purchase 
your products or services. However, remember that 
you’ve advertised secret tools or secret information.
Therefore, when they get to those pages, there must 
be something of value there for them to collect – for 
free in most cases. Don’t make the mistake of 
thinking that you will be losing money by giving 
something away for free – you won’t. In fact, you’ve 
already gained by collecting the names and 
addresses of the people who were interested in 
your secret information!

Again, this is a marketing tactic that really works, 
and it is a great way to use an autoresponder. Once 
people have requested the information for your private 
pages, you can email them periodically, using your 
autoresponder, to let them know about updates to 
the secret site. While you are updating them, you 
can also tell them about other specials or new 
products in your line.
