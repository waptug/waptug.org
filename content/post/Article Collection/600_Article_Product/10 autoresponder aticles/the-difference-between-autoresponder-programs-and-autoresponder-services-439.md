The Difference Between Autoresponder Programs and Autoresponder Services

Many newcomers to the Internet marketing arena are not aware that there is a vast difference between an autoresponder program 
and an autoresponder service. Not knowing the difference, they often purchase the wrong type of autoresponder, and find out too 
late that they have wasted money on a program that is useless to them.

An autoresponder program is a program that is set up on your web server. This is usually a free autoresponder that comes with 
your web hosting account. Many people don’t like to use autoresponder services; so instead, they use an autoresponder program 
that they have more control over. Some of those people don’t like the autoresponder programs that come with their hosting 
accounts either and purchase autoresponder programs or scripts that must be installed on their web server.

Other people are quite happy with using an autoresponder service. This is a service that is usually paid for on a monthly or yearly 
basis. The fees are ongoing, and everything is browser based. In other words, you can set up your autoresponder messages and 
manage your opt-in list through your web browser – just as you can with an autoresponder program that is installed through your 
web hosting account. The difference is that the service runs on the autoresponder service’s web server – not yours or your web 
hosts.

Beginners are usually better off using an autoresponder service. These services are very easy to understand and to use, and no 
technical knowledge is needed to set things up. As a newcomer to the field, however, you might be concerned about the costs of 
an autoresponder service. If this is the case, you have the option of signing up with a free autoresponder service.

Free services make their money by placing advertisements in each autoresponder message that you send out. Sometimes these 
ads appear at the top of your messages, and sometimes they appear at the bottom. Some of the free services are simply an 
enticement to purchase the professional version, and have many of the more advanced features, such as tracking, disabled.

More advanced users often choose to use autoresponder programs, simply because they have more control over the autoresponder, 
and they don’t have to follow some of the stiffer rules imposed by autoresponder services, such as sending confirmation to each and 
every person who is entered into the autoresponders list. 

The autoresponder that you choose is strictly up to you, but in most cases, an autoresponder service should suit your needs. If 
you are unsure, look for a service that offers free signups, with the option of upgrading to the professional paid version at a later 
date.
