Invoicing with Autoresponders

If you have recurring invoices that you send out, you 
can easily automate this process with 
autoresponders. Many business 
owners find that they spend a good portion the day 
sending out invoices, or trying to collect on unpaid 
invoices! This can easily eat into the time that you 
could be spending generating new business.

If the amounts invoiced are the same each month, 
and due on the same day each week or month, you 
can easily automate the invoicing process with the 
use of an autoresponder. Many shopping carts that
have autoresponders built in work well for this. 
Others may take a little time to set up, but in the 
end, they will save a great deal of time overall.

Get extra usage out of the automated invoicing 
process by adding small messages to the invoices 
that alert these clients to new products or services 
that you offer. Think about your phone bill – doesn’t 
your phone company send out additional sales 
material with each bill? There is no reason you 
shouldn’t use this same marketing technique with 
your autoresponder invoices!
