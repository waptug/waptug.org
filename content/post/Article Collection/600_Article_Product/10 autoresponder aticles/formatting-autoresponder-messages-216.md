Formatting Autoresponder Messages

Have you received emails that were all broken up? 
These emails have one or two words on one line, 
then eight or ten words on the next line. In some 
cases, one word begins on one line and ends on the 
next. These emails are very hard to read, and they 
appear to be very unprofessional. Is this what you 
want your autoresponder email messages to look 
like?

If not, you need to learn how to format your 
messages. Start by reading the instructions for your 
specific autoresponder. Each one operates a bit 
differently in the way that it handles text. For 
instance, some autoresponder messages will be 
messed up if you do put a ‘hard line break’ at the 
end of each line, while others will be messed up if 
you don’t! Find out what the right option is for your 
autoresponder!

Because each email client is different, you should 
not allow any line in your message to exceed 65 
characters. This will help prevent lines from breaking 
up, and it is achieved by hitting the ‘enter’ key at 
the end of each sixty-five character line. The best 
way to be sure that your autoresponder messages 
are delivered in the correct format is to send them 
to yourself, before you send them to your list!
