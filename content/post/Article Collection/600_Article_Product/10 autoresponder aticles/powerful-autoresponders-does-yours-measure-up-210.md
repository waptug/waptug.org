Powerful Autoresponders – Does Yours Measure 
Up?

Autoresponders are very necessary when it comes
to marketing or taking care of customers. But the 
power of an autoresponder, or the lack of power, 
can mean the difference between success and 
failure.

When you use an autoresponder service, you must 
make sure that the domain that the autoresponder 
uses isn’t blacklisted by the spam watch groups. If 
it is, your messages probably won’t make it past 
the majority of spam filters, no matter how much 
you check it with spam checkers.

Also, not having the ability to track responses can 
cost you business. If you can’t track response rates, 
you won’t have any way of knowing whether your 
messages are doing you any good. A good 
autoresponder will provide the ability to track 
responses. If yours doesn’t, you might want to shop 
for a new autoresponder.

The ability to add and remove names to your 
autoresponder manually is vital. Often, people will 
contact you without going through your 
autoresponder. These people need to be put on the 
autoresponders mailing list. If you are moving your 
list from one service to another, you need the ability 
to import names and addresses to your list. Again, 
if your autoresponder service isn’t powerful enough 
to allow this, look for a different one!
