Using Your Autoresponder to Generate Leads

Autoresponders are one of the most important marketing tools that you can have if you are doing business online. In fact, the 
only thing more important that the autoresponder is your opt-in list! But all autoresponders start out without a list – the list doesn’t 
exist until your autoresponder mailing list starts filling up with names and email addresses!

The easiest and fastest way to build up an email list is to give things away for free. Some marketers will tell you that this is a 
waste of time – and if you already have a list of one hundred thousand people that you can market to, then it probably is. But for 
those who do not already have a list, this is the way that it gets built! You simply pay for advertisement to promote your freebie. 
Don’t think of this as lost money, think of it as an investment in future earnings.

Give away an ezine, free reports, free ebooks, free access to private websites, or anything else that you can think of. The object is 
to get people to sign up to receive that freebie, and to agree to receive email from you in the future! It is a win-win situation for 
everyone, but you get more than anyone else in the deal. The person gets a freebie. You get their name and email address, and 
permission to email them in the future. 

But if you do it right, you get even more than that. The freebie that you give away should also be used to promote your products or 
services. Even if it just has affiliate links for products or services that are related to the topic of the freebie, it is a way to generate 
extra revenue.  Then, when you send email in the future, you can again promote your products or services. Just be sure to include 
valuable information in the email as well, or you will have people dropping off of your autoresponder mailing list like flies!

Using every opportunity that is presented to you in the world of Internet Marketing is vital to your success. You have the opportunity 
to earn money in the freebie that you create, you have the opportunity to earn money when you send the ‘thank you’ email after a 
person has requested your freebie, and you have the opportunity to earn money every time an autoresponder message is sent out 
to that list in the future! Don’t waste those opportunities, and put it all in automatic mode with the use of an autoresponder.
