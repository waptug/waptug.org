Build Interest With Autoresponder Messages

If you are using your autoresponder to sell a product 
or service, you must be very careful as to how you 
approach your potential customer. Few people like 
a hard sale, and marketers have known for years 
that in most cases, a prospect must hear your 
message an average of seven times before they will 
make a purchase. How do you accomplish this with 
autoresponders?

It’s really quite simple, and in fact, the 
autoresponders make getting the message to your 
potential customers those seven times possible. On 
the Internet, without the use of autoresponders, you 
probably could not achieve that. Too often, marketers 
make the mistake of literally slamming the potential 
customer with a hard sales pitch with the first 
autoresponder message – this won’t work.

You build interest slowly. Start with an informative 
message – a message that educates the reader in 
some way on the topic that your product or service 
is related to. At the bottom of the message, include 
a link to the sales page for your product. Use that 
first message to focus on the problem that your 
product or service can solve, with just a hint of the 
solution. 

Build up from there, moving into how your product or 
service can solve a problem, and then with the next 
message, ease into the benefits of your product – 
giving the reader more actual information with each 
and every message. Your final message should be 
the sale pitch – not your first one! With each 
message, make sure that you are giving the 
customer information pertaining to the topic – free 
information! This is what will keep them interested 
in what you have to say.

This type of marketing is an art. It may take time to 
get it exactly right. Use the examples that other 
marketers have set for you. Pay attention to the 
messages that you receive from other marketers. 
Start a ‘swap’ file, and keep those messages. Use 
some of the better sales copy for your own 
autoresponder messages – just make sure that 
yours doesn’t turn out to be an exact copy of 
someone else’s sales message!

Remember not to start with a hard sale. Build your 
potential customers interest. Keep building on what 
the problem is, and how your product or service can 
solve that problem or fill that need. If you are doing 
this right, by the time the potential customer reads 
the last message in that series, they will be 
convinced enough to make a purchase!
