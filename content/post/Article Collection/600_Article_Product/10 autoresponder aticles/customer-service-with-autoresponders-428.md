Customer Service with Autoresponders

Ideally, when you perform customer service, it is 
done on a one-on-one basis with each of your 
customers. That works quite well in the offline world 
– but on the Internet, that simply will not do. Your 
customers are literally all over the world, and there is 
no way that you can really deal with each one of 
them personally. That is where an autoresponder 
comes in.

Customer service with autoresponders is quite 
simple. When an order is place, an autoresponder 
can send out the receipt for the sale, the information 
for accessing the product, and a ‘thank you’ email. 
This happens whether you are logged in to your 
computer or on vacation in an exotic location! But 
customer service doesn’t always end right there, and 
if you are away from your computer, you may be 
letting your customers down!

For instance, an elderly gentleman sees your 
product advertised and places an order. Everything 
goes through just fine, and he receives the receipt, 
the download information, and your ‘thank you’ email. 
Your product is an ebook, compiled into a PDF file. 
This particular gentleman doesn’t understand what 
a PDF file is, and he has no idea what you mean by 
‘right click to download.’ He needs additional 
customer service for the product that he has 
purchased, and there is nobody available to help 
him – nobody but an autoresponder.

Set up an additional autoresponder that will send out 
a list of frequently asked questions or problems that 
deal with customer service or how to access the 
product. Also set up a support autoresponder. If he 
sends a message to support, he should get an 
instant message back letting him know that his 
message has been received, and how soon it will be 
addressed. This will give him some measure of 
comfort, and in most cases, he will wait that 
specified period of time for assistance. 

However, if he doesn’t know how to download the 
product, and he sends a message to support, and 
nothing happens, he will most likely become very 
dissatisfied in a very short period of time. The 
difference between a patient customer and an irate 
customer is one simple autoresponder message 
that can and should be set up in under five minutes. 

Really think your ordering process through, and 
consider the potential problems that may occur for 
your customers. Get an autoresponder set up to 
address those problems, and you will find that your 
customers are more satisfied with your products, 
and extremely satisfied with your customer service – 
all because your autoresponders handle their 
problems right away!
