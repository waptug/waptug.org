Articles and Autoresponders

Writing articles to market a product or service is an 
excellent way to build business. The articles should
be very informative, providing the reader with 
information that is relevant to a specific topic. The 
article usually includes a link to a webpage for more 
information. The webpage, of course, is designed to 
sell a product or service that relates to the topic of 
the article. 

These articles are commonly submitted to article 
banks, websites, and ezine publishers. This is one 
of the most effective ways to market a service or 
product on the Internet, and it can become even more 
effective when it is combined with the use of an 
autoresponder.

Begin by setting each of your articles up in your 
autoresponder. It is important that each article have 
its very own autoresponder address, so you will 
need an autoresponder service that will allow you to 
do this. Next, make a master list of your articles, with 
the autoresponder address for each article listed 
beside the title. You can even add descriptions of the 
articles on your master list if you want to.

Advertising your articles one at a time can take a 
great deal of time…but advertising one autoresponder 
address – the one for the master list – won’t take 
very much time at all. Simply put it in your newsletter 
and on your website. You can even allow other 
ezine publishers to use this is a free resource for 
their subscribers!
