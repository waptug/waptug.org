Getting Your Autoresponder Messages Through The 
Spam Filters

In light of the spam problem, most email clients now
have spam filters installed. These filters catch spam
email and either move it to a ‘spam folder’ or 
automatically delete it. After spending a great deal 
of time laboring over your series of autoresponder 
messages, it would be a shame to find out that the 
majority of the messages that are sent out end up 
in the spam folder, or are automatically deleted as 
spam!

You can avoid this in two ways. First, when anyone 
signs up to receive information from your 
autoresponder, have them automatically redirected 
to a page that gives them instructions for ‘white 
listing’ you. Email clients have an actual white list 
where the owner of the email client can add specific 
addresses that should never be considered spam.

The other way to make sure that your autoresponder 
messages get through the spam filters is to check 
them using one of the various spam checkers that 
are available online. These programs are often web 
based, and free to use. They check your message 
for words or phrases that commonly trigger spam 
filters in email clients. Don’t send out any 
autoresponder messages without doing a spam 
check first!
