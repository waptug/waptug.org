Give Potential Customers A Preview With 
Autoresponders

Building customer interest and excitement is the first
step to successfully marketing many products.
Autoresponders play a vital role in building this 
interest and excitement. For instance, if you were 
developing an ebook, you may want to start telling
your website visitors and opt-in subscribers about it.
Start building interest; tell them what this product 
will do for them, and how soon it will be available.

Do more than build interest by telling them about it. 
Use an autoresponder to let them preview your
product! Even though you will be selling the product,
you can allow your potential customers to preview 
the information. Have you ever seen previews for 
movies that will be playing intheaters soon? It is the
same concept.

Load one chapter of the ebook into an autoresponder,
 and put a form on your website where your visitors 
can enter their name and email address to receive 
the preview chapter free of charge. This gets their 
name on your list of potential customer. Each 
week, send a reminder email, letting them know how
close the release date is, and what they can expect
from your product – keep building interest and
excitement.

Finally, a couple of days before you are ready to 
launch your product offer those that received the 
preview the option to buy a pre-release copy. You 
canopt to offer a discounted price, or leave the price
as it will be on launch day – the choice is yours.

Take a look at the list of people who signed up to 
receive the preview. How many of them are still ‘
subscribed’ to that list? They’ve had the option to 
stop receiving notices about your product, but they
 chose to keep receiving the information you were 
sending. These are highly targeted prospects for
 your product. They have already shown you that 
they have an interest in your product, and a large
 number of those people are simply waiting on the
 autoresponder broadcast message that will let 
them know that it is time to pick up their copy of 
your product!

Isn’t automation a wonderful thing? Using an
autoresponder, you are able to see how much of a 
market there is for your product, and build a great 
deal of interest in it before it is ever released. This 
isthe key to making sales on launch day. Use 
autoresponders to build the interest. Get your 
prospects excited about what is about to come – 
andon launch day, give them what they are waiting
for andwatch the sales pour in!
