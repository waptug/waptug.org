Tracking Autoresponder Responses

As an Internet marketer, it is vitally important to 
know how well your advertising campaigns are doing. 
Advertising campaigns cost a lot of time and money, 
and campaigns that are not doing well need to either 
be changed or scraped. When using autoresponders 
for purposes of Internet marketing, you will be able to 
tell how well your autoresponder messages are doing 
by using response tracking.

Autoresponder response tracking is usually easily 
set up with the higher quality paid autoresponder 
services. Using the tracking set up tool, you simply 
enter the web site address that you want your 
readers to visit, and the software generates a brand 
new URL. This URL is used track the number of 
clicks that you have from the autoresponder message 
to the website that you are promoting. 

When a person clicks on that special URL, the click 
is captured, and they are automatically redirected to 
the website that you intended them to arrive at. The 
visitor does not know that they have been redirected 
in most cases. You can monitor the results 
through the control panel of your autoresponder 
service account. The control panel will tell you how 
many messages were delivered, and how many 
clicks were received. Most quality autoresponders 
will even include a feature that allows you to track 
how many of the emails were opened. This is a 
great marketing research tool for mass email marketing.

Not all autoresponder services offer tracking abilities 
such as this. If tracking is important to you, you 
need to make sure that this is one of the features of 
the autoresponder service before you sign up. This 
feature gives you the ability to know whether the 
message you are sending out is effective, or if 
changes need to be made. It also allows you to 
see if the sales copy on your website is effective, in 
a ‘round-about’ way. For instance, if you are getting
thousands of clicks from the autoresponder 
message, but very few clicks from the sales page 
to the order page, you know that the 
autoresponder message is working, but the sales 
copy is failing.

If you have never tracked your autoresponder 
responses before, you should definitely consider it. 
Again, this information allows you to find out what is 
working, and what is not working. It will essentially 
make your autoresponder marketing much more 
effective and profitable. You will most likely be very 
surprised at the results of the tracking!
