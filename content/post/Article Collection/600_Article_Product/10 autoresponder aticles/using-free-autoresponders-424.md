Using Free Autoresponders

If you’ve looked at the prices of autoresponders that 
are available online, you may have decided to search 
for and use a free autoresponder for your marketing 
needs. Using free autoresponders is acceptable in 
certain situations, and in the world of Internet 
marketing, any autoresponder is better than not 
using an autoresponder at all!

Your first option for a free autoresponder should be 
the one that comes with your webhosting account – 
if you have a webhosting account. These 
autoresponders can easily be set up through the 
control panel of your website, and they do not 
contain advertisements from the autoresponder 
company or webhosting service. If you do not have 
a hosting account, or your hosting 
account does not include autoresponders, there are 
other options that you can pursue.

There are many free autoresponder services to 
choose from. These services are free, because the 
company makes their money by placing a small 
advertisement in each message that your 
autoresponder sends out. These advertisements 
may appear at the top of your auto responses, or at 
the bottom, depending on which company you use.

Many paid autoresponder services offer a free version 
as well. These free versions may or may not include 
advertisements in the outgoing messages. These 
lighter versions of the paid autoresponders typically 
do not include many of the powerful features of the 
paid versions. But if you don’t need the more 
advanced features, this is a great choice. 

Most free autoresponders have a limit on the number 
of subscribers you can have. Many people start out 
with the limited free versions, and then upgrade to 
the paid versions once their lists are large enough 
to exceed those limits. Many marketers don’t feel 
that the expense of the autoresponder is warranted 
until the list that they are building is turning a profit. 
From a business standpoint, this makes sense.

As the owner of a business, you are the only one 
who can decide whether you need a paid 
autoresponder service, or if a free one will do the job. 
If your list is small, a free autoresponder should do 
everything that you need it to do, but as your list 
grows, you should definitely consider upgrading. 
However, having the small advertisements that the 
free services place in the outgoing 
messages may present a problem if the ads 
compete with what you are trying to sell. They may 
even pose a problem if they do not directly compete 
with your product or business. Again, this depends 
on what you are trying to accomplish with your 
autoresponder.
