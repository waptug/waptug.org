How Important are Autoresponders to Internet 
Marketing?

Internet Marketing and autoresponders essentially 
go hand-in-hand. In today’s online business world, 
you simply cannot succeed at Internet marketing 
without the use of autoresponders. Autoresponders 
are used to achieve many of the marketing tasks 
that are essential to a successful online business.

Internet marketing can be very time consuming. 
Whether you do affiliate marketing or market your 
own products, an autoresponder is a big part of your 
marketing arsenal. Autoresponders are used to keep
in contact with your past customers, and to develop 
a relationship with potential customers. 

An autoresponder can be used to deliver sales 
messages to your opt-in customer list. It can be 
used to deliver email courses, to send reminders, 
and even to help you build an opt-in list if you don’t 
already have one. There are many creative ways you 
can use your autoresponder to make more sales and 
to build customer relations.

Any successful marketer will tell you that there are 
two tools that are vital to any type of online 
marketing – an opt-in list and an autoresponder. In 
fact, most marketers will agree that you could take 
away all of their other marketing tools, but they 
would fight to the death to keep the list and the 
autoresponder!
