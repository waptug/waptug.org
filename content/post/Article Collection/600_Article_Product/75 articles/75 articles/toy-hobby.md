Collect and Play:  Have Fun With a Toy Hobby

Some adults never seem to grow up.  They seem to retain their childlike wonder at the world around them.  These are the adults who have started a toy hobby. Kids like to hang around with these adults because they seem more like kids.  Sometimes having a child or a grandchild can spark an interest in toys.  Be that as it may, a toy hobby will keep a person young at heart.

Many women love dolls and never outgrow them.  Some prefer baby dolls, some fashion dolls, and still others go for antique or decorative dolls.  Often an interest in dolls will spill over into a craft interest, as the doll lover begins to craft clothing and accessories for favorite dolls.  Sometimes the hobbyist becomes skilled at crafting the dolls themselves.  Some types of dolls that are often hand-crafted are rag dolls and cloth bodied dolls with ceramic heads.  It is not uncommon to find older women who have an entire room of their homes filled with special dolls on display.

Older men, on the other hand, (and sometimes women, too) often like cars and trucks.  Antique metal cars are hot collectibles, with some older ones being quite valuable.  Matchbox cars have always been loved, but so have the large Tonka dumptruck, road grader, and bulldozer.  You can bet the grandkids will want to play with your trucks and cars.

A toy hobby that is extremely popular is collecting Beanie Babies.  These small velour animals, made by the Ty company, each have a personality all its own.  You can find Beanie Babies in every type of animal you can think of.  A similar hobby is collecting teddy bears.  There are many Beanie Baby teddy bears, but a teddy bear collector will probably want to branch out to collect other types of bears.  In fact, many bear collectors have figurines and other items collected in addition to their teddy bears.

Wooden toys are popular among adults, both to craft and to collect.  There is something quaint and pleasant about a child playing with a handcrafted wooden toy.  Wooden toys make attractive home accents wherever they get dropped, which is not something you can say about the latest plastic gizmo.  People who like country decorating often prefer wooden toys for their kids.

You don't have to outgrow toys!  A toy hobby will keep you young at heart and make you a favorite among the kids in your neighborhood.  Whether you collect toys or craft them, a toy hobby is something you can play around with!
