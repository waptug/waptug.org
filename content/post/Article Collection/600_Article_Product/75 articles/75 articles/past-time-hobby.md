A Favorite Past Time:  Hobby Ideas You Will Like

What is your favorite past time?  Hobby enthusiasts know that spare time is not to be "spent" but savored.  If you have a past time you enjoy, you will never look at your spare time in the same way again.  If you're not sure what past time hobby you would enjoy, here are some suggestions.

Many people listen to music as a favorite past time.  There is much you can learn about any style of music.  You can learn composers, famous melodies, and all about performers past and present.  You can develop sophisticated tastes in jazz or classical music or collect a large assortment of CD's.  Music makes a great past time hobby.

A lot of people love animals.  Pets of all sorts can become your hobby.  Perhaps you enjoy watching birds.  If you have trouble finding them in the trees to watch, maybe you'd like to get a pair of canaries, a budgie, or a cockatiel.  People who live in the country sometimes become interested in raising ornamental chickens, pigeons, or pheasants.  It is very interesting to watch a mother bird take care of a nest of young chicks.  Perhaps you can even raise some prize winners!

Dogs make a great hobby, too.  Walking and enjoying a pet dog is one thing, but breeding and raising show dogs is something else entirely.  Show dogs may require a bit of an investment, but many puppies are free.  There is also the aspect of training a dog in obedience.  Dogs give a lot of love back to their owners, too, so if you start a past time hobby of caring for a dog, you will never be lonely.  However, dogs require quite a bit of work and attention, especially when they are being trained, so keeping dogs is not for everyone.

Bicycles can become your favorite past time.  Hobby bicyclists are becoming more and more common to see cycling along lesser traveled highways seeing the countryside up close and personal.  Bicycling requires a helmet and suitable clothes as well as a small tool kit for roadside repairs.  Or maybe you would enjoy cycling on a smaller scale, simply taking fun rides with your family.  The choice is yours.

The world is full of interesting things to learn and do.  Don't merely sit back and watch TV.  Get interested in a past time hobby.  It's good for your mind.  In fact, it might even keep you from going senile in your old age, if you stay active in a past time hobby.  And it's a good example to our kids and grandkids if we spend our time doing something meaningful.
