Buying Inflatable Boats

As you are probably already aware of, inflatable
boats are very popular today.  Each distinct group
of inflatable boat is designed for a specific use
and therefore equipped with different components
and equipment.  

If your looking for a small boat to get you from
your ship to the shore, a typical inflatable boat
is the best answer.  If you are looking for a 
medium sized boat for diving or swimming, there 
are many choices in that area as well.  For recreation
or rescue work, there are large inflatable boats
available as well.

Dealers
The location of a reputable dealer is very important, 
as you don't want to travel too far to get an
inflatable boat.  Whether you need parts, repairs, 
or just technical support - a close dealer can also
be a close friend.  As a new boat owner, you may
also have questions, need to claim your warranty, 
or just need regular servicing.  No matter how
you look at it, a close dealer is always better
than having to travel.

Prices
Many years ago, inflatable boats were the most 
expensive types of boats and only a small amount 
of people could even afford them.  The reason for
this, was the use of exotic materials and the 
numerous hours of hand labor that went into their
construction.

Today, there are machines that do a majority of
the construction work.  Zodiac and its sister 
company Sevylor, are the leading low cost producers
today thanks to technology.  You can even finance
an inflatable boat if you need to, making them
available to almost everyone now.

Warranty
You may have heard claims from all competitors, 
with each one promising they have the best or even
the longest warranty.  A few years ago, a company
offered a lifetime warranty - although they soon
disappeared shortly thereafter.  Many manufacturers
will use an attractive warranty to substitute for
quality or even proper boat design.

In the back of your mind, you should be sure that
the company you buy from will be around long enough
to deliver on their warranty.  Zodiac has been 
building inflatable boats for over 50 years, and 
offer a limited 5 year warranty on their inflatable
boats.  Therefore, Zodiak is one of the best you
can buy today.

With all inflatable boats, you should know which
type you want before you purchase.  You can always
look around and see what each dealer offer, then
plan your purchase accordingly.  An inflatable
boat is great to have, especially for those who
own big ships and vessels.  You can't go wrong with
these boats either - as they serve many different
useful purposes.
