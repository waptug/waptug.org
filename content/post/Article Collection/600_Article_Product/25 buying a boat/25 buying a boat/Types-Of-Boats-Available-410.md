by machinery.  Fishing boats are great examples, 
as they are powered by motors or engines.

3.  Houseboat

for leisurely cruising.  Normally, a houseboat will
include living accomodations such as sleeping 
quarters, kitchen facilities, and even a full bath.
The cruising models are normally propelled by 
power.

4.  Sailboat
A sailboat is any boat that's under sail along with
no mechanical means of propulsion.  The modern 
sailboats range from one person boats to luxury
yachts that can accomodate several people.  They
are divided into three basic types:
	1.  Daysailer - This is a small boat that's
designed for comfortable sailing without sleeping
accomodations.  It offers a roomy cockpit and can
also contain an outboard auxillary engine as well.
	2.  Cruiser - Cruisers are medium sized or
large boats that contain a cabin with sleeping
quarters, toilet, food area, and usually an auxillary
engine that's built inside.

and ease of handling - normally at the expense of
comfort.  

5.  Zodiac
The Zodiac brand of high performance aluminum boats 
are some of the most popular in the entire boating
industry.  These boats are constructed with a 
conventional rigid hull with increased buoyancy and
stability.  The deep V hulls offered by these boats
are made to take any weather.  They are well known
for their prowess and are used all over the world 
for commercial search and rescue operations.

6.  Catamaran
These boats come with twin hulls.  They provide 
safety, comfort, speed, and stability that's 
unmatched by single hulled boats.  Popular with 
boating, they offer you a new twist to hitting 
the water.
