Private Label Rights E-Books


There are a lot of ways that people can profit from the Internet. E-commerce has flourished grandly and a lot of marketers found themselves earning money more than they ever dream of. One of the means that these marketers utilize for them to rake in the dollars is venturing into private label rights e-books.

First, it is necessary to know what private label rights are. 

Basically, private label rights allow persons to market somebody else's product as their own. The concept is that prospective resellers obtain the rights of a certain product from the person who created it, and then the reseller can do whatever he wants with the product, apply all the modifications that he wants, then sell it to customers, keeping the profit all to himself.

The difference of private label rights to resale rights is that with the latter, marketers can sell the product, but all of its contents should be intact. Private label rights permits the seller to modify, rearrange, alter or enhance the acquired product then sells it. 

Among private label products, one of the most profitable is the E-book. In the past, marketers purchase resale rights from an e-book author, and resell the text of the material as it is. This strategy works to the advantage of the authors, because their works can be sold with the content intact, and not being compromised. Plus, many of these e-books contain links to products that the author has interest in. The result is that the seller of the e-book will double as the author's marketing agent, because in each sale of the book, the affiliate links that it contains are exposed to each customer.

Recently, however, a new kind of resale rights became increasingly popular among marketers. They not only purchase the rights to sell the book, they also obtain the rights to do whatever they want with it, then sell it. Essentially, they edit, modify, rearrange, or change the contents of the books to suit their needs without being held liable. This allows the reseller to create new unique products from the material which is specially designed to suit the customers of the reseller.
Usually, the e-books that are being resold under private label rights are specially commissioned and have ghostwriters as authors. These works are usually basic texts that is geared to a specific market, but they are not the type that will win literary awards or climb bestseller lists. But it does not mean that these books are not worth a lot. Actually, they fill the need of niche markets because they are written specifically for them. They can gain a lot profit if the reseller manages to aim it at the correct target market.

What can a reseller do to maximize a private label e-book that he acquired?

A lot of things, actually. With a little ingenuity, a reseller could end up offering a book to customers that they will not find elsewhere. They do not have to compete with other resellers who have the same product that they are selling. The contents of the book can be changed and modified to suit the target market. Chapters can be rearranged. New sections can be added. An entirely new and eye-catching cover can be created. Titles can be revised. Pictures and illustrations can be included. Even the name of the author can be changed, and after overhauling a whole book, a reseller has already created an entirely new and unique version of the material which customers can appreciate. 

Of course, there are protests regarding the idea of allowing marketers to so whatever they want with written materials. There is the possibility that the market will be flooded with books containing different titles but have basically the same content. This can bring about the loss of consumer confidence in the e-book industry. Another disadvantage is that materials that are distributed in this manner will not be as credible as the books that have a known and respected author associated with them. These kinds of scenarios cannot be easily dismissed and requires consideration.

Marketers should see private label e-books as means to explore countless ways to create and maintain profit, and should view it as the beginning of building an Internet business empire.
