Proper Way Of Making Money With Private Label Rights

When you buy a product with rights to resale, you only will have the authority to sell such product to others. However, when you buy a certain product with private label rights, then you not only have the authority to sell such product to others but also you will have the alternative in selling the “resale right” for that same product. 

Meaning that certain individuals who bought from you the “resale rights” of that certain product in which you own the “master resale rights” will therefore get hold of the authority to sell such products to others.

Purchasing “PLR” (private label rights) packages is inexpensive when compared to employing the service of a “ghost writer” to write articles or ebooks for you. On average, PLR articles costs between 10 – 20 centavos per piece, while a ghostwriter generally charges from $10 - $30 for one good quality article.

Normally you can modify or revise the article’s content in whatever way you desire.  For instance, when you purchased a package of say 30 articles on the subject of “Landscaping”, you can construct an original ebook out of all 30 articles and call it "Lisa’s 30 Quick Tips For Landscaping” and then sell it in Clickbank. 

You can also sell your very own ebook on eBay then produce affiliate sales or even lead traffic or prospects to your website through links included your book. 

When the PLR package you purchased came in an ebook format already, you can separate the entire book into separate individual articles, where each article can be posted in your website, get spidered by search engines and bring more traffic.

Likewise, you can use each articles’ first paragraph in an autoresponder follow-up series then incorporate a link directing prospects to the full article located in your website. Or put together two articles to create a special report that you can use as motivation or incentive so prospects will enroll for a newsletter.

Here are guidelines on how to make money with private label rights:

1. Construct articles that will be displayed for your site. Affix your byline or resource box to all articles then publish them. Permit visitors to “republish” your articles in exchange for publishing also your “resource box” in their site. This will spread your advertisement over the web at the same time increase your “link popularity”.        

2. Make ezine articles.  Affix your byline or resource box to your articles then publish and distribute in your “ezine”.  Announce that your articles can be republished if your subscribers will publish your “resource box”. Aside from the fact that this will spread your advertisement as well as increase link popularity, this can also improve your “pagerank”.

3. Offer PLR articles as free bonuses.  This will increase your products’ perceived value and encourage prospects purchase your products. 

4. Offer PLR articles as bonuses for opt-in list.   It will entice visitors to sign up for your email list.   

5. Create your very own original info-products.  Modify or rewrite the articles so to create a completely different article, include yourself as the author.

6. Create completely new articles to submit to ezine “article directories”.  “free article directories”. 

7. Create and then trade your content with different websites. Affix your byline or resource box and then trade them with many high traffic sites.

8. Make articles out of your PRL articles and then promote other person’s products.  Affix your byline or resource box to promote an “affiliate program”.

9. Make promotional content for your “affiliates”. With your byline or resource box, permit your “affiliates” to incorporate their “affiliate link” to your articles. 

10. Construct whole new original info-products then sell also resale rights. 

Almost all PLR packages are controlled to only a certain quantity of buyers; so there is no worry that 'your' material will show up 3 million times over on Google. 

Having the authority to rewrite, modify or alter the PLR articles indicate that your article is entirely different from everyone else’s who purchases and repackages that same article or material. 

Before purchasing any PLR package, you must read carefully the terms and make certain that you will have authority to rewrite, alter, delete or cut the content in whatever way you want it and affix your name unto your new article.
