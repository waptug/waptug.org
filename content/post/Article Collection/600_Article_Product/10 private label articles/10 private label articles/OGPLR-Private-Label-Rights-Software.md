Private Label Rights Software


At present, there are lots of ways that marketers can gain profit from the Internet. With so many business opportunities presented online, a prospective businessman only has to choose the best venture that will suit to his taste and capabilities. 

One of the business opportunities that are fast gaining popularity from Internet marketers are private label rights products. Among the numerous products being offered up under private labels, software products are one of those that proliferated. 

But first, one should understand the concept of private label rights. 

Private label rights enable a reseller to purchase a product not only for selling purposes, but also to do whatever that he wants with it. That is the main distinction of private label rights with resale rights. The latter gives resellers license to sell the product, provided that its contents stay intact. Private label rights give permission to the reseller to apply modifications and changes the product as he sees it fit to make it saleable to a specific market, without being held liable for it.

Under these rights, resellers are specifically allowed to:

-dispense the product to others
-provide a version that is branded, attached with affiliate links
-include the product with other merchandise when packaged
-use it as a bonus giveaway
-utilize product as web site content 
-divide it into separate articles (applicable to e-books)
-Sell it through auctions
-modify or change the product

These items can actually serve as a checklist for resellers when it comes to negotiating with product owner when acquiring a material for private label rights.

Materials that are usually offered under private labels are software source codes, e-books, and graphic files. 

Each of the products has its advantages and disadvantages when being resold. For source codes, a reseller will have to gain some knowledge so he can compile the source codes into the finished software, especially if it has to be modified according to his specifications. An average reseller will have to employ the services of an expert to do this task, and this will add substantial cost and time. The advantage is, software has a much higher value when it comes to reselling compared to reports and e-books.

In the case of private label software products, the core technology of the product can be created and owned by another person or company, but resellers can place his brand and have the software tailor-made by utilizing layout and color schemes, logos, languages and other options that can be configurated to make the software look like it was created by the reseller. IN addition, the reseller can choose the name of the program and company, and the website to be associated with the software. 

The makers of the software will offer the reseller full resell rights to the branded version of the product, with the understanding that sales choices will not be interfered upon, and royalties will not be collected, which will enable the reseller to establish his own price for the software and pocket all the profits.

Also, in the deal between the creator of the software and the reseller, a demo version of the product, along with the full version, can be provided. This demo version can be distributed by the reseller without any hindrance. The benefits of having a demo version is that the traffic to the web site of the reseller will increase each time the demo is downloaded.  

Usually, there are two levels of private labeling or branding offered for resellers: first is the tests and surveys that the reseller will manage and implement, and second, the technology and application that permits the reseller to author and host the tests and surveys. 

When it comes to transferring the ownership of the software, the following may be provided by the software's creator: documentation of the transaction and a special URL for each software title purchased by the reseller. This URL is provided so that resellers can dispense it to others top verify the ownership of the software.   

Software is only one among the many products that can be offered under private labels. A reseller with great marketing savvy can profit greatly from venturing into private label rights product. What they have to do is to choose the right product that they can improve on and market in order for them to rake in the profits.
