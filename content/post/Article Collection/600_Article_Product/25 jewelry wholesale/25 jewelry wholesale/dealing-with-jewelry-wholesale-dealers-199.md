Dealing with Jewelry Wholesale Dealers

Many people think that if they try to talk to a 
jewelry wholesale dealer that they will get better 
bargains. In the case of buying in bulk, they are 
absolutely right! Most jewelry wholesale dealers 
will offer you a lower price if you are buying in 
bulk – but if you are just buying one or two pieces, 
it really doesn’t pay for them to offer you prices 
below the wholesale price.

Other than getting a good price, you want to make 
sure that you are getting quality jewelry. If you can 
deal with the jewelry wholesale dealer in person, 
you should. But in most situations, this will not be 
the case. Instead, contact the dealer by phone 
and talk to them. Establish a relationship, and 
keep that relationship on good terms at all times. 
As time goes by, you may be able to get even 
better deals from the wholesaler, and you can 
probably work out credit terms as well.

Just remember that your jewelry wholesale dealer 
is a human being, and treat them as such. If you 
ever find that your dealer isn’t being honest with you, 
or is selling low quality jewelry, look for a new 
wholesaler.
