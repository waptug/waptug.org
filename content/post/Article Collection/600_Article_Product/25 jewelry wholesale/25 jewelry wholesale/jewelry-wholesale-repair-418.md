Jewelry Wholesale Repair

If you make jewelry wholesale, then you definitely 
need to know how to make repairs to the jewelry 
that you sale. If you can offer your clients free or 
discounted repairs, you will find that you have 
better customer relations. Also, you need to have 
the ability to guarantee your pieces and offer free 
repairs for a specified period of time after the sale. 
This is just good business – and it will set you 
apart from many of your competitors.

If you’ve made the jewelry, you probably already 
know how to repair it. The repair that is needed is 
probably the simple replacement of a piece on the 
jewelry, such as a clasp or replacing a stone that 
has come lose. This type of work can usually be 
done quickly, and at very little expense.

If you don’t make the jewelry yourself, you still need 
to offer free repairs for a specified period of time. 
Again, this is just good business. In this case, you 
need to learn some jewelry repair, and you need to 
purchase some jewelry making or jewelry repair 
tools. These tools are very small, and they were 
specifically designed to make or repair jewelry. For 
the most part, these tools are very inexpensive.

One piece of equipment that you will need is a 
magnifying glass that stands on its own, allowing 
you to use both of your hands. You also need very 
good lighting that can be pointed directly onto the 
jewelry that you are repairing. Both of these are 
essential if you want to do a good job, and avoid 
eye strain at the same time.

You will need some jewelry making supplies as 
well, such as extra clasps, chains, and possibly 
even gemstones. Of course, you don’t want to 
keep too much of this on hand, as you may never 
use any of it…so use your best judgment here. 

Before you rush out and purchase a book or course 
on jewelry making and repair, find out if the 
company that you order the jewelry wholesale from 
in the first place has any guarantees. If so, you 
don’t need to learn anything. Simply have your 
customer ship the jewelry back to you, or directly 
to the company, and they should take care of the 
repairs. However, follow up for your customer – 
don’t leave the customer to deal with the wholesale 
company on their own – that is bad business! If the 
jewelry wholesale company doesn’t treat your 
customer right, it will reflect on you!
