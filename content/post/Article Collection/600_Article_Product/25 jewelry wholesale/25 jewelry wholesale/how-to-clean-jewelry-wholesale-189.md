How to Clean Jewelry Wholesale

There are many different brands of jewelry cleaners 
on the market today. Depending on how your 
jewelry is made, these products may or may not be 
safe for your jewelry wholesale! Before using 
jewelry cleaner, take a good long look at the jewelry 
and try to determine what it is made of.

First, any jewelry that has pieces glued on should 
not be soaked in jewelry cleaner. Instead, use a 
little Woolite mixed with water, and soak the piece 
for just a couple of minutes. Remove the piece from 
the mixture and dry it immediately – but gently – 
with a soft cloth. Use a soft toothbrush to gently 
scrub small crevices. 

Avoid soaking pearls! They may come from the 
ocean – but water from your tap may damage them. 
Simply wipe the pearl with a damp cloth, then use 
a polishing cloth to give it back its shine. Never 
soak any of your jewelry overnight. It isn’t 
necessary, and it may harm the jewelry wholesale. 
Again, it is important to know what gems are used 
in your jewelry, and how the piece was constructed 
before determining how you will clean it.
