Jewelry Wholesale Supplies

No matter what you may need jewelry wholesale 
supplies for, there are a variety of sources for 
obtaining them. However, in most cases, you will 
find the least expensive supplies through online 
sources. This is due to the fact that you literally 
have the whole world of jewelry wholesale supply 
sources at the touch of a button – and those 
companies are all in competition with each other.

Whether you are looking for stones, crystals, 
beads, catches, or other supplies and tools, you 
can find everything you are looking for online – at 
really great prices. You can order the supplies 
directly, or request a catalog from hundreds of 
different suppliers. In many cases, when you place 
an order, you will be put on the mailing list, and 
you will automatically receive the catalog 
periodically without having to ask for it.

You should never pay for the catalog. Avoid sites 
that ask for payment to receive the catalog, or sites 
that require you to pay for membership. You can 
expect, however, to be required to register at the 
sites that you do business with – at no charge. It 
is also important to check the refund and exchange 
policies for each site that you do business with. 

If you have any doubts as to the legitimacy of an 
online business, check them out with the BBB 
online. If there have been any complaints, the BBB 
will have a record of it, and that information is 
available to the public at no charge. 

eBay is another option. You can find a wide variety 
of jewelry wholesale supplies through these 
auctions, but eBay cannot be depended on as a 
steady supplier. When you do find supplies that 
you wish to bid on or purchase through eBay, 
make sure that you check the seller’s rating and 
feedback before making the bid or purchase!

If shopping online makes you really uncomfortable, 
there are other ways to find jewelry wholesale 
supplies. Locate the various companies online, and 
then call them directly to place your order over the 
phone, or for instructions for mail orders. You can 
find the contact information for most companies on 
the website where it says ‘contact us’ or ‘about us.’

You can also purchase your supplies through 
discount stores in your area. However, you should 
be aware that you will not be paying wholesale 
prices. You will be paying discounted retail prices. 
Wholesale prices are much cheaper – especially 
when you make purchases in bulk quantities.
