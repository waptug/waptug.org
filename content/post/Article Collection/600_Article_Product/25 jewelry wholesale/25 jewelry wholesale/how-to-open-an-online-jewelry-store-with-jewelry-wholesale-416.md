How to Open An Online 
Jewelry Store With Jewelry Wholesale

Opening your own jewelry store has never been 
easier than it is now. In fact, you can use the 
Internet to open your own online jewelry store and 
never stock a single piece of jewelry! In fact, your 
jewelry store could be open for business in less 
than a day – and the only thing you would need to 
do is market it! This is pretty much an instant 
business.

First, find jewelry wholesale suppliers. If you want a 
truly ‘hands-off’ business, find a wholesaler who will 
drop ship to your customers. This way, you never 
have to handle any of the stock. Here is how it 
works. You get your website set up, with an online 
catalog of all of the jewelry that you offer. You 
market that site to the public. Customers start 
visiting your site, and they place orders. You 
forward those orders to the drop shipper, and the 
drop shipper handles the rest! 

Most wholesalers will require you to pay for the 
merchandise before it is shipped. This shouldn’t be 
a problem because you will require your customers 
to pay for their orders at the time the order is 
placed. Of course, you charge more for the jewelry 
than the wholesaler charges you.

In most cases, you will be allowed to set your own 
prices. Look to see what the wholesaler charges 
you, including shipping, then add 15% to 30% to 
that price. This is what you should charge your 
customers. 

If you aren’t sure how to go about setting up a 
website, you can probably find a wholesaler who 
will provide you with a website. Most of these 
wholesalers charge a fee for the site, and your site 
will usually look like all of their other distributors. 
This should be your last option.

You may consider opening an eBay store. There is 
a fee for this as well, but at least your store will be 
unique. You can also bypass the eBay store and 
simply set up eBay auctions, which are very 
affordable for everyone. Make sure that you set a 
minimum reserve price for the jewelry that you are 
selling so that you don’t lose money, and make 
sure that the buyer pays all shipping costs and 
insurance.

Again, setting up an online jewelry store with 
jewelry wholesale is one of the easiest ways to start 
a business today. You can literally be up and 
running in a few short hours, and making money 
within twenty-four hours of ‘opening your doors!’
