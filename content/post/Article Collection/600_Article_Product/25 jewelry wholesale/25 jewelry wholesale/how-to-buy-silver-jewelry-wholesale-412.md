How to Buy Silver Jewelry Wholesale

Silver jewelry is not only beautiful, it is very much in 
style these days. Silver jewelry compliments 
anything you wear, and it is usually less expensive 
than gold jewelry. There are many sources from 
which you can buy silver jewelry wholesale, but the 
Internet will offer you the biggest selection possible. 
After all – you will have the whole world at your feet 
– or fingertips.

As with any other jewelry, begin your search online. 
There are countless jewelry wholesalers online, and 
many of them specialize in silver jewelry. When you 
buy your jewelry from jewelry wholesale sources, 
you will pay a fraction of the cost that you would 
pay at a retailer’s place of business, such as a 
jewelry store.

When you purchase silver jewelry wholesale, make 
sure that you are purchasing sterling silver jewelry. 
Sterling silver is almost always marked with the 
numbers ‘925.’ This is the highest quality of silver 
that you can buy – wholesale or retail. Note that 
there is no such thing as ‘high quality sterling 
silver’ and ‘lower quality sterling silver.’ Sterling 
silver comes in one quality – sterling silver. The 
weight of the sterling silver used in the piece should 
be the determining factor in the cost, unless the 
item was hand-made, in which case it will cost 
considerably more than similar pieces that were 
not hand made.

Silver jewelry tarnishes – whether it is sterling silver 
or not. You must clean and polish your silver 
jewelry on a regular basis to help it keep its shine. 
There are many different brands of silver polish on 
the market that can be used to accomplish this. 
You should plan to clean your silver jewelry on a 
weekly basis.

Buying silver jewelry wholesale is the best way to 
go. Silver is already relatively inexpensive – even at 
wholesale prices. When purchasing such jewelry, 
the silver or quality of the silver is not what you 
need to concern yourself with – again, silver is 
silver, just make sure it is sterling silver. The 
settings and stones that are used in the piece 
should be your concern. 

You need to insure that the piece is solidly 
constructed, and you need to make sure that the 
gems used are not simulated gems – unless that is 
what you want. Of course, when real gems are used, 
such as diamonds, the cost of the jewelry will rise 
considerably. But as long as you are buying jewelry 
wholesale, the price will still be the lowest price you 
will find.
