Jewelry Wholesale and eBay Auctions

eBay is a great place to find almost any item that 
you can imagine. Jewelry wholesale auctions are 
quite common on eBay, and in many cases, you 
cannot beat the deals that are offered here. 
However, there are also many con artists that 
operate through eBay, and you have to use caution.

Start by reading all of the fine details about the 
jewelry wholesale lots that you are purchasing. If 
you still have questions, send those questions to 
the seller through eBay’s website. Make sure that 
you keep all of your contact with the seller through 
the website so that there is documentation.

Check out the person or company that is offering 
the jewelry wholesale. Look at their ratings and their 
feedback. Has there been any negative feedback? 
If so, you may want to reconsider your options and 
look into other auctions. If the feedback is all 
positive, and the seller’s rating is high, doing 
business with them should not be a problem.

Make sure that you are clear about shipment costs 
and the shipment time frame, as well as the 
payment options offered. Usually, the buyer is 
responsible for the shipment costs, and this is 
added to the total and paid before the item ships. 
In the case of high ticket items, insurance may 
be required on the item as well. The seller seldom 
pays the shipping costs. 

If the jewelry wholesale is a high ticket item, such 
as jewelry that is bought in bulk or rare pieces of 
expensive jewelry, you should strongly consider 
using the escrow service that is recommended by 
eBay. If the seller recommends any escrow service 
other than the one that eBay recommends, you 
might not want to do business with this seller – it 
could be a scam. 

Beware of sniper’s on eBay! Sniping is against the 
rules at eBay, but a large group of people do it 
anyway. Sniping is automatic bidding, which is not 
against the rules, but the software or service is 
instructed to place the highest bid in the last 
possible minute of the auction – leaving no time for 
anyone else to place a higher bid. Again, this is 
against eBay’s rules.

Instead of sniping, place your first bid at the 
maximum amount that you are willing to pay for 
the jewelry wholesale lot. Each time the bid is 
raised, your bid will automatically be raised – until 
your limit is reached. This is not sniping, and it is 
a perfectly legal way to bid on auctions at eBay.
