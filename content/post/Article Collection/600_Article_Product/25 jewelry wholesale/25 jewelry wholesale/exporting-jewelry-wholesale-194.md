Exporting Jewelry Wholesale

If you plan to export jewelry wholesale, you may 
need to find out if it is legal. First you must 
understand that sending just one piece of jewelry to 
another country is in fact ‘exporting goods.’ This is 
true even if the country is Mexico or Canada! No 
matter where it is going, if it is outside of the United 
States, or the country that you live in, it is 
exporting. 

You can find out if exporting certain pieces of 
jewelry is legal by calling the customs agency in 
your state, or by calling the United States Customs 
Office. Describe the jewelry and as well as the 
precious stones it contains, and tell them where it 
is being sent. They will be able to tell you if shipping 
it is legal, and what problems may be encountered 
at customs in the country it is being shipped to.

Take shipping costs into consideration, and make 
sure that your customer pays for that! Shipping to 
other countries can be quite costly, and if you pay 
for that shipping, you probably won’t realize any 
profits on the jewelry wholesale that you are 
shipping out of the country!
