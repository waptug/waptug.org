How to Select Jewelry Wholesale

Selecting jewelry isn’t hard, when you can see it 
and touch it. However when you purchase jewelry 
wholesale, you often won’t have this opportunity 
before making a purchase, since most of these 
purchases are made online or through mail order. 
This makes the selection process a bit harder. 

Start by reading all of the information that is 
supplied. Make sure that words like ‘gold plated’ or 
‘faux’ are not used if you are looking for genuine 
pieces. Contact the company and ask for more 
information if you are unsure about anything that 
you are reading as well. Make sure you are getting 
wholesale prices. Look for similar pieces at the 
online jewelry stores, or even at your local jewelry 
stores, and compare the prices. The wholesale 
price should be much lower.

Also check the refund and exchange policy of the 
business you are planning to purchase from. Make 
sure that there is a ‘no questions asked’ money 
back guarantee, or the offer of a 100% refund if you 
are not satisfied. If there is no refund policy, there 
should be no deal! You can find other jewelry 
wholesale from companies that do offer refunds 
and exchanges.
