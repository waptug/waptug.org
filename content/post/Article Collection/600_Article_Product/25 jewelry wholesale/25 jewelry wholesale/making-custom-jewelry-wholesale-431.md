Making Custom Jewelry Wholesale

If you have a great sense of style and creativity, 
you should consider constructing quality custom 
jewelry wholesale for individual clients. If you are 
good at it, you will find that you have customers 
calling you over and over again to construct special 
pieces for them, or as gifts for others.

Making custom jewelry wholesale isn’t hard. Again, 
you need a sense of style and creativity – but the 
skills needed to make jewelry are very easy to 
learn. The object is to make your pieces unique – 
exclusive. When a client wears custom jewelry 
that you designed and constructed, they should 
wear it knowing that there is none other like it in 
the whole world!

Working with clients is actually the hardest part. 
You need to get a picture in your mind that 
matches the picture that is in their minds. Never 
construct the piece while they are watching – this 
is in effect teaching them how to do it themselves, 
and you will probably lose a customer. Never let 
them know just how easy it is! 

Talk at length with the client. This is the only way 
that you can design custom jewelry that matches 
their likes, dislikes, and personality. If the piece is 
to be a gift for someone else, ask lots of questions 
about that person, and if possible, meet them in 
person yourself. Remember that uniqueness and 
exclusivity are the key to making this type of 
business successful – but great communication 
with the clients is vitally important as well.

Many clients will want you to make custom jewelry 
wholesale using stones or gems that they already 
have. They may even want you to just enhance a 
piece that they already have. Before you start doing 
this, make sure that you have the skill and 
qualifications necessary to do this work. You do 
not want to destroy a client’s beloved jewelry! Make 
sure that you ask about the history of the piece, 
and find out what special meaning that piece holds 
for your client as well.

Of course, you will purchase the pieces that you 
need to make the custom jewelry from wholesale 
resources. Just make sure that you are buying 
quality parts – and look for sources for unique 
jewelry making supplies as well – imported pieces 
are great sources for uniqueness. You will have to 
quote your client a price before you start, so be 
careful here. You don’t want to lose money. Once 
you’ve quoted a price, deduct 15% to 30% from it. 
Think of the remainder as your ‘budget’ when 
buying supplies to make the custom jewelry 
wholesale.
