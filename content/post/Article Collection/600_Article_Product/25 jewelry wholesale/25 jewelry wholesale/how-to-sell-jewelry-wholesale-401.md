How to Sell Jewelry Wholesale

If you are a creative person, with a great sense of 
style and flair, you may be able to start your own 
business – making and selling jewelry wholesale. 
Because people are so very unique, they want 
jewelry pieces that are unique – one-of-a-kind 
pieces that nobody else in the world owns! This 
desire can make you quite a bit of money – 
simply start your very own jewelry wholesale 
company.

You can easily order wholesale supplies from 
hundreds of companies around the globe online – 
at really low prices. It is important to keep up with 
how much each part of each piece of jewelry costs 
you, and to get a total cost of each piece, including 
any expenses that you had for having supplies 
shipped to you. With the total cost figured, you can 
easily set your prices by adding 15% to the cost. 

You can sell your pieces in a variety of ways. You 
can open your own online wholesale jewelry store, 
sell to local jewelry stores, rent booths at local flea 
markets and fairs, or advertise your jewelry making 
skills and take orders for unique pieces. You can 
also sell your pieces on consignment at boutiques.

You want to be known for your quality. Always 
select the highest quality gems and stones for your 
pieces, and make sure that the craftsmanship is 
outstanding. Become exclusive, and more people 
will want to purchase your pieces – and never make 
any two pieces alike. 

However, you can also go the other route and make 
hundreds of identical pieces, as they are ordered.  
You do this by making one very unique, high quality 
piece, and showing it to your local jewelry stores. 
Ask them if they would like to order in bulk, then fill 
the order. 

Another option is to do catalog sales. Make enough 
pieces to fill a small catalog, and take pictures of 
each piece. Write a description for each piece and 
then put together your own catalog using software 
and a good printer – or send the work to a print 
shop. You can send these catalogs out to a list 
that you obtain from a direct mailing list company.

This type of business does require creativity and 
skill, but it also requires the ability to market 
yourself and your jewelry. You need to have 
business cards printed, and also have catalogs and 
brochures printed as well to market your jewelry 
wholesale business.
