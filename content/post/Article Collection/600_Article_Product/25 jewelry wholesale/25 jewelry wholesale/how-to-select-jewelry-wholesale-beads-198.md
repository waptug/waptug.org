How to Select Jewelry Wholesale Beads

When purchasing wholesale jewelry beads, you 
must use care. You don’t want to end up with beads 
that aren’t worth anything to you! Selecting beads 
takes a lot of thought – we aren’t talking about 
plastic beads that children use to make jewelry. We 
are talking about quality beads used to make grown 
up jewelry!

Avoid cheap plastic beads. This may be suitable for 
some pieces, but it isn’t very durable – or very 
pretty. Instead, buy glass beads or Lucite beads. 
These are not only durable, they are very shiny and 
pretty. They do not have the ‘cloudy’ look of plastic 
beads. 

Inspect the beads for imperfections if possible. 
Beads that are ‘lopsided’ won’t do. Beads that are 
chipped, broken, or scratched are useless. Don’t 
purchase these beads no matter how cheap they 
are!

Most jewelry wholesale beads are sold in bulk. In 
this case, you probably won’t have the opportunity 
to inspect the beads, so ask about the exchange 
policy. Will you be able to exchange the beads that 
are less than perfect? Depending on how the beads 
are packaged and sold, and the policy of the 
business selling the jewelry wholesale beads, this 
may not be possible.
