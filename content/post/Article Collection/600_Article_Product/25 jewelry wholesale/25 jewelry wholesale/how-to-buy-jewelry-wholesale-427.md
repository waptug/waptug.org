How to Buy Jewelry Wholesale

Buying jewelry wholesale is really quite easy. The 
Internet gives you access to all of the wholesale 
jewelry companies you could ever need to make 
your selections, so you can buy exactly what you 
want or need – at very competitive prices. 

There is a difference between online jewelry stores 
and online wholesale companies. Online jewelry 
stores sell jewelry at retail prices, even though the 
price may be slightly discounted. Wholesale 
companies sell jewelry at wholesale prices – which 
of course are cheaper than retail prices. 

There are many sites where you can purchase 
directories of wholesale companies, but this really 
isn’t necessary. Just use a search engine like 
Google to find what you are looking for. If you are 
looking for an engagement ring at a wholesale 
price, for example, simply type ‘engagement ring 
wholesale’ into the search box – a whole slew of 
wholesalers who carry engagement rings will pop 
up in the search results.

Be aware that some wholesaler’s will only sell in 
bulk. Of course, if you just want to buy one 
engagement ring, you do not want to buy in bulk. 
But there are many companies that will sell just 
one item – you just have to look for them.

If buying online isn’t what you are interested in, 
consider joining a discount club, such as Sam’s. 
Here you will find jewelry at deeply discounted 
retail prices, which is the next best thing to jewelry 
wholesale prices – but again, the wholesale prices 
will be lower.

When dealing with an online wholesale company, 
you need to do several things. First, you want to be 
sure that you are buying the real thing. There are 
many companies out there that will advertise that 
their jewelry is ‘authentic.’ Read the sales copy 
very carefully, and educate yourself quickly. For 
instance, beware of words like ‘gold plated’ or 
‘realistic.’ This is an indication that the jewelry isn’t 
gold, or that stones are fake. 

Also find out if the company has a refund or 
exchange policy, as well as a 100% money back 
guarantee. This is important, and it will protect you 
if you find that you are not happy with the pieces 
you have purchased, or if they are of lesser quality 
than you expected. 

Also consider using eBay to find jewelry wholesale 
prices. Again, use caution. Check the seller’s 
feedback and ratings, and make sure that you are 
dealing with a reputable person or company. If the 
jewelry is an important piece, use the escrow 
service that eBay recommends – even if you have to 
pay the escrow fees yourself!
