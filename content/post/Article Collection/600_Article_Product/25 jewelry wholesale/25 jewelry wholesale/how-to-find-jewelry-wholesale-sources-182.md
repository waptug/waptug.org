How to Find Jewelry Wholesale Sources

If you are in the jewelry business or thinking about 
getting into the jewelry business, you need to find 
jewelry wholesale sources. Finding these sources 
isn’t as difficult as you might think – they are 
everywhere, and if you have access to the Internet, 
you literally have the world of jewelry wholesale at 
your fingertips.

There are many wholesale company directories 
available online, but you really don’t have to 
purchase these to find the jewelry wholesale 
companies. Instead, use the search engine and 
type ‘jewelry wholesale companies’ or ‘jewelry 
wholesale suppliers’ into the search box. This is 
the easiest, and cheapest way to find jewelry 
wholesale sources. 

Start making a list of sources. You can do this on 
notepad or in a spreadsheet. Keep up with which 
company has the best prices on certain items, 
shipping costs, contact information, and any other 
information you may need in the course of doing 
business.

Don’t forget the online auctions, and remember that 
eBay isn’t the only online auction either! Keep your 
eyes open for great deals on jewelry, and make 
bulk purchases when you can.
