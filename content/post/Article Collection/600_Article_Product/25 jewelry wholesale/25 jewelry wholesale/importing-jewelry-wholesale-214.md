Importing Jewelry Wholesale

If you are considering importing jewelry wholesale, 
you might want to see what your other options are. 
When jewelry is imported, there are additional 
costs, such as high shipping costs, that you may 
not be prepared to pay. There are also other issues 
to consider as well.

Customs is a major issue, because some materials 
that come from endangered animals are outlawed in 
the United States – ivory for example. When 
importing jewelry, you need to be sure that all of 
the materials that make up the jewelry can be 
legally imported. 

The possibility of not getting what you paid for is 
another consideration that you must think about. If 
you order from someone outside of the United 
States – where the United States has no legal 
jurisdiction – there won’t be anything you can do if 
you are ripped off. If you are importing jewelry 
wholesale, make sure that you are dealing with a 
reputable company.

Usually, if you can find the same pieces of jewelry 
for sale in the United States, at a slightly higher 
cost, you will be better off making your purchase in 
the US. By the time you add shipping to the 
imported jewelry, it will probably cost more. 
However, there are many pieces that can only be 
found in other countries.
