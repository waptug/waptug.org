How to Find Boxes for Your Jewelry Wholesale

If you make your own jewelry or buy wholesale 
jewelry that is not in a box, you will need a source 
for jewelry boxes! Your customers will want their 
jewelry to arrive in nice display boxes that can be 
wrapped or presented to the person they bought 
the jewelry for. 

Boxes for jewelry can be found at wholesale prices 
all over the internet. Simply do a search in any 
search engine for ‘boxes for jewelry’ and you will be 
surprised at the results. You can even have your 
business name or logo printed on the boxes as 
well, for an additional cost.

When you shop for boxes to package your jewelry 
wholesale in, make sure that you buy in bulk for the 
best prices. Also make sure that you can return the 
boxes for an exchange in the event that the boxes 
are the wrong size, or for a refund if the boxes arrive 
damaged.

Don’t make the mistake of not shipping your jewelry
 wholesale to your customers in jewel boxes. This 
will make you appear to be unprofessional, or like a 
small time operation.
