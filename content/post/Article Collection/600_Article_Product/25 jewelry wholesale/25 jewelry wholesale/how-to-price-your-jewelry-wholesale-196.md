How to Price Your Jewelry Wholesale

Pricing is an issue that many people in the jewelry 
business often worry about. However, there is a 
method that you can easily use, whether you 
purchase jewelry wholesale or make your own
jewelry. Pricing is very important. You don’t want 
to charge too much, because you won’t sell 
anything. On the other hand, you want to make 
sure that you charge enough to make a profit.

If you purchase your jewelry at wholesale prices, a 
markup of 15% to 30% is usual, and people will pay 
these prices. In the grand scheme of things, apply 
the 30% markup, and make that the ‘regular’ price. 
When you need to move merchandise hold a sale, 
and use the 15% markup price as the sale price. 

If you make your own jewelry, determine the total 
cost of the piece, including the cost of supplies, 
shipping, warehousing and packaging, then apply a 
15% markup. With the 15% markup, your jewelry 
will be priced at the wholesale price. If you sell the 
jewelry to the general public yourself, as opposed 
to selling it to retailers, apply the retail price, which 
in this case would be about 45% above your costs.
