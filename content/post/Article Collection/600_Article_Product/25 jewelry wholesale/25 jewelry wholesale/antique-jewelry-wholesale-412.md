Antique Jewelry Wholesale

Antique jewelry is typically very valuable, and 
purchasing such jewelry costs quite a bit of money. 
But then again, it is possible to buy antique jewelry 
wholesale as well – if you know where to look. 

Most people think that online auctions, such as 
eBay is the way to go. While this is true 
occasionally, you will usually find that the seller 
knows the value of what they are selling, and the 
price is quite high. There are other ways to find 
antique jewelry at wholesale prices – or below.

Keep an eye on your newspaper for advertised 
estate sales and garage sales. Typically, at these 
sales, the people holding the sale really don’t know 
the value of what they have. You can literally 
purchase hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of 
antique jewelry for just a few dollars on a typical 
Saturday morning.

It is important that you not look too closely at the 
jewelry when you are buying it. If the piece is 
valuable, you don’t want the seller to know how 
valuable it is! It isn’t your fault that they didn’t get it 
appraised – as you will as soon as you leave! Keep 
a straight face, keep your happiness and joy to 
yourself, and pay the fifty cents or two bucks that 
they want for the piece, get in your car and head to 
a trusted jeweler for an appraisal!

It is possible that the piece isn’t worth anything – 
but occasionally, you will stumble across some real 
finds! Even if the piece isn’t worth anything, if you 
make jewelry, you may be able to disassemble it 
for the parts. 

Finding antique jewelry wholesale is very exciting. 
In fact, spending those Saturday mornings at the 
yard sales and estate sales may even become 
addicting! Yard sales and estate sales – especially 
estate sales where grandchildren are not interested 
in their grandma’s old ugly jewelry are the best 
sources for antique jewelry at wholesale prices – or 
below wholesale prices.

This doesn’t mean that there aren’t some real find 
on eBay as well, so don’t discount it. Keep an eye 
on the jewelry categories, as well as the antique or 
vintage categories. When you do find something 
you want to bid on, make sure that the seller has a 
good reputation. If the piece is very expensive, use 
the escrow service that is recommended by eBay. 
Also talk to the seller quite a bit to be sure that you 
understand exactly what is being advertised!
