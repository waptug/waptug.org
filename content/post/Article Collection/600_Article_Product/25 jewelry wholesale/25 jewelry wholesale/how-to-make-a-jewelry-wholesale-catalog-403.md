How to Make A Jewelry Wholesale Catalog

So you want to sell your jewelry? Well, selling 
jewelry wholesale is a big business, and you 
definitely need a catalog of your offerings! Making 
a catalog isn’t as difficult as you might think. First, 
you have two options: an online catalog or a print 
catalog. The choice is yours.

Overall, an online catalog is the least expensive 
way to advertise your jewelry wholesale company – 
but with all of the online jewelry stores and online 
wholesalers, it may not be the most effective way 
to make sales. A print catalog should strongly be 
considered for a direct mailing. 

If you make your own jewelry, you will need to get 
good pictures of the jewelry – preferably laid on a 
velvet setting. Black or blue velvet will bring out the 
jewelry the most. You can take these pictures 
yourself with a digital camera, or have a 
professional take the photographs. It is cheaper to 
do it yourself, of course.

Load the pictures up onto your computer, and use 
publishing software, such as Microsoft Publisher to 
design and layout your catalog. This may take a 
little time and patience, but it is much cheaper than 
having someone else do it.

Since you will need hundreds, if not thousands of 
copies of your catalog, your best bet will be to save
the catalog on a CD and take it to a print shop that 
can handle the job. This will cost money – 
especially since the pages need to be glossy and 
in color, and the catalog will need to be bound – 
but this expense will be well worth it if you will be 
doing a mass direct mailing.

In order to do a mass direct mailing, you simply 
find a reputable company who either sells mailing 
lists or does the mailing for you. You can actually 
request lists of mailing addresses where the person 
has expressed an interest in purchasing wholesale 
jewelry – or any other criteria that you set. In most 
cases, it is best to have the company handle the 
mailing for you. They will get the best rates on the 
mailing because they can use the bulk mail rate.

Make sure that you use a reputable printer, and a 
reputable direct mail company! This is an investment 
in the future of your business, and your jewelry 
wholesale catalog needs to be perfect in every way – 
and the mailing needs to go off without a hitch!
