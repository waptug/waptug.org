Jewelry Wholesale – Diamonds

There may come a time in your jewelry making 
career when you need to select diamonds for a 
special piece you are working on. Buying diamonds 
is much like buying any other gem – you find one 
that is the right size or shape for the piece you are 
making and you purchase it. WRONG. Much more 
thought and consideration must go into purchasing 
a diamond. After all – Diamonds are forever, and 
you want your jewelry wholesale to last forever too.

There are four C’s when it comes to buying a 
diamond: cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. All of 
these must be considered because you want the 
diamond used in your jewelry wholesale to be as 
beautiful as possible. Remember that the diamond 
should not overpower the entire piece, but it should 
be the main attraction and compliment the rest of 
the piece as well.

The cut of the diamond does not refer to the shape 
of it. It refers to the way that it was cut – the quality 
of the cut. The shine and fluorescence of the 
diamond is determined by how it was cut. The 
shape of the diamond is only a second factor – or 
an after thought – in terms of the quality of the cut.

The clarity of a diamond does not refer to how clear 
it is. Instead, it refers to how perfect or flawless – 
or imperfect – a diamond is. There are internal 
imperfections and external imperfections. A 
diamond that has no imperfections is flawless – 
and expensive.

Diamonds come in many colors. The most common 
are white and yellow. Other colors are available, but 
they are rare and expensive. The only color you 
should never consider is a ‘blue white’ diamond. A 
jeweler may try to tell you that this is a rare quality 
diamond, but it is in fact an inferior diamond, and 
you have no use for it.

The carat weight of the diamond will be important to 
your customer. Large diamonds should come with 
a certificate. You should request this from the 
company that you are purchasing the diamond from. 
If they refuse to give you a certificate from a 
reputable grading company such as GIA, walk 
away. 

The chances are good that you will put more work 
and thought into purchasing diamonds for your 
jewelry wholesale than in any other gem or stone. 
Diamonds are by far the most popular gemstones 
in the world – and with good reason. Not only are 
they the most beautiful stones, but they are also 
the most durable stones on the face of the earth – 
or under the earth for that matter!
