Are Diamonds Really Rare?

When you walk into a jewelry store and see 
all the diamonds in all of the various settings 
that are for sale, it is difficult to realize that 
diamonds are indeed rare. Most people 
don’t even stop to consider how that 
diamond came to be sitting in that jeweler’s 
case! There is quite a bit of work that is done
before a diamond is ready to sell to the 
general public!

For every one million diamonds that are 
mined, only one will be found that is a quality 
one caret diamond. In order to find a two 
caret diamond, about five million diamonds 
must be mined. More than two hundred tons 
of ore must be mined to find one small 
diamond, and even then, more than 80% 
of the diamonds that are mined are only 
good for industrial use, such as diamond 
drill bits.

So, the next time you visit your local jewelry 
store, ask to see the one carat diamonds. 
You should look at this diamond with new 
appreciation – knowing that it truly is one 
in a million!
