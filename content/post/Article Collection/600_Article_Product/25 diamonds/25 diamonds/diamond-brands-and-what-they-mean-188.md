Diamond Brands and What They Mean

Diamonds are one of the few products that 
simply cannot be ‘branded.’ Even though 
there are different cuts, different grades, and 
different values placed on each and every 
diamond in existence, no diamond is any 
specific brand – just as gold is not a specific 
brand. 

Branding is actually based on who owns the 
diamond. For instance, if DeBeers owns the 
diamond, it is a DeBeers Diamond – but it is 
still just a diamond. If the diamond was cut by 
a specific well known cutter, then it might be 
branded in that way as well – but it usually 
isn’t. It is still branded based on who owns it 
at the time. So basically, when it comes down 
to it – diamond brands mean absolutely 
nothing at all. 

Do not allow a jeweler to try to talk you into 
paying an exorbitant price on a diamond 
because it is a specific brand. This is a bit 
of trickery used by unscrupulous jewelers 
when they know that they are dealing with 
people who don’t know much about 
diamonds. Remember that diamonds are 
not actually branded – unless mother nature 
has her own brand!
