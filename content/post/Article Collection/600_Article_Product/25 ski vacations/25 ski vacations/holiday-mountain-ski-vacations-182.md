Holiday Mountain Ski Vacations

Holiday Mountain, located in New York, is a popular 
area for skiing. Even though the highest elevation is 
only 1300 feet, and the vertical drop is only 400 feet, 
this area is a popular place for the younger crowd, 
and it is definitely a great place to learn how to ski.

There are eight lifts, including three chair lifts and five 
surface lifts. There are 15 trails for beginners, 
intermediate skiers, and expert skiers. While skiing 
and snowboarding are the main attractions, there is 
much more here as well, including bumper cars, an 
arcade, and a mechanical bull. There is always 
something to do at Holiday Mountain Ski Resort.

The best place to stay when visiting Holiday Mountain 
Ski Resort is the Villa Roma Resort Hotel, which is 
located in the Sullivan County Catskills. Villa Roma 
was named as one of Americaâ€™s 50 Best Family 
Resorts by Better Homes & Garden Magazine, and 
with the amazing amount of fun activities, it is easy 
to see why. The resort features a rail park for 
snowboarders, birthday packages, snow tubing, and 
of course skiing.
