Italy Ski Vacations

If you will be in Italy, you should definitely visit 
Limone. Limone is one of Italy’s oldest ski areas, 
and it is a very old village with a twelfth century 
church and many other old buildings. The town is 
located near the French border, and is only about 
thirty miles from Nice. 

At Limone, you will experience a real taste of old 
Italy. The nightlife has a lot to offer, and the gourmet 
food is out of this world! Food and skiing are 
everything here – with more than fifty restaurants, 
and 46 ski runs. The top elevation is 6689 with a 
vertical drop of 3033 feet. Most of the runs are best 
suited to intermediate skiers, with a few that are 
suitable for beginners and experts. There are twenty 
seven lifts, including seven chair lifts and twenty 
surface lifts.

Remember that the village is very old – and the 
locales like it that way. If you prefer high technology 
and modern buildings, Limone probably isn’t for you. 
But if you want to truly experience Italy, Limone 
must be on your list of places to visit in Italy.
