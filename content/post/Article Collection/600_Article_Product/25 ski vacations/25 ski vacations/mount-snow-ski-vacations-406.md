Mount Snow Ski Vacations

Mount Snow, located in Vermont, is the one of the 
largest ski resorts in the Eastern United States. 
Featuring 26 lifts and more than 135 trails, the top 
elevation at Mount Snow is 3600 feet, with a vertical 
drop of 1700 feet. There are 20 chair lifts and six 
surface lifts available.

Snowboarders are welcome at Mount Snow, and 
there is a ‘kids only’ terrain park as well as a special 
tubing park. The Grand Summit Hotel and Crown Club 
sits right off the slopes, and guests enjoy a heated 
outdoor pool and ski in/ski out accommodations. There 
is something to suit everyone at Mount Snow.

Many different winter ski vacation packages are 
available. Many of these packages are really great 
deals designed to save families money. Child care is 
available at Mount Snow, and the youngsters will be 
well cared for, and learn to ski as well. The adults 
aren’t left out of the learning process either! Both group 
and private lessons are available.

Mount Snow is very family oriented. At Mount Snow 
a unique ‘back-to-base’ trail system is used that 
keeps everyone in your family from getting lost. Kids 
under six ski and ride for free. When an adult buys a 
3 - 5 day ticket during mid-week, their kid receives a 
free ticket for that same time period as well. During 
January, the Kids Ski & Learn Free weeks seem to 
be the most popular family deals.

Mount Snow features a full service health spa that 
you should take full advantage of. A variety of 
massages are offered, as well as various skin 
treatments. Spa packages are also available, and the 
spa caters to couples as well, and wedding parties are 
also welcome.  There is also a fully equipped health 
club and fitness classes are offered. There is always 
something to do at Mount Snow – even if doing 
nothing but relaxing is on your agenda!

Winter activities at Mount Snow also include 
snowmobiling, snowshoeing, tubing, cross country 
skiing, and sleigh rides. There is a ski shop on the 
premises and rental equipment is available. There are 
several restaurants and bars on the mountain to 
choose from as well. Again, Mount Snow is family 
oriented. You will find that this is a very safe environment 
for your entire family, where you can relax and have fun 
– without any worry. Be sure to ask about the family deals 
when you call for reservations or information.
