Romance In Newport Beach

It's no secret that finding a honeymoon location or
a place to take your sweetheart is important.  With 
many places to choose from, you may be surprised to
hear that Newport Beach is actually one of the most
romantic - yet also one of the most overlooked areas
in the entire United States.

For honeymooners or those in love looking to re-kindle
the flame, Newport Beach has a lot to offer when it 
comes to romance.  The entire environment and setting
around the Beach is romantic, with romance budding at 
each and every turn.

On a hot day, walking hand in hand down Marine Avenue
on Balboa Island is enriching.  You and your mate can
check out the sites and talk about things.  Then, you 
can head over to Balboa Fun Zone and play games together,
enjoying the best life has to offer.  To show her that
you care, you can even win her a stuffed animal - one
thing that all females seem to love!

On the harbor of Newport Beach, a romantic gondola ride
remains one of the most romantic things to do.  A gondola
ride is great to relax, sitting back with one and another
and enjoying the best of the beach.  Sometimes, nothing
beats just enjoying the presence of one another and
taking in some of the best sites that vision has to offer.

Once night begins to set in, nothing is more romantic 
than a trip to the Bayside Restaurant or the Aubergine,
two of the most romantic restaurants in Orange County.  
Both you and your partner will enjoy the setting here, as
well as the food.

After you have enjoyed a romantic dinner, you can watch
the sun rise on the beach.  Both sunrise and sunset is
breathtaking at Newport Beach, something each and every 
couple should experience at least once in a lifetime.

Before you call it a trip, you should also make sure to
get pampered at a local spa.  The spa's around Newport
Beach are exhiarating, something your whole body will 
find superb.  As a couple or a separate trip, a relaxing
day at the spa is very hard to rival.

When it comes to a honeymoon or a trip as a couple, 
Newport Beach is one location you'll remember the rest of
your lives.  There is so much to do here as a couple, 
you'll probably want to come back again and again.  As 
time goes by and you get older, you'll find that Newport
Beach is the perfect place to come back to - no matter
where the road of life takes you.
