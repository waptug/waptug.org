Newport Beach Gondola Ride

Over 800 years old, the gondola is a regarded as a
symbol of romance.  Although thinking of a gondola
may bring thoughts of Venice Italy, the gondola
ride found in Newport Beach can be just as romantic
when it comes to the symbol of romance.

Once you sit in the black yet sleek gondola, you'll 
be steered into the fairy-tale setting of the 
hidden canals beyond Newport Beach.  Most of the
time, the individual steering the gondola will 
appear discreet yet mysterious, hearing nothing 
and saying nothing.  

With this sense, the boat will almost appear to 
be moving by magic, gliding along with nothing to
disturb the soft music.  Occasionally, you can 
hear the splashing of a fish breaking the surface
of the water, which actually adds to the music and
the tempo of the gondola ride.

With the gondola floating so close to the surface
of the water, you'll feel as if every sense you have
is being tapped.  The warmth of the sun, the smell
of the water, and the lapping of the waves will set
your mind off like never before.

As you travel through the canals, you'll find 
yourself wondering if the houses are deserted and 
just how romantic the atmosphere and setting make 
you feel.  Even though you may have the urge to 
dangle your fingers in the water, the relaxing feel
of the gandola will make you feel as if you are
too relaxed to move a muscle!

When the sun sets, you'll pass other gandolas as
they travel through the canals.  On a couple ride,
the gandola can help to rekindle the flame or just
take you to a whole new world.  Once you return to 
the docks, you'll probably find yourself wishing 
that the ride would never end.

If you've never experienced a gondola ride, it's one
thing that you simply must try.  As a wedding ride,
honeymoon ride, couple ride, or just a couple of 
friends, the gondola ride is something that will
make you feel as never before.

While there are a few providers of gondola rides in
Newport Beach, each one offers you the ride of a 
lifetime. The gondola ride brings a touch of romance
to Newport Beach, which is something each and every
couple should have the pleasure of experiencing.

If you plan on visiting Newport Beach or if you 
already live in the area, a gondola ride is something
you shouldn't hesitate to try.  It brings a whole new
sense to the word romance and can easily make you
forget everything that has troubled you in life - if
even for a brief moment.
