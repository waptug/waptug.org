were around back in the early 1900's, which is
great to see for anyone who wants to see what the
past was like or to learn more about the history
behind Newport Beach.

is the first landmark for Newport Beach.  Built in
1905, the pavilion was the end of the line for the
Red Car of the Pacific Electric.  Now days, the

chartering company, and even a restaurant.
