Working MLM genealogy leads can be an effective method of building your network marketing business.

They could be a wholesale customer or not working the business. They could be inactive and may even be out of the industry altogether.

One of the biggest threats to working MLM genealogy leads is the Do-Not-Call Registry. Recently, the number of phone numbers registered under Do-Not-Call Registry surpassed 100 million. That number is significant, because the Registry has only been in operation for over two years.

Apparently, these people are getting wiser into the kind of marketing being offered everyday. Some of the opinions based on generalizations and experience may be.

One study run over 100,000 MLM genealogy leads through the DNC scrubbing process. It was found out that approximately one-third of the people on the list were on the Do-Not-Call Registry. 
In the North Eastern states, that number even reached up to over 50%.

Even with these downsides, there are still plenty of reasons to work MLM genealogy leads. They are very inexpensive when compared to most MLM lead sources. If you happen to land a big player, it can be the best thing that could ever happen to your business.

It can be noted that MLM leads are the lifeblood of many network marketers.
 
Over the years, MLM leads have become a key component of building a downline. As the demand for MLM leads has grown, the quality of MLM Leads has suffered. 

Many lead capture pages are designed to get anyone to fill out the form. Some list brokers have sold their MLM leads several times, causing the people who filled out a form inquiring about a business opportunity to get bombarded with phone solicitations.

Some of these people who are on MLM leads put down false information, register with the Do Not Call Directory, and will say they never filled out a form. This is done just so they will be left alone. But in reality, they still are interested in a business opportunity. They just want it at their own time and when they are ready for it.

There are many ways to grow your business. Working MLM genealogy leads is one of the major methods for this. There are also many types of leads, as well as a plethora of leads companies.
