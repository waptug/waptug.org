Simplicity and duplicity in networking MLM


Ask some of the more successful MLM marketers and they will tell you that the key factor in networking MLM is simplicity. 

Networking MLM is a very simple business. But keeping it simple does not mean that hard work is not involved. One of the common mistakes is that people try to make it complicated.

Even if a complex system achieved great results for you, others will find it difficult to copy. In networking MLM, personal success is not your greatest asset. 

Your greatest asset is having a system that guarantees the success of everyone using it. The success of others, and your success, is dependant upon their ability to do the same things you do. Keep the least experienced of those in your network in mind when you set up a system of doing things for your organization to follow.

Everything you do must be simple enough so that everyone can quickly duplicate your efforts and achieve the same phenomenal results as you.

In MLM networking, you should not do things that require special skills, resources which are available only to you or to a limited number of people. Open up your business to a much larger pool of people who can become successful.
You need to build your network as quickly as possible. You can only meet with a few people each day and can personally close even fewer sales. 

But using an MLM networking strategy, you can help others quickly learn to do the same simple things as you. When they do, they multiply your efforts.

Go for the same phenomenal results. This is quality duplication. Each person in your MLM networking, from top to bottom, must be able to exactly duplicate what you are doing and be able to teach others to do exactly the same thing. How large a sales team you can build depends on how well it is duplicated.

To ensure duplication, you need a system or processes that anybody and everybody can follow and teach. You cannot duplicate a person but you can duplicate a system. 

In building a successful and long-term network, the MLM networking system must rule. Remember a system is only as good as it is duplicated. 

The more complex a system, the less likely quality duplication will be achieved. To make sure you duplicate well, follow the System you are provided with religiously. There is no perfect system and your time is better spent perfecting your ability to duplicate it rather than perfecting a system.

Take this example. Ray Krocs, the founder of MacDonald’s cannot be duplicated but the MacDonald’s franchise system can be and is, to almost 100% perfection in 18,000 outlets worldwide.

Keeping it simple. To ensure you do things that your distributor can learn from and duplicate.
 
Is what I am doing easily duplicable? 
Is it simple enough to be duplicated? Keep asking yourself this same questions and if you answer “yes” at least 75 % of the time, you are on the right track.

The most successful people in MLM networking business understand that everything must be kept simple in order to grow your business. Show others how simple it is to do what you do. They need to see you do it, and then believe it is simple enough for them to quickly duplicate to achieve the same good results in your MLM networking.
