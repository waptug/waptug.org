Traits to look for in an MLM consultant


MLM consultants have gotten to be a popular figure in the network marketing business. There are many good ones out there, and there are not so good ones as well. You must know what to look for, before you spend a dime on them.

You should know that some MLM consultants are actually network marketers that say they are consultants. You must understand that consulting is a career and profession that demands many things.
 
Being a network marketer does not automatically qualify one as an expert, even if they have had great success in MLM. Maybe they were just in the right place at the right time and with the right people. That can happen also.

Here are five things to look for in a good MLM consultant.

1. A track record that is available for inspection.

Any good MLM consultant will keep their track record available for any kind of inspection by a future client. They have nothing to hide, they do not want to in the first place. The results they have accomplished speak for themselves.

Ask them if they have some clients you could talk to or get some kind of testimonial. Track records in consulting can mean the difference between spending money and getting little or spending money and getting a lot. Check what they have done and not what they said they have done. 

2. Check for their credentials.

What kind of solid credentials do they have that would warrant you spending money with them? What kind of education about MLM do they have? What are their work experiences? Do they have the right business experience? Have they ever run a business before? What kind of degree do they have?

Credentials are important in modern day consulting. This is not only for you but also for the results you seek from an MLM consultant. Most consultants have a portfolio they can show you. Ask for it and study it.

3. Look for professionalism.

Professionalism is a must in any field of consulting. Do they come across as a professional? Do they speak as a professional? Do they communicate in a professional manner? 

Being a professional speaks well of a consultant. Do they do their business with a smile on their face? These questions will tell a lot about an MLM consultant and how they will handle things in any future venture.

4) Problem solver.

Do they ask questions that are focused on your problem, or questions that are focused on being a consultant?

There are many questions that consultants ask that are all part of being an MLM consultant. You are looking to hire them to solve a problem, not be a consultant. Make sure their questions are focused on moving you forward, not just creating conversation.

That is what MLM consultants get paid for- to solve problems, not to engage in a fruitless exercise.

5) Experienced in the MLM business.

It is true that there are MLM consultants that have never spent an hour in the MLM field. They have never recruited anyone. They have never sold a product in MLM. They have never held a Company Event for a team. They have never done a presentation around a kitchen table, or a home meeting. But yet, they consider themselves as an MLM consultant.

Make sure that the MLM consultant has some experience in the field, as that alone brings a wealth of knowledge that many do not have.
