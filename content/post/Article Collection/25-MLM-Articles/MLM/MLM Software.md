How do you choose the right MLM software for you? 


With the many MLM software out there already, how do you choose the one that is right for you?

Choose a reputable vendor. 

There are many fly-by-night software companies that make many claims of experience, know how and MLM software gadgetry. Unless you are willing to put your business at risk, choose a vendor that has a proven track record. 

Track records are built over many years of working with Direct Selling companies, not just selling a software package a few times. 

Check out at least six references. Remember that vendors will be eager to provide only their best references. You might be surprised to find a different story when you call companies not included in the reference list.

Visit the MLM software company's office. 

You not only choose the MLM software but also choose the vendor's support services. If the vendor is not able to provide support services acceptably, what will you do when you need to change your compensation plan or add a new input field to the order entry screen? 

Remember that there is only one constant among all MLM companies; they constantly change things. And your MLM software will need to be changed as well.

At the vendor's office, meet the vendor's people that will service you. See what kind of people they are and how long they have worked for the vendor. Be willing to pay for experience and competence. You are paying far less in the long run. 

Avoid small MLM software companies. 

Small software companies, to compete with larger established firms, must offer software at bargain prices. This often puts them on shaky financial ground during their most critical years.
 
Companies that are trying to save money by purchasing an MLM software from these small software houses find themselves virtually abandoned later on when they need assistance. The problem is that servicing one highly successful client can consume virtually all of the human resources of a small software company leaving the other clients out in the cold. 

The more deadly problem is that smaller companies tend to go out of business without warning. If you value your business, stay away from the small vendors and stick to those with staying power and track records.

Buy an MLM software package that allows you to create your own reports. 

Many packages force you to live only with those reports they put on the menus. Managers must resort to running large reports to answer small questions or concerns instead of small exception reports on demand. Small exception reports can be reviewed quickly and accurately. 

Compare features.

MLM software is designed to handle specific business issues and often has a great deal of difficulty dealing with matters outside the original design. It's difficult to force a software to do things it was never intended to do. 

Wise computer buyers compare features and capabilities, side by side, of one package to another. Ask the vendor which features they consider are unique to their package compared to others. 

Remember that you are not just buying a computer; you are buying software, expertise, emergency support services, programming services, and starting a long-term relationship. 

Choose your MLM software vendor wisely. Do not be tempted to penny pinch in the computer area. If you do, you may cripple your chances for success.
