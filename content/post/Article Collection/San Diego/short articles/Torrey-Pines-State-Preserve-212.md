Torrey Pines State Preserve

Located at the Northwest end of San Diego, within
the city limits, Torrey Pines offers you over 2000
wild and natural acres.  Along with the trees of 
Torrey Pines, there's a visitor center, miles and 
miles of trails, miles of beaches, and a lagoon
that's a vital area for seabirds.

The State Preserve of Torrey Pines not only preserves
the trees but the salt marshes and waterfowl refuges
as well.  The Torrey Pines State Beach here stretches
nearly four miles, from Del Mar to the sandstone 
cliffs of Torrey Pines Mesa.

Also found here is Blacks Beach, located at the 
base of the 300 foot cliffs.  The cliffs here offer
paragliding, remote control gliding, and even hang
gliding. At the north end of Blacks Beach, clothing 
is optional.  To be on the safe side, always read the
signs and follow the rules of the beach.

With plenty to offer, Torrey Pines State Preserve is
a great addition to the already vast area of San
Diego.  You can visit here from San Diego, as it's 
a short drive away.  Torrey Pines has great beaches
and plenty of trails for you to see.  As a family 
trip, Torrey Pines is a great place to spend the
afternoon on your once in a lifetime vacation.
