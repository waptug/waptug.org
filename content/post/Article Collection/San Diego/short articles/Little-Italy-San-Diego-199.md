Little Italy San Diego

Little Italy in San Diego is rapidly evolving as an
inner city neighborhood that's perfect to live in,
shop, dine, or visit.  The Little Italy offers great
views of the bay, art and cultural festivities, and
great food.  

The nearby street sign for Little Italy, created in
1999, signals that the area is the heart and soul
of San Diego's inner community.  The sign is truly
a signal of peace, and can be found on India Street
between Date and Fir.

Each and every year, there are nearly a dozen festivals
held in Little Italy.  There are tons of holiday 
celebrations, music, and art expo's.  During this 
time, Little Italy comes alive like never before.

The heart of Little Italy is India Street.  This 
street has plenty of outdoor cafes, restaurants, 
galleries, and specialty shops.  Nearby Amici Park
offers a playground for the Washington Elementary
School and a community park that's complete with
a bocce ball court.

Bigger than the Little Italy neighborhoods in New 
York and San Francisco, San Diego's Little Italy
keeps getting bigger and better.  The waterfront 
district of San Diego is bouncing back with Little
Italy, proving to be a great place for tourist
attraction.
