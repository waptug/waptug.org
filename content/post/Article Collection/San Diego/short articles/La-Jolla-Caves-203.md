La Jolla Caves

Along with the beaches La Jolla gives the San Diego
area, it also has some very nice caves.  The caves
of La Jolla are great for tours, exploring, or 
anyone wanting to see the best of La Jolla.

Carved into the sandstone cliffs of La Jolla, there
are seven caves.  Most of the time, you can visit 
any seven of these caves by sea kayak.  Although
all but one are accessible by foot, you should be
very carefully when minus tides sweep the area.

The Sunny Jim Cave is one of the most popular and
well known caves of La Jolla.  You can enter 
through the Cave Store by paying a small fee.  There
are 145 steep steps to get through the cave,
which is great for exploring and seeing the area.

The cave store can tell you many things about the
caves, including tours.  If you plan to visit the
La Jolla area of San Diego, the caves can be a great
place to explore.  Those of you who have kids coming
along for the trip, should remember to be very
careful - as the caves provide a lot of beauty -
they can also provide a lot of danger as well.
