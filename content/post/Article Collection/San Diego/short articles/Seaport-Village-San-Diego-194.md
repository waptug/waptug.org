Seaport Village San Diego

The Seaport Village of San Diego combines the best
of waterfront shopping, dining, and overall family
entertainment.  While the Marina Park is here as 
well, nearby is the small but popular San Diego
public park.  

In Seaport Village you'll find 14 acres of pleasure
with more than 75 shops and galleries, restaurants, 
and eateries on the sidewalk.  Even though the area
is primarily targeted towards visitors, locals get
the best of the best with the restaurants and their
out of town company.

The San Diego Pier Cafe is also here, which is one of
the best known restaurants in the area.  Located on
the bay, the cafe provides seafood with breathtaking
views.  

The Seaport village provides a great place to view 
Coronado and the Coronado Bridge, as it overlooks the
harbor.  Just a short stroll from the village, you have
the San Diego Convention Center, Petco Park, and 
the Gaslamp Quarter.  

Providing plenty to do and plenty of things to see
nearby, Seaport Village has it all going on.  A visit
here is unlike any other, as the city of San Diego
will always have something unique to offer you and your
entire family.
