San Diego At A Glance

Referred to as many as being the only area in the 
United States with perfect weather, San Diego remains
the oldest port on the West Coast.  Complete with a 
well known Naval Base and a high level of tourism, this
breathtaking city continues to dominate the economy.

Aside from offering high mountains, deserts, and over 
70 miles of the world's most renowned beaches, San Diego
also offers other great attractions such as Sea World,
the San Diego Zoo, and Wild Animal Park.

For art lovers, there are many different museums and
even the Shakespearean play at the Old Globe Theater. 
Throw in the fact that San Diego has more championship
golf courses than any other area in the world, and you
have a city ready for anyone's imagination.

As a tourist city or a place to call home, San Diego is
one place you should at least visit.  The night life here
rivals that of Las Vegas, giving you something for 
everyone in the family.  Young or old - San Diego is the
one city that you'll never find boring.
