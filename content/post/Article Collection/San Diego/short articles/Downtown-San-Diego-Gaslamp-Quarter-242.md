Downtown San Diego Gaslamp Quarter

The Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego contains some of
the most extensive and dramatically designed 
historic buildings in the area.  Constructed between
1873 and 1930, these Victorian style buildings are
truly a sight to behold.

The Victorian era buildings found in the Gaslamp 
Quarter are home to night clubs, restaurants,
theaters, and shops.  A simple stroll down 4th 
and 5th avenue will put you at the heart of the
Gaslamp Quarter.  

Also found in the Gaslamp Quarter is the Horton 
Plaza and Horton Plaza Park.  The Plaza is the 
first place in the United States to feature a water
fountain containing electric lights; a true 
tribute to the designer Alonzo Horton.

The Gaslamp Quarter received its name from the
gaslamps that were used in the area around the early
1900's.  During those times, gaslamps were the 
main source of light for the area that is now
the vision of Modern Day San Diego.

Now days, there are more than 130 stores and shops
filling the Gaslamp Quarter.  With everything from
Macy's to Mervyns, Gaslamp Quarter has plenty for
you to see and do.  In Horton Plaza, you can find
a multi screen movie theater that is sure to please
movie lovers.

For a wonderful experience, the Gaslamp Quarter of
San Diego shouldn't be overlooked.  There is a lot
you can do here, from fine dining to excellent 
shops.  For a family vacation, San Diego has a
little bit of something for everyone.
