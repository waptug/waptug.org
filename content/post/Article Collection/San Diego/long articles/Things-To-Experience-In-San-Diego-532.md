Things to Experience in San Diego

Visiting San Diego for the first time can be quite overwhelming, 
especially when you consider that there are so many things you 
can do.  Deciding where to go and what to do can be quite time
consuming, which is where we can help.  Below, you'll find the 8 
best spots in San Diego - things you simply must experience.

1.  Hitting the beach.
	No matter what season you visit, the beach is one area that
personifies the entire San Diego lifestyle. Whether your watching 
the tide come in or soaking in the sun, the beach is where the 
action is.  From Mission Beach to the Belmont Park rollercoaster -
make sure you hit the beaches here.

2.  Trying a fish taco.
	Although it may sound a bit weird, the fish taco is one
of the best foods in San Diego.  Deep fried, battered fish encased 
in a corn tortilla is one of the foods that once you try it the 
first time - you'll crave anytime you come back!  

3.  Going to Mexico.
	It's no secret that San Diego borders Mexico, with Tijuana 
being a metropolis in its own right.  Visting Tijuana or Baja Mexico
is perfectly safe day or night, no matter what you have heard.  Keep
in mind that they have their own laws, bring your passport, then
enjoy everything that this foreign paradise will provide you with.

4.  Take a ride on the trolley.
	San Diego doesn't have the best public transit system, yet
they do have the well known trolley.  The highways here can be quite
intimidating, making the trolley the ideal way to travel.  If you 
want to learn more about the city, simply buy an all day trolley 
pass - you'll see more of San Diego this way than you ever thought
possible.

5.  Visiting the Pandas.
	While Sea World and Legoland has their share of animals, the
San Deigo zoo is no stranger to Pandas.  The zoo is a tourist attraction,
with the baby Su Lin, which is quite a feast for the eyes.  When you
visit the San Diego Zoo, visit in the morning - when the pandas are 
most active.

6.  Balboa Park.
	After you check out the pandas, take a trip to the jewel of 
the city - Balboa Park.  The atmosphere is breathtaking here, no matter
when you visit.  If you visit on Tuesdays however; you'll find that 
most museums have free admission.  After you visit a while, dine at the 
Prado Restauraunt and experience great food in a great setting.

7.  Gaslamp and the nightlife.
	The Gaslamp Quarter in downtown San Diego is the place to be
for dancing, eating, or just people watching.  You can experience the
best of life in San Diego here, with food to fit every taste.

8.  The Old Town.
	While historical San Diego isn't always apparent, a visit to the
Old Town State Historic Park can bring back the past.  There are snippets 
of Old San Diego found everywhere you look here.  Although there are many
fine restaurants here, make sure you visit the Old Town Mexican Cafe, as
it serves the best Mexican food around San Diego.
