Old Town San Diego

The Old Town San Diego Park serves as a way to recreate 
life in both the early American and early Mexican era
of 1821 - 1872.  Perfectly situated in San Diego, the
park helps to recreate what was once San Diego.  No
matter how you look at it, a trip to California isn't
complete without a visit to the Old Town.

Around the five adobes of the main complex, there are
shops, a museum, and several restaurants.  Around the
garden courtyard, the La Casa mansion helps to bring
back a taste of the Old Town.  Just a short hop from
there, the museum is full of artifacts that help to
reflect on the life that was once the Old Town.

The Old Town also has a blacksmith shop, schoolhouse,
and several other historic buildings, including the 
first newspaper office in San Diego.  This is truly
a place to visit, especially for those who are wanting
to learn more about the history of San Diego.

The city of San Diego was the first Spanish settlement
in California.  This occurred when a fort and mission 
were established in 1769.  Back in 1769, California 
was just beginning to get established, therefore it
wasn't near the state nor the size that it is today.

When visiting the Old Town Park, you should make sure
to visit the Robinson-Rose House Visitor Center.  This
center is reconstructed now and displays a model of 
Old Town and the way it looked back in 1872.  The model
that is on display was created by Joseph Toigo.

The Old Town Park also offers exhibits of the way things
used to be, programs, and even guided tours.  You can
get a personal tour of the park, with a guide who
will show you around and even explain things to you.

During your visit to the park, you can also enjoy a 
picnic at one of the picnic areas or get something to
eat from one of many vendors.  There are supplies here
as well, including restrooms.

Those living in San Diego can find the Old Town Park 
on San Diego Avenue and Twiggs Street.  Being close to
the main city, visiting the Park is easier than you may
think.  If you live in the city but have never been to
the park, you should stop by and take a look.

On a vacation or a visit from town, the Old Town San
Diego helps to bring back a taste of the past.  There 
is a lot to see here and a lot of historical value.  All
you need to do is stop by the park and see what you
think about the way things used to be.
