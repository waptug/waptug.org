La Jolla San Diego

A sparkling jewel of San Diego, the La Jolla 
area is a picture perfect post card with several 
beaches along more than seven miles of coast 
against an array of rolling hills known as Mount 
Soledad.

Being a part of San Diego, La Jolla is only
15 minutes from the downtown district.  Along with
beautiful scenery, the area also offers many fine
restaurants, art galleries, hotels and resorts, 
and many other attractions such as the Scripps
Institution of Oceanography.

The Birch Aquarium is also a part of La Jolla, 
giving you the chance to enter the exciting world
of sharks, living coral reefs, and many other undersea
exhibits.  This aquarium showcases the mysteries of
the ocean and what actually lives there.

The shoreline of La Jolla consists of rocky headlands
seperated by pristine coves and sandy beaches.  All 
along the beach, you can find many different hotels
and resorts, designed to make your stay a little bit
better.

The North Pacific Beach extends to La Jolla, traveling
from the Crystal Pier in Pacific Beach.  If you travel
north of this area, you'll find yourself on the
beaches of La Jolla.

By going to the south end of the La Jolla shoreline,
you'll find Windandsea Beach.  Windandsea Beach has
long had a reputation for surfers paradise, although
the steep beaches and rocky cliffs can be very 
dangerous if you aren't aware of them.

Close to downtown La Jolla, there is an area called
Casa, which used to be a children's pool.  Now days,
the area has been taken over by seals and sealions.  
Although children can't swim here anymore, it's a 
great pastime to lay on the beach and watch them play.

Traveling along the La Jolla shoreline, you'll find
the tide pools.  These pools are great to look at, 
although you shouldn't touch them.  You should visit
during low tide and be sure to wear rubber soled shoes,
as they can get quite slippery.

The cove in La Jolla is very beautiful, although one
of the smaller beaches in San Diego.  On either side of 
the cove, there are sandstone cliffs.  This helps to 
add an isolated feel to the cove.

Throughout La Jolla, the Shores Beach is the widest and
longest beach.  If you look off to the distance on the
beach, you can see the Scripps Pier.  Also on the beach,
there are novice scuba classes held throughout the summer
months. 

With plenty to offer you and your family, the beaches of
La Jolla are among the best in San Diego.  There's plenty
to do and see here, with dining and swimming.  For a 
great visit to the beach, La Jolla seems to simplify the
best of life in California.
