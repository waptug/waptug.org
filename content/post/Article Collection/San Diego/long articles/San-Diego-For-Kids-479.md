San Diego For Kids

Although San Diego has many things for grown ups to
enjoy, it hasa lot of activities for kids to enjoy
as well.  Custom made for families, San Diego has
plenty of public parks, nice weather year round, 
several museums, and many things for children of all
ages to amuse themselves with.

For kids who love animals, there's the well known
San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Animal Park.  The zoo
is located in Balboa Park, while the park is located
a bit north of the city.  If you have the time, you
should take a full day for your kids to enjoy the park
and the zoo.  If the traditional zoo makes your kids
uncomfortable, the park is a great alternative.

Kids of all ages also enjoy the world famous Sea 
World, which is home to Shamu the killer whale and
several other marine animals and exhibits.  Sea World
has been a great attraction for kids for many years,
showing them the marine life like never before.

When it comes to the winter months, whale watching is
a very popular activity.  You can watch them from 
the coastline or take a cruise.  Watching the gray
whale is very amusing to kids, openening their minds
to new possibilities.

Balboa Park is a great place to visit as well, as it
has a lot more than the San Diego Zoo.  There are 
places for kids to explore, with the children's museum,
the Fleet Science Center, and the Natural History 
Museum.

Another popular park for kids is Legoland California,
which is located north of San Diego.  There are a lot
of things to see in this park, with a majority of 
the park being built from the popular Lego blocks.  
Overall, this is one of the best and most quiet options
for younger children.

Hitting the beach is great as well, as San Diego has
many different beaches for kids of all ages.  On the
beaches, kids can build sandcastles, rent boogie 
boards, or just enjoy the swimming that San Diego so
proudly displays.

Older kids will enjoy the true recreation mode for 
San Diego - roller skating and rollerblading.  Along
Mission Bay there are great spots, along with
playgrounds and parks.  You can fly kites here as 
well, which is a great break from the ordinary.

Amusement Parks are a great attraction in San Diego,
with Belmont Park being very popular.  There are many
rides here, amusing kids for hours on end.  The
Giant Dipper and the Plunge are among the best, for
younger or older kids.

If San Diego is on your family vacation list, rest 
assured that there will be plenty for your kids to 
do on your stay.  They will feel right at home with
the many things to do - while you your mate are 
occupied with plenty of things for you to do as 
well.
