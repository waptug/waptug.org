San Diego Wild Animal Park

Aside from the San Diego Zoo, the San Diego Wild
Animal Park is the best place in San Diego to see
animals.  Over the spread of 1,800 acres, the animal
park gives animals the room they need to roam and
play.  The animals here play just like they do in
the wild, which almost makes you feel as if you 
are in their native of Africa and Asia.

Throughout the 30 year history of the animal park, 
the Noah's Ark symbol of endangered species has grown
to dozens upon dozens of animals. Now, every Arabian
Oryx found in the wild is the descendant stock from the
San Diego Wild Animal Park.

In the park, there are many different paths you can
take to visit the smaller animal exhibits.  Although 
the smaller animals are a sight to see, the main 
thing to see is the hour long trip on the Bush Line 
Railway.  Along the railway, you'll see animals that
you'd never get the chance of seeing anywhere else,
such as the white rhino and the rhinoceros.

If you plan to visit the park in the summer, it's 
always a good idea to visit early.  On a normal summer
day, ten - fifteen thousand people will visit the
park.  During the winter, the ratio is down as 
normally 2,000 people will visit.  Although it's much
colder in the winter, the park is less frequent with
people looking to see the animals the park offers.

You can find the animal park 32 miles north of 
Escondido in San Diego.  The park is in a peaceful
area, which makes things a lot better for the animals
that live there.  

When visiting in the summer, it's a great idea to walk
a while, then take the railway.  After you have took 
the railway a bit, you can walk some more.  It's also 
good to take plenty of sunscreen with you as well, as
summer at the park can get very hot.  Water is great
as well, simply because the summer in California can
be a bit of a scorcher.

The San Diego Wild Animal Park is ran by the San Diego
Zoological Society.  The society also runs the San 
Diego Zoo, which is one of the most popular animal
parks in the entire world.  With the park and the zoo,
the society does more than its part to bring the 
best of seeing the animals to you.

The next time you are in San Diego or if you are 
visiting for the first time, the Wild Animal Park is
a great place to visit.  You can check out some truly
endangered species and learn more about the types of
animals that you'll see in this once in a lifetime
opportunity.
