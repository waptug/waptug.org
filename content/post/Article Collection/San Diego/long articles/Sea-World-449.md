Sea World

One of the biggest and most attractive features to
San Diego is Sea World.  Sea World is one of the most
popular amusement parks and also happens to be one of
the main reasons behind tourists.  Anyone who visits
San Diego has the intentions to visit Sea World - or
at least they should.

Being famous for Shamu the killer whale, Sea World has
the ability to entertain kids and adults for hours.  
There are many different animal shows here as well,
along with other amusement park thrills.  While Shamu 
is a must see, there are other animals here as well,
that you simply have to see.

Sea World also offers an exciting dolphin interaction
program where you can get in the water and play with
the dolphins.  This is a great learning experience, 
especially for those who love dolphins.  Dolphins are
an integral part of Sea World, as there are literally
hundreds of them here.

Once you visit Sea World, you'll go below the surface
and see life that you may have never before thought
possible.  You can feed the dolphins and other mammals,
even count the teeth that a shark has!  When you 
consider what Sea World has to offer, you simply can't
compare it to any other amusement park.

On the entertainment side of things, Sea World offers
a haunted lighthouse and several other rides and shows 
for you to see.  You can even get an all day pass here,
which is great for anyone who is wanting to enjoy all
that Sea World has to offer.

New to Sea World is Believe.  This is a new show that 
will show you Shamu like never before.  It's a journey
of wonder and magic that you simply must see to believe
and appreciate.

No matter what season of the year you visit, you'll be
happy to know that Sea World is open year round.  It 
does close on major holidays though, which isn't really
a bad thing.  As long as you don't visit on a holiday 
you can pretty much expect Sea World to be open.

On a vacation, Sea World in San Diego will have something
to please everyone.  The kids will have plenty to do 
here, while you experience things that interest you as 
well.  The neighboring areas to Sea World have plenty
to offer you as well, from dining to many different 
sights to see.

When the time comes for you to go on vacation you 
shouldn't pass up Sea World.  It's in a great location
with plenty of activities and things to see.  Sea World 
can show you the creatures of the sea like never 
before - which is reason enough to go.
