Coronado Island In San Diego

Everyone in California knows that the best beaches
in San Diego are on Coronado Island.  Being linked to
downtown San Diego by the Island Bay Bridge, Coronado
is home to the SEALs training center and the Naval
Air Station Coronado.  A military powerhouse, the
island of Coronado always has something going on.

One of the best features to Coronado is the world 
famous Hotel Del Coronado.  This Victorian style 
seaside hotel was established in 1888, and was easily
one of the biggest and best hotels of that era.  The
hotel was hosted in the past by the infamous Marilyn
Monroe and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.

The Hotel Del Coronado has some of the best service
in California, along with breathtaking views of the
San Diego area.  The restaurant here is one of the
best around, and even if you aren't staying here, you
can enjoy a great meal.  Each and every year, thousands
of people visit Coronado just to stay at this world
class hotel - yes, it's that good.

The Ferry Landing is also a great addition to what
Coronado Island has to offer.  The Ferry Landing 
Marketplace offers you 30+ shops, restaurants, and
art galleries.  You can walk around and check out
what the marketplace has to offer, or enjoy a 
visit to the Tidelands Park.

There are great places to walk and bicycle here,
with awesome views of skyline San Diego.  At sunset,
this is one of the best places to be.  On Tuesdays, you
can find a farmers market here as well.

The Coronado Beach is located here as well, along the
Travel Channel.  North of the beach there's the Best
Weekend Getaway Beach.  Even in the summer, the
Coronado Beach isn't crowded, giving your family plenty
of room to enjoy the splendors of one of California's
best beaches.

From the Glorietta Bay Inn in Coronado, you can take
a walking tour.  Tours leave several times a week, 
showing you everything the area has to offer.  This is
a great way to learn more about the area.  Or, if you
like, you can let someone else do the driving and
try a pedicab tour.

For the romantic, the Gondola Cruise helps to take the
pressure out of life.  A romantic spin through the
canals of Coronado Cays can be quite the break from
the ordinary.  

You can reach Coronado Island from San Diego by taking 
the Coronado Bay Bridge exit off I-5.  By water from
San Diego, you can take the Coronado Ferry that runs
hourly from 9 AM - 10 PM.  Walking from the Ferry 
Landing to Hotel Del Coronado is a little over a mile.
