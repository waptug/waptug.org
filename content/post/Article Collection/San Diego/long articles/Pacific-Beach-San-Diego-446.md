parks for you to experience.

Being out on the sand, you can experience the thrill of
horseshoes, the hot girls, dolphins playing in the water, 
and endless surf competitions in the summer.  The summer
is definately a little bit hotter when you are sitting in 
the ocean at Pacific Beach with your toes in the sand.

you'll always find something to do here.  Mission Bay is a
public park, offering the world famous Sea World, with

On the other hand, the Historic Crystal Pier offers a
taste of Southern California reinvented.  A walk along
the pier can bring back a taste of days gone by, coupled
with the lifestyle that only California can bring.

plenty of shops, fine dining, and California sand, this is
one area of San Diego that should be visited - time and 
time again!
