San Diego Whale Watching

It's no secret to anyone that the coast of San Diego
is the ideal place to watch the annual migration of 
the gray whale.  Looked upon as one of nature's ultimate
spectacles; the migration of gray whales is nothing 
short of breathtaking.  The coastline of San Diego is
one of their migratory points as they travel from the 
waters of the Arctic to the warmer regions of the Baja
(California), where females also give birth.

Every year, roughly 26,000 gray whales will make the 
long journey of 10,000+ miles from the Arctic to the Baja
and back.  If you look at this journey and compare it to 
any other mammal, you'll notice that the gray whale by 
far has the greatest amount of traveling at hand.

If you've never experienced whale watching, you'll be
happy to know that anyone will find it memorable - young
or old.  Spotting a gray whale along the coastline is
something that is truly a memorable moment, making you
stop for a second and truly appreciate these awesome
mammals.

If you ask the Birch Aquarium in San Diego, you'll find
that gray whales are seen most frequently from December
through March.  While they travel in dozens normally, 
it's nothing to see pods of them (2 - 3) as they travel
during migration.  Throughout the coast of San Diego,
you can easily spot these whales as they are somewhat
slow swimmers.

During their swimming, they will normally dive to a depth
of 100 feet or more for a few minutes, then surface and 
blow.  Then, they will do a few shallow dives, before 
making that deep dive again.  When watching whales, figuring
out this pattern makes the success of watching them all
the more fun and exciting.

While there are many common places to watch whales, 
nothing seems to compare to the excitement of watching them 
from aboard a cruise.  There are many cruises that take
place in San Diego, many of which offer unbeatable deals.
From H&M Landing to the Birch Aquarium, cruises are some of 
the best ways to see the beauty and tranquility of the
traveling gray whales.

The beauty of the gray whales can also be seen from many 
points of the San Diego coast, including the Cabrillo 
National Monument on Point Loma or the cliffs of Torrey Pines
State Beach.  Along these points, you can see the whales as 
they make their travels.

Whether it's a cruise or just watching from the coast, whale
watching in San Diego is something you truly have to see to
appreciate.  You can take your kids, family, or even your 
friends.  Whale watching can definately be exciting, all you
have to do is plan your day and enjoy everything that the
beauty of the gray whale will provide you with.
