Ocean Beach San Diego

Located in the Ocean Beach Community, Ocean Beach is 
actually just south of the entrance to the Mission 
Bay channel.  Located at 1950 Abbott Street, the beach
is a very popular location in the summer.  During the
winter months, couples like to walk the beach and 
just bask in the presence.

The Ocean Beach is wide in structure, about a mile
long.  Along the north end of the beach, you'll find
a volleyball court.  During the summer, the court is
always teeming with people playing volleyball while
the sand around it is teeming with people watching.

At the south end of the beach you'll find the Ocean
Beach Municipal Pier.  The Pier is open to the public
with plenty of walking and fishing available.  Located
on the pier is a bait and tackle shop along with a 
restaurant.  Although you don't need a fishing license
to fish off the dock, catch regulations are enforced.

If you walk to the south end of the beach you'll find 
many restaurants, surfing shops, and many other commercial
shops and establishments.  Although you can travel to
the north end of Ocean Beach, it's mostly bordered by
residents of the ocean area.

The unique part of Ocean Beach is the Dog Beach, located
at the north end.  This sandy area is where dogs can
run and play without a leash - anytime - day or night.
Although dog owners are responsible for their dogs and
the clean up of them, Dog Beach is actually pretty 
nifty for anyone who owns dogs.

For your protection along the beach, lifeguards are
out each and every day, year round.  They are generally
on duty from 9 AM until dark although you can check with
them for their specific hours of operation.  They are 
there for your protection and very willing to answer
any question that you may have.

Keep in mind while on the beach, California beaches do
experience powerful rip currents.  It's because of these
currents that beaches in California experience over
1,000 rescues by lifeguards every year.  To be on the
safe side while in San Diego at Ocean Beach, it's
always a good idea to swim near a lifeguard.

For those who like surfing, surfing is permitted at
Ocean Beach in designated areas.  Scuba isn't recommended
however, because of the lack of undersea life, heavy
rip currents, and the surf.  

For swimming or enjoying the California lifestyle, Ocean
Beach is a great place to go.  It is a very popular
place in the summer, drawing hundreds of thousands of
people.  If you long for a taste of the California 
lifestyle, make sure you visit Ocean Beach in San 
Diego.
