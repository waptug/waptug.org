Belmont Park In San Diego

Located in sunny San Diego, the Belmont Park is one
of the best amusement parks in San Diego.  With plenty
for the entire family, this Park has something for
everyone.  With rides for the entire family and basically
everything in between, Belmont Park makes for a very
exciting adventure.

The most distinctive attraction in the Park is the Giant 
Dipper Roller Coaster.  The coaster was built in 1925 and
has been restored over the years.  This coaster is truly
one of a kind, as it offers quick drops, steep hills, 
and insane speed!

Belmont Park in San Diego also offers the endless wave,
which is perfect for wave riders.  The Flowrider offers
hourly rides, even lessons for beginners.  If waves 
aren't your sort of thing, you may find the raceway bumper
cars or the Chaos enticing.  Chaos resembles a ferris 
wheel, although it creates a random three dimensional
rocking and rolling.  Anytime you get on it, no two rides
are every the same!

For arcade enthusiasts, there is a family fun arcade and
gamelords.  This creates the ultimate gaming experience,
keeping kids, teenagers, and even adults occupied for
hours on end.  

Other rides at the park include the Vertical plunge, krazy
kars, and the infamous "plunge".  The plunge is a great
attraction, and actually happens to be the largest indoor
heated pool in San Diego.  Perfect for swimming, diving,
and just enjoying yourself, the plunge is a blast.

To feel the sensation, the Crazy Submarine and the 
Trampoline can help you.  To truly test your limits, the
Rock Wall will offer a unique challenge.  Anyone wanting
to give it a try, can get to climbing the wall and see if 
they truly have what it takes to get to the top.

Once you've had your fill on rides, there are plenty of
other entertainment and events to keep you occupied.  In
Belmont Park, there is always something going on.  With
San Diego being a tourist attraction, you can bet the
entertainment in Belmont Park is nothing short of 
spectacular.

deals on birthday parties or private parties.  If you 
decide to have a party here, you can pretty much rent a
chunk of the park for yourself.  For kids, this can truly
be an unforgettable memory.

Saturday 11 AM - 10 PM and Sunday 11 AM - 8 PM.  Although

the weekends and enjoy the best in entertainment.
