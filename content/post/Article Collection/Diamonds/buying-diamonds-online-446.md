Buying Diamonds Online

With all of the potential for scams concerning 
diamonds, buying diamonds online almost 
seems unthinkable! However, you actually 
can purchase diamonds online, without any 
problems – as long as you are careful.

First, think about your reasons for wanting to 
purchase the diamond online, as opposed to 
making a purchase from a local jewelry store. 
The most common reason is price. Due to 
low overhead costs, online jewelers and 
wholesalers are able to offer lower prices. 
However, you must be careful – sometimes 
a price that is too low is a sure indication of 
a scam.

One of the best things about purchasing 
online is the unlimited selection. When 
shopping offline, you are limited to the 
selection in the stores in your general area. 
Online, there are no limits. But again, you 
must use a great deal of care and 
consideration before handing your money 
over to someone that you cannot see and 
have never met!

Before shopping, learn as much as you can 
about diamonds – especially cut, color, 
clarity and carat weights. When you are 
knowledgeable about diamonds, it will be 
harder for a con artist to rip you off. Once 
you know more about diamonds, you will be 
ready to start shopping.

Take your time. Don’t purchase the first 
diamond that you see that interests you. 
Instead, look for similar diamonds for sale. 
Do some comparison shopping to find the 
lowest prices. Once you have found the
lowest price, start doing your investigation. 
You know about diamonds, you’ve found a 
diamond that you love, and you’ve found the 
lowest price – but you are still quite a ways 
away from actually purchasing that diamond!

Ask about the seller’s credentials, such as 
professional jewelry associations that they 
belong to. View and print the seller’s return, 
refund, and upgrade policies. Also inquire 
about additional services, such as settings 
and mountings, sizing, and free shipping. Do 
a search for customer reviews on this 
particular company around the Internet. Also
check with the BBB Online to see if there have 
been any complaints.

Ask for a diamond grading report from an 
independent laboratory such as GIA, HRD, 
EGL or AGS. You should see this before 
making a purchase. Finally, use a reputable 
escrow service for high dollar diamonds – 
preferably one that will have the diamond 
appraised while it is in their possession. The 
seller sends the diamond to the escrow 
service, and you send the money to pay for 
the diamond to the escrow service. The 
escrow service has the diamond appraised, 
sends the diamond to you, and sends the 
money to the seller. This is the surest way to 
protect yourself…again, make sure that you 
use a reputable escrow service!
