How to Spot A Fake Diamond

In this world of advanced technology it is 
almost impossible to simply look at a 
diamond and determine whether it is real or 
not – especially if you don’t know much 
about diamonds. There are some steps that 
you can take to avoid buying a fake diamond,
however.

First, only deal with reputable jewelers, and 
when you find a reputable jeweler, stick with 
them. Avoid buying diamonds or other 
jewelry from jewelers that you have never 
dealt with before in the past. Ask to see the 
certificate for the stone. If no certificate exists, 
walk away. 

Look at the setting that the stone is in. Fake 
diamonds, such as zirconias, are usually set 
in low quality metals. Take a close look at the 
stone. Fake diamonds are not durable – 
natural diamonds, on the other hand, are the 
most durable stone on the planet. Look for 
scratches or nicks. 

After purchasing a diamond, take it to 
another jeweler for appraisal. In fact, take it 
to two or three other jewelers for an appraisal 
to make sure that the appraisals are all fairly 
close. If you find that you have purchased a 
fake diamond, you may be accused of 
making a switch when you return to the store 
of your purchase; therefore, it is important to 
have a certificate for the diamond. No two 
stones are alike.
