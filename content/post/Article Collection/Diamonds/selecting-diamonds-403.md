Selecting Diamonds

Diamonds are graded for certification by 
laboratories using grading criteria. Four of 
these criteria are critical to understand when 
making a diamond purchase or investment. 
Known as the “Four C’s” these criteria are: 
color, cut, clarity and carat.  

Color is the result of the composition of a 
diamond and it does not change. When a 
jeweler is describing the color of a diamond 
they are referring to the presence or absence 
of color in white diamonds. Because a 
diamond with no color allows maximum light 
to pass through, colorless diamonds are 
preferred for their sparkle.

Cut refers to a diamonds reflective quality. 
Most diamonds are cut with 58 facets. The 
brilliance of diamonds is heavily dependent 
on the cut. The different angles and the finish 
of a diamond determine its ability to reflect 
light and cause its brilliance and fire. 
Remember that the cut of a diamond can 
have an impact on its durability as well as its 
beauty. Some cutting faults can make a 
diamond prone to breakage. A diamond 
that is cut too thin can also cause light to 
leak out of the back and the diamond will 
lose some of the sparkle and appear not 
to shine. So, as you can see the Cut is 
probably the most important of the Four C’s.   
 
During the formation process, inner flaws, or 
inclusions occur in most diamonds. The 
number and size of these inclusions 
determine what is referred to as the clarity 
of a diamond. Diamonds that are clear 
create more brilliance and therefore are rarer 
and highly priced. To be considered
“flawless”, a diamond must have no surface 
or internal imperfections visible upon being 
viewed by a skilled diamond grader using 
10 power magnifications.

Carat is the unit of weight by which diamonds 
are measured. One carat is equal to 200 
milligrams. A carat is divided into 100 
segments called points. 150 points would 
equal one and a half carats.  

When you go to the store to make that all 
important diamond purchase, do not be shy!  
Ask questions, get the answers needed to 
make an informed purchase. Shopping for 
certified diamonds enables you to make an 
informed selection. Knowing the “four C’s” 
allows you to comparison shop and purchase 
the best diamond at a fair price.  But, before 
making a purchase, shop around and decide 
what shapes and styles really appeal to you. 
Enjoy your diamond for years to come!
