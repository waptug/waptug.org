What Are Dirty Diamonds?

A dirty diamond is one of two things: a rough 
diamond, or a diamond that hasn’t been 
cleaned in a while. Rough diamonds are 
uncut and unpolished – hence, they are dirty. 
But that type of dirty diamond will soon be 
cut and polished and sitting in a beautiful 
jewel box in a display case. Then someone 
will purchase it, and before long, it will 
become a dirty diamond once again.

Diamonds become dirty. When you wash 
your hands with a diamond ring on, soap 
scum clings to it. When you put on hand 
lotion, it gets grease on it. Shower with your 
diamond earrings or necklace, and again, 
you get soap scum. In one short day, your 
brand new diamond could be dirty!

Purchase an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner the 
same day that you purchase your diamond 
jewelry, and use it every single day, without 
fail. The clarity of the diamond changes 
when the diamond is dirty – it loses its 
sparkle. By taking one minute each day to 
clean your diamond jewelry, you can avoid 
this, and your diamonds will never be dirty!
