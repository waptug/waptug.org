Paintball: the art of retreat

In cases where you encounter a situation where you or your paintball team have to back down and retreat, the following are effective ways to make retreating more effective, if not successful.

Always have a plan b:

When you or your squad needs to move to another position, make sure that this area is far safer as this will be the place where you have to retreat to.  Plan ahead so that you will know the ideal place for you and your team to be.  Usually, good places to retreat are those that provide cover for the team or is a nearer to the other squad units of your team.  It is essential that this area is known by everyone, and all know how to get there.  It is also important that all go there together, when such a need arises.

Fight together, run together:

When it is time to retreat,  retreat all together, retreat as one group.  “All for one and one for all” is the best defense you can have.  Your group’s combined strength is a force to reckon with when under attack.  

Imagine if your team was to run off in various directions, you would be unable to watch and protect each other.  It is difficult to battle the enemy if everyone is far apart, especially if you and your other team mates are safely nestled in their separate areas.

Fire, fire, fire and fire:

The most effective way to break from an attack is to fire back with an enormous amount of paintball ammunition as this will cause the opposing team to hide and protect themselves from your fire.  When the leader of your squad decides to retreat, continue firing all together, hit everything that is moving for about three seconds and then,  retreat! Do not forget to fire back and occasionally turn around to check on anyone who may be firing at you.  Do this as a group.  

Keep in mind that retreats are not an opportunity to duck and cover but to make moves that are strategically important to the group’s welfare.  Therefore, it should be quick.

Exception to the rule

There is an exception to the “fire when retreating rule.”  The act of retreating and not returning any shots is when you or your squad is asked to help your fellow team members.  On this occasion, moving as a unit with speed is still very important.

Retreating is not easy but it could be the best choice you or your group have to keep your team from losing.
