Supplies Needed for the Game of Paintball 

Paintball is a growing game not only in the United States but also in the world. A survey conducted in 2005 has shown that this is the third most popular game in the world. 

The use of equipment to protect the players has earned it a reputation as a safe sport - this is better than football or hockey which have a reputation for causing injuries. 

For people to play this game, it is required that a player wear safety gear at all times. This consists of a helmet, chest pad, gloves, and knee and elbow pads. The guns used are only allowed to have a maximum firing speed of 300 feet per second.      

Anyone who wants to try this game should first buy the necessary equipment which can be purchased at the local sports store or online. A helmet may $20-$90. Since it fogs up due to perspiration, dirt, or paint it would be a good idea to buy a cleaning solution and anti-fog spray as well.

Protective gear for the chest can be bought for less than $30. These come in different colors and will protect the individual should a direct shot hit the body. Pads for the knees and elbows can also be purchased for less than $40 each. 

The most important thing needed for battle is the player’s firearm. This can be handguns to assault rifles. The price of these guns run from $100 to more than a $1,000 depending on the features of the gun. Most of these are semi-automatic and can hold several paintballs before being reloaded.

A crucial part of the game is ammunition. This also comes in different colors and ranges in price from $24- $60. A box contains 2000 rounds - more than enough for one game. The player can also buy grenades to be used against the opponent for almost the same price. It is a good idea to buy a loader that will save time when it is time to reload.  

Paintball as some would say is “better than the real thing”. This thrilling sport keeps the heart pounding and the adrenaline going. Should the person be interested in this game, the first thing that needs to be done is getting the right equipment from the shop and learning the rules. 

After briefing, it is time to suit up, lock and load, and get ready to be in the combat zone.
