5 Paintball Playing Tips on How to Win the Battle

Among the many sports that bring about solidarity and sportsmanship in various competitive activities, paintball ranks third among the most popular and highly stimulating games in the world.

According to the 2005 statistics of Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association International, paintball ranks third, next to inline skating and skateboarding.

This paintball hype is based on the premise that people who love “extreme sports” would most likely use activities that will stimulate adrenaline rush.  Because every players aim is to win the game, they would most likely try to obtain all of the possible pointers and suggestions available just to achieve their goal.

Here is a list of some tips on how to play the game well and prevail in the battle:

1. Establish an optimistic approach

Paintball is, basically, a war game, where players can either win or loose; so there are instances where things may not always conform to the plans of the players. What must be observed is that each player must look at the results in a very optimistic way.

For instance, if a player was not able to win the game, he must accept the fact and identify the areas where he failed to perform, which contributed to his failure.

Remember that there is always another opportunity to win the game.

2. Learn by experience

Every failure is a learning experience: view it constructively as a learning experience. Work on the things that need more consideration and improvement.

3. Never play solo

In order to win the battle, it is better for a player to play on a team rather than playing solo. The concept that there are other players ready to cover up for you is a good indication that you will last throughout the game.

4. Do not hide forever

If you are trying to win the game by avoiding being seen and hit by your opponents, you will also have fewer chances of hitting the opponents. You will never learn the correct strategies needed to win the game unless you come out in the open and take action.

5. Never surrender

Just as in real battle, it is best not to surrender even if the odds of winning the game are probably higher. The point here is to stay in the game as long as you continue to be a “hard target.” 

Winning a paintball game is not so much about how you stay in the game but about how you played the game.
