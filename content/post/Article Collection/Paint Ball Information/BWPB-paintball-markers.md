 Paintball Markers: For Some Gun Down Actions

If you enjoy playing war games on your personal computers or play stations, then you would probably love playing paintball.

Just like the computer-generated war games, paintball is one kind of sport that is worth fighting for. It may sound like a cliché but the fact that paintball generates the same kind of adrenaline rush as fighters; it is the kind of stimulation everybody could have.

No wonder people who are so enjoy the action and adventure of exploratory activities like hunting will enjoy paintball.

The game of paintball would never be complete if it were not for the paintball markers because these markers are the primary tool used to get the game started. 

Paintball markers or paintball guns are the tools used by the players to hit each other: but unlike real guns or toy guns, paintball guns make use of paint balls. These are small balls are known as “gelatin capsules” that contain paint. 

The primary purpose is to shoot the paintball, which travels at a high speed, so that when ball hits the opponent, the gelatin capsule explodes and splatters the paint all over the hit mark (opponent).

Paintball markers are regulated so that the speed and the compression inside are safe enough to play with. This means that in order to avoid serious injury or problems, paintball markers should fire a paintball at an average speed of 91 meters per second.

At this rate of speed, injuries or serious damage will be avoided. Too much speed on paintball markers and paintballs can cause grave injuries to the eyes or the ears. Even with the use of safety measures it is still absolutely necessary for the players to wear helmets or any “head protection”.

When choosing paintball markers, it is important to consider the level of expertise of the player. If the player is a newbie, it is important to use a paintball marker fit for basic operations; then as the player advances in his skills he can choose markers that are appropriate for higher level of action.

It is also important to consider the kind of position the player performs in the game. For instance, front line players should use paintball markers that have a “remote air hose.” These guns are lighter so they increase the player’s pace in the game.

Yes, paintball markers can trigger a good game especially if used by good players.
