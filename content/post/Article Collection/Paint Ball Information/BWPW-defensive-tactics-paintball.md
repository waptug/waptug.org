Defensive Tactics in Paintball

The best offense is having a good defense. This kind of thinking is usually deployed in sports such as basketball or soccer where the team does its best to prevent the other team from scoring especially in a championship match. A team can also use the same tactics in the game of paintball by preventing the opposing force from capturing the flag.

Games start with both sides having limited ammunition. Since the game can last for a very long time, the team should make every shot count. The players should only fire when there is a clear shot rather than not being able to fire when it matters the most.  

Spreading out over a certain area is a good defensive tactic. This is to cover the enemy no matter which direction he may come from.  Should the opposing team see one of your team members, the others who have a better view should neutralize the opponent.  

If in the opening minutes of the game, the team has lost half of its members, the best strategy is to fall back to the base and regroup. A perimeter should be set up to prevent the other team from outflanking the group while patrols can be sent out to search for the enemy.

If a scout has spotted the enemy, the person can take the opponent out. Should there be a group moving towards the base, then go back and tell the others and fight off the enemy with the same number of people. This plan could fail if any of the members of the opposing force escapes the attack and informs the others the location of your base.

The trick in catching the enemy off guard takes camouflage and concealment. Since the guns have a limited range, it is best to wait until the opposing force enters the “kill zone” before any shooting takes place.   

When a firefight takes place, the player’s position has been revealed. Since the enemy will return fire, the person can still survive the enemy’s bullets by getting sufficient cover. 

If this is not feasible, then transferring to a better area is a good idea. The player should inform the others before moving so that the others can give adequate cover.

It takes planning for the play to work. By communicating on the field, the team has a good chance of defending the base then surging forward to kill the enemy or capture the flag.
