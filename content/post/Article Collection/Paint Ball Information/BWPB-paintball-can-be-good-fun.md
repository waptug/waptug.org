Finding a New Way to Workout?  Try Paintball!

There are a growing number of paintball players in the America alone; the number has increased to more than 10 million according to a recent survey taken by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association in 2005. The National Xball League was developed in 2003 and many people became interested. The interest spread to other countries when the NXL celebrity games were televised.

Doctors began noticing the game too and started studying its effects on a person’s health.  Dr. Brian Jacobs, a sports medicine expert from South Bend, Indiana commented in an interview that paintball is a source of cardiovascular exercise and is really good for the heart.  He tried to play the game twice and observe how injuries were acquired and the trauma it could cause to a paintball player.  Codes were developed to categorize the injuries caused by the paintball game such as: E922.5 which is an accidental injury caused by a paintball gun; E985.7, a paintball gun injury which was inflicted on purpose or by accident; and E955.7, is a self-inflicted paintball gun injury.

Regardless of the previous observations, the paintball game provides aerobic benefits and creates a workout option for people who are not always physically active. Some doctors advise patients to try the basics of the game because of its health effects.

According to the American College of Sports Medicine rules, the paintball game provides substantial benefits to the body.  This observation was based on a study that was conducted by Tara Kammel, a fitness expert from Maplewood, Minnesota, who attached heart monitors to fifteen paintball players.  During the paintball game, players reached the maximum level of adrenaline as the heart rate surged up to 69 - 74 per cent and a CO2max level of 57 to 65 per cent.

It might at times be dangerous to play paintball, but if the players follow their physicians’ advice then everyone can enjoy the game.

Play the game where there are safety rules to follow and first aid is available.
Do not play without protective gear for the eyes and neck. Wear loose fitting clothes for flexibility. Get in shape with exercise and eat a balanced diet when preparing to play the game.  

If the game is played for sport, it is a sure way of keeping physically active.  It does not only contribute to the physical well being but to a player’s emotional and intellectual abilities as well.  One recent finding by American researchers says that paintball decreased violence since it is a way to release tension.  Hey workaholics! There’s a new sport in town.
