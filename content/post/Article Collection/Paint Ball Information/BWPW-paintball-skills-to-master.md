3 Paintball Skills to Master and Win the Game

Paintball has consistently prevailed as the fourth major unconventional sport in the U.S. In fact, statistical reports say that there are almost 12 million paintball players worldwide with 104 countries participating in various paintball competitions. This shows that more and more people are enticed to play this game. 

However, it does not necessarily mean that the game is easy. Most of the players contend that they have experienced many trials, hardships, failures, and defeat before they were able to master the game. 

Experts insist that playing paintball, just like the other kinds of sport, needs some skills in order to win the game. These skills are the primary tools that every paintball player must try to learn. Once they have mastered these skills, winning the game is relatively simple.

Here is the list:

1. Basic stance

The problem with most players is that they tend to face the bunker whenever they are standing next to it. This is such a difficult stance because it will give the player inadequate balance and a time-consuming response.

The best way is to stand behind the bunker with the foot that is opposite with the paintball marker or gun in lead. For instance, if a player holds the marker with the right hand, the left foot should be in lead.

2. Trick shot

It is important for every paintball player to know the psychological aspect of the game. This means that the player must know how to think and act appropriately according to the possible actions of the other players.

Therefore, fire some “trick shots” in an area where the other player is probably hiding. It does not necessarily mean that firing too many shots creates advantage. The object of this skill is to create a ploy that will instigate the player to respond in return if ever he is really in that area.

3. Run and Shoot and Run

Like any person in a battle, it is best to master this type of skill in order to achieve the best action and win. 

The problem with most players is that they continue to hide thinking that they can win because they remain invisible to their opponents. The point is that a player can never win if he does not try to eliminate his opponents.

Mastering this skill will definitely give every player an edge over the others.

In every activity, there is an equal skill to master. Mastery of these skills will ensure that the player can win the game.
