Paintball Playing Techniques in Developing a Good Game

Paintball is an exciting game, but unless you know the right techniques in playing the game you can never win the battle.

Paintball is an example of a war and chasing game. Because of its tremendous impact on people who love highly stimulating games, its popularity continues to grow. In fact, according to the 2005 statistical reports of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers International, paintball currently ranks third among the most well liked intense and ultimate sports.

The Concept

Paintball is a kind of stimulation game in which the players are engaged in a battle. The object of the game is based on “survival of the fittest.” Using paintball guns or markers loaded with “gelatin capsules filled with paint,” every player will try to eliminate his opponents. Once the player is hit by the paintball marker, he is automatically removed from the game; therefore, he can no longer participate.

The Playing Techniques

Since paintball is focused on letting an individual or a team obtain an advantage over the other players, it is important to know some of the playing techniques that will enable the player to succeed in winning the game.

Like any stimulation or war games, techniques are important in establishing the right position, the right plan, and the right approach in order to win the game.

Here is a list of some of the playing techniques that every player must know:

1. Invisibility 

This is an important technique when playing paintball because as long as the player remains invisible to his opponents, the more chances he will have of winning the game.

The main concepts of invisibility are: a) motivate the players to play well in the game because they feel good when they are invisible; b) achieve the goal of winning the game because an invisible player is a “tough target” to catch spot ; and c) invisibility initiates comradeship among teammates.

Besides, once a player remains invisible, the longer he can stay in the game.

2. Vision

It is not enough that a player has good camouflage so that he will remain invisible throughout the game. It is also important to obtain tools and devices that would mislead the other players by letting them believe that they have spotted their opponent, but in reality, it was just a ploy.

3. Development

Try to employ movements that would initiate security and clearance from other players that lurk in the area. Stop running or walking every 30 seconds and check to see if the area is clear. 

Using these techniques will definitely ensure the player of winning the game.
