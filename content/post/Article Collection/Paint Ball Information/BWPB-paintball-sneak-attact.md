Paintball Sneak Attack Tactics: The Devious Ploy

Since its inception, paintball has remarkably developed into a global spectacle. Nearly 9.6 million players have participated in the game since 2004.

Its popularity continues to proliferate thereby making it the third place overall “Most Popular Extreme Sport in the World” list. This is based on the statistical reports of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association International in 2005.

Along with its growing popularity are the various tactics that every player must learn in order to win the game. This is so important because, by nature, paintball is a conglomeration of strategy, techniques, skills, and ability to stimulate the mind to think fast and accurate.

In spite of the many tactics that the experts create in order to help players win the game, the sneak attack approach remains the most reliable method in obtaining victory over the opponents. This is because the object of the “sneak attack tactic” is to hit the opponent furtively and sneakily.

To those who want to know how this particular ploy can be executed, here is a list of some tips:

1. Be cool:

With this kind of tactic, your basic goal is to hit the other player without letting him know that you are even in the area. Once you have spotted your opponent, do not immediately shoot; try to relax a little and aim with your best shot. 

Do not move. Movement can only imply presence. Do you not spot your opponent because of his movements?  If you do the same, chances are, he will be able to see you as well.

2. Wait for the perfect timing:

In case you have seen your opponent but the distance between you and your opponent is great, then, it is best to stay calm and quiet.

The idea here is to wait for your opponent to come into your reach; because if you try to shoot early and miss, you might as well come out in the open and tell your opponent to shoot you.

3. Fire at will:

If in case your opponent was able to sense that you near, do not hesitate to start firing. You will have better chance of aiming at and hitting your target because you were the first one to spot him.

Sneak attack works best for people who think before they act. Any madcap will never get any further. The bottom line of this approach is to aim more accurately in order to shoot without letting the other person know you are there.
