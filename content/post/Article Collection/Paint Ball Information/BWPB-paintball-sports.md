Paintball: sports or not?

The rising popularity of paintball games also gave rise to two opposing groups; one considering paintball as a sport while the other one dismissing it as just a pastime and a non-sporting activity.  But is paintball really a sport or just a plain hobby?

Paintball is considered by enthusiasts as one of the most exciting sports in Europe and in at least 40 countries worldwide and is played by both men and women of all ages.

The reason it has been dismissed by many as a non-sport and considered a mere hobby is because of the reality that paintball started as an activity usually played during corporate gatherings.  As a side activity of most company gatherings, paintball served as a pastime for corporate officials who needed to relax after tough corporate duels.  However, those who have tried playing paintball have been stuck by and hooked on the game.  

The reason some people see paintball as a mere hobby or pastime is because of ignorance or lack of knowledge about paintball.  

Most dictionaries define a sport as an activity for individuals or groups which involves physical skill and is governed by a set of rules and is engaged in professionally.  On the other hand, a pastime is seen as something participated in for exercise or for pleasure.  Paintball is both.

While a glimpse of the game gives one the idea that paintball is a macho game and something which gives rise to the “Rambo” image of the male species, it is important to note that paintball is an organized sport.  No one can play the game without training or without the necessary tools and accessories.  Sorry to disappoint you, but paintball is not just for macho males, but also for females who want some “spice” in their lives.

Paintball is a rough game so safety is a prime concern.  Paintball players are required to wear protective clothing like overalls and jackets.  However, like all other sports you must follow all of the safety rules since close range shots can cause bruises and/or hurt the victim.  Some game sites minimize the chances of close range shots to avoid injuries.

If you want to get into a sport which can really get your adrenaline flowing, then try paintball. It is a sport which you can play with friends or with your family.
