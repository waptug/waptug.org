Paintball: it is not a game, it is a cool war

Paintball is a game where there are two groups (teams) of players and each group’s aim is to eliminate the opposite team via shooting paint balls at each other.  

The following are the basic rules in playing paintball.

Follow the referee: 

Paintball should have only one referee for each game.  This referee who will start and end the game as well as stop it (in order to check for paint) and be the decision maker should any problems or game issues arise.  Fortunately or unfortunately, any verdict issued by the referee – as in any other game – is final and cannot be repealed.  

You are out:

A player is no longer in the game if he or she is shot by a paintball marker that cracks or splatters on him or her.  This applies when the marker or pellet breaks anywhere on the player’s clothes, equipment or gun.  Take note that whether the shot came from a fellow teammate or from an enemy,  the marked player is required to call out “DEADMAN” or to yell “OUT” in reference to themselves.  They are required to immediately leave the field using the route that is the safest as well as shortest, all the while calling him self out.

You are in:

If a player is hit by a paintball marker and the marker does not crack or break, that player is still in the game.  A player is also considered in the game if he or she is accidentally splattered by a paintball marker, especially if the splatter is caused by the paintball marker hitting a rock, a bush or tree.  But this rule no longer applies if the player calls him or her self “OUT” or “DEADMAN” even if they have mistakenly thought that they were hit only discover that they were not.  The rule says that they are still required to leave the field using the safest as well as shortest route.

Safety is the best policy

All players are required to wear protective clothing that covers the arms, neck and legs. “T” shirts are not allowed to be worn during the game.  All players must have goggles as well and these cannot in any way, be removed during play.

Paintball is a game of strategy as well as quick thinking.  But just like any other game,  there are rules that need to be observed to make the game not only more challenging, fun, exciting, but most importantly fair.
