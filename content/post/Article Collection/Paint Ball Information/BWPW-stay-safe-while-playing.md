Stay Safe While Playing Paintball

Paintball is an extreme game that has thousands of players nationwide. There are more than ten organizations that sponsor events throughout the country at different venues. Though the inventors of this game created it just for fun, this game has grown. A recent survey has shown that this is the third most popular game in the world. 

Safety is the most important concern for those who want to play this game. This goes from the clothing that should be worn to the types of weapons that can be used.  

Protective equipment consists of a face mask, gloves, pads for the chest, knees and elbows. They must be worn at all times while inside the playing field. It is advisable to wear shoes with rubber soles given the rough terrain where the game is usually played.

Guns should be inspected before being used in any of the matches.  This is because there is a maximum velocity allowed. The paintballs should not travel over 300 feet per second since anything greater can seriously injure the players. 

To prevent a misfiring from occurring, barrel plugs should be used for the safety of the gun owner and the people who are present during the event. 

The facemask may fall off suddenly during the heat of the action. It can also fog due to sweat, paint or dirt. When this happens, the player should call on the referee so that it to be cleaned off of the field. The opponent is not allowed to fire on the player until that person is ready to return to the firing zone.

Since this game is about fun, players are not allowed to curse or hit other players. The only activity allowed is shooting the opponent so that he will be eliminated.

Another safety feature allowed in the game involves giving the opposing player the opportunity to surrender; but should the player show any form of hostile action, then one has no choice but to shoot the opponent.

Aside from protection given to the players, the organizers of such events also put safety nets around the area and require the audience remain a certain distance away from the action to avoid being hit by any of the balls. 

Safety is a primary concern of paintball and almost every other sport: this is why rules are set in place which the players have to abide by. This is done to protect both the players and the fans: to prevent injuries from happening and so that everyone can have a good time.
