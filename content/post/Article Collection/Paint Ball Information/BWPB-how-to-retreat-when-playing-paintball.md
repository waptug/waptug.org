Strategize the Retreat During a Heated Paintball

It hurts when the team realizes that it is time to retreat, but nevertheless there are numerous ways to execute a successful retreat. Here’s how.

Strategize a plan.  The whole team must be ready to go to a safe area if it is necessary to retreat.  Find a place that provides enough cover to protect  yourself.  It would be a good idea to move closer to the assist team members in order to obtain help.  The assist units are usually concealed prior to the start of the game so the opposing team will not have any idea where the players are heading.

Be a team: work together, run together, and fight together.  The best protection is always team power.  Watching each other’s back can save the whole squad as this helps the team re-engage as soon as they’re back in a safe area.

Fire back: to free your selves from the enemy, the team must fire in sync and with great intensity to keep the enemy’s heads down.  This could buy time for you to make a successful retreat.  Three to four seconds of blasting can be good preparation for retreat.

Move with a plan:  to repeat, strategize!  Retreating does not necessarily mean rushing to safety.  While retreating make certain that the opposing paintball players are given a hard time.  The whole squad should take turns in returning fire for cover.  In the end it is surprising to see that there were multiple shots fired at the opposing team while retreating.  They may be running after the retreating team so is it is easy to shoot at enemy when they are in the open.

While there is still room for control, end the retreat: not when the whole team can no longer be shot but when there is still a chance to fight the opponent.  It will be harder when the enemies cannot to be seen because the damage they could inflict is much worse.

The catch!  There are special occasions when a team retreats just to lure the enemies into a trap.  By keeping the paintball team together and drawing back, it might give the opponent the feeling they are already winning and they might be easier to attack.  Once the assisting unit is behind you, utilize speed and shoot the enemies. Ah! The winning moment. 

Being fired at during a paintball game is not to be used as a reason to retreat.  It could be a good chance to change stations and use the advantage for better cover.  It might be good to retreat in order to mess up the enemy’s strategies.
