Winning Paintball as a Team

Paintball is a war game and like in real war, you are never alone. You have your friends fighting beside you and with the same spirit - wanting to win as much as you do.

Paintball is a tactical game. You have to know your team’s strengths and weaknesses. As a rule, it is best to use your team’s strength to win rather than trying to cover up your weaknesses. This does not mean that you will not care about your weaknesses: if you are disadvantaged because of it, then you have other days to learn how to change it. What really matters now is how to prevent the other team from exploiting your weakness and making it a turning point in your battle.

Paintball also requires your team to have a battle plan. Who will be the designated shooter (sniper)? Who will charge and start all the action for your team? These are just two of the different positions and strategies that your team will have to determine so that your team can win. 

Paintball is designed to bring out the creative side in people. You have to make sure that your battle plan allows for a contingency plan for when mistakes happen. You are never really sure how your opponent will react when you stage a certain part of your plan. The sign of a great “general” is knowing the different plans that your opponent will make to counteract every thing you do. A general should not be rattled when every plan he has made has failed. He should be able to devise new plan in the middle of the fight.

Paintball also requires your team to be flexible. Just because you are not a designated hitter does not mean that you cannot do that to your opponents. Your team should understand each others job and make sure that when one of your teammates falls, there are others who can carry on the job he was doing.

Paintball requires good communication between teammates. You should have your own signs and you should learn to bond with your teammates so that you will know what he wants by just a look of the eye or nod of the head.

Paintball is also not just about winning as a team, it is also about experiencing losing as a team and experiencing all of the hardships of playing and surviving as a team. It is in learning as a group and bonding as brothers.
