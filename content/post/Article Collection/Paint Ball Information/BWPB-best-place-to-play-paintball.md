Where to Play Paintball?

There are various types of paintball fields that offer a challenge and excitement to players. Paintball fields add to the overall enjoyment of the sport.

Woods

“Woodsball” as it is referred to by a lot of paintball players is the “purest” type of setting where paintball is played.  On this type of field, players get the feel of the real war game.

Basically, the field is a secluded area in the woods which has an open area.  Players “hare”, learn stealth or how to advance the field in a very sneaky manner. 

Concept Fields

The concept field is often created outdoors, with many objects that have been set up for players to take refuge in or seek protection from.  Usually concept fields have a theme, the most common of which is the urban city setting with cars, buildings and many other city elements. 

There are some fields that are very creative with their themes, such as medieval themes with castles which have towers, wagons and cutouts of people.  Concept fields are interesting and fun: players are able to adjust the skill level of the group by removing or adding obstacles.

Speedball Fields

According to paintball fanatics the most exciting and challenging of all fields are the speedball fields. They are made up of equally spaced and equally sized barriers. 

The challenge here is that a player can not see past the huge barriers and can bump into or encounter anyone at any time.  With the smaller barriers a player can be concealed one way, yet revealed to another player.

Indoor Fields

These fields offer a much different approach and encounter from an outdoor field. The first and major thing that new players encounter is that here paintball guns are very loud: some find that the sound hurts their ears so they wear earplugs; but this is not necessary most of the time.

Indoor fields are generally found in cities where there is a lack of open areas to play the game. Similar to outdoor fields, indoor arenas also offer a variety of themes and set ups. The range is considered to be the major difference. 

A team with great team effort is the key to the game of paintball regardless of where you play - the basic paintball idea remains the same. The option is up to you:  select a field that fits your interests and your performance level the best.  Paintball fields are as diverse as one’s imagination.
