Do you know where to shop for paintball gear?

There are many online shops as well as retail stores all over the country that sell and offer paintball guns, markers, as well as anything and everything that relates to the game of paintball.

One shop that can be accessed online is paintballgun.com.  This online store is unique in its own way because this shop is operated, built and run  by players of paintball.  

They have solid as well valid ideas what paintball players need and/or want to have. They also have a number of years of experience in the paintball industry.

Usually, items ordered thru paintballgun.com are shipped immediately - in as little as twenty four to forty eight hours.  

Believe it or not,  paintballgun.com offers a thirty day guarantee so that you can get your money back if you are in any way dissatisfied with their product.  Just make sure that all merchandise purchased, whether new or used, is returned using the same packaging in which it was originally received.

A one year warranty is provided to all and /or any parts of items purchased, as well as an extended warranty on all guns purchased.  

The catalogues they provide are also available online.  This is one of the reasons they are able to keep their prices low since printing is expensive and takes longer than posting item details on the net.   Also, their prices are updated online and they try –as much as possible – to lower their prices for you.

Currently, any items purchased through their online store can be paid for using credit cards such as Master Card, Visa, Amex and Discover.

They also accept checks and are also utilizing the online service of  Paypal.
All items purchased from paintballgun.com  are one hundred percent insured. 
Just make sure that you keep on record the number of the invoice, the tracking number and any damage the item might have incurred during shipping when you call the department that handles claims at paintballgun.com.  

Another online shop that sells paintballs is Xtremez Wholesale.  They are the source of most items found in paintball shops that are found across the country.  However, their focus is on special paintball as well as Airsoft retail stores.  

Their trade shows are a perfect venue to display their products, making it easier for you or anyone to directly make that one essential purchase in one shop, conveniently and easily, rather than going to many others.  

There are many paintball stores but it may be easier to locate and purchase goods online thru the internet.  All one has to do is seek and surely you will definitely find!
