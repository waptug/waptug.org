Real estate investments are often termed as hot investments and if done right, they can really yield high returns and that too very quickly. Prudential is a popular name in the world of investments. Prudential financial companies are spread throughout the world and offer wide range of financial services including real estate services (which are also known as Prudential real estate services or just Prudential real estate brokerage services). Prudential real estate network is quite large.

Prudential real estate services start with a tool for finding a home. Enabled by the vast Prudential real estate network, the Prudential real estate home finding service provides you with thousands of listings from various states in the US. This is one wonderful service that also provides you with the access for the multiple listing service in the area of your choice (you need to register for that on the website of Prudential real estate services; this registration is free). Using this service, you can even save homes in your portfolio (i.e. save the details of your choice of homes in your portfolio) and later comeback and view them. You can even request an online home tour. Besides this home finding Prudential real estate service, you can use another service called “Find a neighbourhood service”. Using this Prudential real estate service, you can determine not only the average costs of houses in a particular locality (and you can choose any locality by giving its zip code or postal address) but also things like schools in that area (with full details) and also other demographic, lifestyle details of the area. Prudential real estate goes even further with providing you with a service that automatically provides you updates for homes that match your profile. These updates are provided through email and are based on the profile that you provide to Prudential real estate at the time of registering on their website. Prudential real estate also provides you with guides and tips for buying and selling homes. These guides can help you in enhancing your understanding about real estate and hence aid you in decision making. Prudential real estate services also include relocation services, real estate investments, commercial mortgages and commercial properties.
