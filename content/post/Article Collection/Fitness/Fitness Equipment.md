Be Lean, Mean:  Tips for Buying those Fitness Equipment Machines

How do you regularly stay fit, healthy and flexible?  A hale and hearty diet of nutritious fruits and vegetables is the key as well as regular and continuous exercise.  

The best exercise is one that you are really and sincerely going to be working out on, be it push-ups, stretches, jumping jacks or the regular jogging or the much tamer walking.  However, there are people who prefer to work out using fitness equipment in their own homes. 

The following are a few basic and important things to consider when buying those exercise equipments.

Do not believe what you see and hear

At least not everything,  it is good if you assess all those claims exercise equipments declare in their advertisements.   It is so hard to accept as true for example some statements that assure people that they will lose several pounds off their weight in as little as seven days or that you will decrease your pants size in one month.  Even with the assistance of dietary supplements, it is not possible to accomplish changes as major as these in just a few weeks, much less days.

Fat Burner is a No Burner

Be skeptical about claims that say you will be able to burn a tremendous amount of fat in a specific area of your body, such as the hips, thighs, waist just by applying a specific type of ointment or lotion, etc.  The only sure way to burn all those fat way is by changing what you eat. Exercise is the best solution to works out every area of the body whose fat you want to get rid of.  

The only testimonial that counts is yours

Before and after pictures of people who claim that they were able to lose weight because of using such and such equipments may or may not be true.  If ever they are,  their experience is purely personal and that is no assurance that your unique body weight, body make-up will also undergo the same change they went through.  

Read the fine print

It is always advisable to read the fine print of anything.  Though you believe that the fitness equipment you are planning to purchase is a good one, reading the fine print really wouldnâ€™t hurt as it may say that you also have to decrease your calorie intake and not just rely on what the machine could do for you.

Do the math

There are advertising statements that say you could pay off the fitness equipment in a number of easy payments or by paying a mere thirty nine ninety five a month.  Do not forget to inquire about shipping and handling costs and include that in your calculation.  Also, add-on the required sales tax, delivery fees, set-up fees.  Know all the details before you purchase.  

Guarantee the warranty

It is best that you consider asking about details on their thirty day money back guarantee.  Though this could sound good to you as the consumer, it may or may not actually do you good if for example you are going to return the item.  You may actually pay for the humongous shipping cost and it could cost you more than what you could guarantee to receive in thirty days.

Call customer service
	
Make sure you contact their customer service hotline.  Usually, they have toll-free numbers that you must be able to easily contact as well as a customer service representative who must be glad to be able to take your call and answer thoroughly all or any questions you may have about their products and services.
