Geocaching is an excellent way to maximize your use of a handheld auto navigation system. There are so many wonderful activities and events you can use your system for and geocaching is a way of combining many activities into one use or event. In addition to being a great way to get out and see the world this is a great way to work physical fitness into your fun regimen. The reason is that there is generally some degree of work involved in finding your hidden treasures. 

So what exactly is geocaching? Glad you asked. This is a sport really, kind of like a fox hunt without the dogs and foxes. Seriously, it is a merry chase in search of a small token or treasure. The idea is that you take something, leave something, and make a note about it in the log. You use your GPS or handheld auto navigation system in order to find the treasure you are seeking. You find the caches and stashes by getting the coordinates from the Internet. This is a very popular pastime and you will find all kinds of spectacular prizes and goodies in the cache stash as well as phenomenal flops when it comes to prizes as well. All bets are off really, some stashers leave great goodies and others leave pranks or silly items. It is completely up to you which treasures you will leave behind (do keep in mind that this is often a family activity and keep your tokens family friendly as people of all ages enjoy the sport).

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to geocaching and new games are created all the time to keep the fun alive and the sport much more interesting. Check the Internet for caches hidden in your area, you might be amazed at the vast number of treasures and treasure hunters that live near by. I always have a tendency to think of geocaching as my own form of treasure hunting. Not all caches are created equal but the thrill of the hunt is really what it's all about. There have been some incredibly zany and humorous caches in addition to the wonderful stashes of actual cash. Enter into this with the idea of having a lot of fun and you might be surprised at all the wonderful gifts and goodies you find. Be sure however to always leave something behind if you take an item. 

Don't be deceived by the fact that you are using GPS or other auto navigation systems in order to find the stash, you may find yourself getting quite the orienteering workout. Not only will you need to climb, hike, or bike on occasion you may need specialized equipment such as scuba equipment or rock climbing equipment in order to reach some caches. You may even begin your own cache by finding a creative location in which to stash your trinkets and treasures and loading the coordinates to your local geocaching website. If you keep an eye on your stash you may find all manner of interesting goodies and ideas coming through. 

Even if you haven't really considered how exciting it would be to go on a real treasure hunt since you were a child, isn't it about time you did? Geocaching is the modern day treasure hunt with a twist-rather than "X" marking the spot, you will find your way with beeps and blips.
