**10 Tips For Web Success**

by:

**Michael Scott McGinn**

**The webmaster’s biggest job is to get their traffic up and keep
customers/visitors coming back. Building the site is one thing, but simply
building and posting a website does not guarantee traffic. In fact, a website
could be beautiful and an example of all the latest technology and still not
attract a single visitor if not promoted correctly. Here are 10 tips to guide
you to success with your website.**

**The internet is a new medium.**

1.  At least compared to print, it is. A website is a waste if it simply
    re-hashes something which could easily be put into print. Don’t have the
    site be just an online brochure. Put up features which take advantage of the
    internet as a medium of communication. Filter information for them. Provide
    search capability. Provide interactivity with features like forums, quizzes
    and tools. Web visitors like to interact.

**Treat the Customer’s Time as Valuable.**

2.  When a person visits your website, you have their attention for that point
    in time. You either need to use it or you will lose it – fast. Most visitors
    have short attention spans, what you need to design your site homepage so
    that it grabs their attention and provides what they are looking for right
    away. Its like walking into a restaurant. If you walk in and just stand
    there and nobody comes to greet you, you might wonder what is happening.
    But, if the hostess comes and greets you right away and walks you to a
    table, then you will be there for awhile and eat. The same analogy goes for
    websites. Don’t overcomplicate your website homepage. Best results will be
    obtained if you make it very clear where to click to find what they need.

**Design the site for customers, not the company.**

3.  Your site needs to satisfy the needs of customers, not the company. So,
    don’t post content which is not really useful to the site’s customer. And
    avoid over-flattering marketing hype about the company. It inflates the ego
    of the company more than it helps your customer.

**Involve the Visitor.**

4.  Keep the visitor involved and make them feel like a valuable contributor.
    Actively ask for the feedback and suggestions. Ask for communication from
    your visitors and answer that communication swiftly. When getting that
    communication, capture their email address. This will allow you to
    communicate with them long after they have moved on and forgotten about you.

**Keep it Current.**

5.  You need to have content on your website which is timely and relevant to the
    customer’s life. Posting month-old news is not interesting. Posting dry
    product information which never changes is not interesting. Yes, you need to
    have product information and other information on your site that won’t
    change much, but you can also post more timely content. You can, for
    example, post content about how your products can be used in certain
    situations in life. Provide tips and techniques – things which are
    immediately applicable and solve a problem.

**Pay Attention to Form/Design.**

6.  Some sites simply over-do it on the eye-candy. Big graphics just for the
    sake of graphics often impress the site’s designer more than the visitor. Do
    not use graphics that are large and purposeless. Remember, some visitors may
    still be accessing your website via dial-up. Your site needs to load up
    quickly for all users. A slow website will cause your users to leave
    quickly. Also, pay attention to graphic and design size. Many web designers
    operate on fairly large screen resolutions and sometimes forget that even
    though a graphic looks great to you, it will appear enormous to somebody on
    a smaller resolution. On the flip side, don’t go too light on graphics. A
    site which is poorly designed and using the default font and no color is not
    very aesthetically pleasing. Any web visitor, whether they admit it or not,
    judges your company by your website unless they have something else to go
    on. A well-designed site communicates professionalism. A poor design makes
    the site seem like an afterthought.

**Promote.**

7.  When a visitor communicates to you via email, it is best to use a web form.
    not only will this keep your email address from being picked up by spammers,
    it will also allow you to ask your customers for their email address and
    then store that address for later use. Employ the “push/pull” marketing
    strategy. A visitor coming to your website is the pull, but later you want
    to push content back to them in the form of a newsletter or other
    promotional material. Start a mailing list and use it. Invite visitors to
    sign up. Promotion makes or breaks a business, and as long as you respect
    the ethical considerations of your mailing list, you should use it.

**Don’t Operate in a Cocoon.**

8.  The internet is a medium which is shared by millions. When you set up your
    website, don’t operate as if you are a self-contained island. Get out there
    and keep in tune with what is happening on other websites related to your
    own. Participate in forums. Post links to other websites and ask for a link
    in return. Form partnerships with other sites if it is appropriate. When it
    comes to communication, people like personal contacts. Hiding behind general
    email address like “sales” and “info” is OK as long as there is a way to
    also email you directly. A company site which allows email direct to the
    management is good. Just remember how much you hate calling a company and
    getting stuck in their phone system. Sometimes you just want to talk to
    somebody. Give your visitors that ability.

**Have a Plan to Attract Repeat Traffic.**

9.  Use newsletters, out-going email, contests, forums, clubs, auctions –
    anything that will cause people to return to your website. When posting
    links to other websites, don’t just send your visitors somewhere else. They
    may never return. Provide them an exit page. Give them a pop-up when they
    try to leave your site. Or at the very least make external links open in a
    new window.

**Track Your Visitors**

10.  Pay attention to your site’s statistics and react accordingly. What are
    people reading? How are they finding you? Do they just come and leave right
    from your homepage? How long as they are on your website? Do they return?
    This data is immensely valuable in fine-tuning your website based on
    customer needs and wants. Remember, the biggest mistake of any webmaster is
    designing the site for what THEY want. A successful website is designed for
    the target audience, not to impress the site’s owner.
