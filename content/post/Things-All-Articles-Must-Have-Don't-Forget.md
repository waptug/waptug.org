�	Keywords and Keyword Phrases. 

An article must always be centered on the keywords and keyword phrases.

�	Keyword Density

Know that you have your keywords and keyword phrases, you must use them fully. An article must have good keyword density for a search engine to �feel� its presence.

Getting a high rank is what articles do best for a site. 

Keyword density is the number of times a keyword or keyword phrase is used on an article. The number varies depending on the number of words used in an article.

It comes off as overeager. A low number may be ignored by the search engines.

�	Linking Articles
