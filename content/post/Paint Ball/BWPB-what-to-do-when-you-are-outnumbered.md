There are a few things you could do when you are outnumbered during a game of paintball.  The first - do not panic.  The second,  you must think � it is just a game. Or is it?

The first thing to do is to select a team leader.  After that is done, it is the leader that teammates must rely on when quick decisions have to be made.  

The following are basic things that can be done when you or your team feels that they have been outnumbered in paintball.

Be on the defense:

Make sure that all of your team mates are placed near the boundary of the field so that the opposing team will have little chance to sneak up on you.  Next, designate one to three players to patrol the field (the number depends on your team�s size). Ask them to patrol around the field, specifically looking for an enemy and taking that enemy out. In case they notice a group of the opposing team, and this group does not notice them,  this small patrol team must immediately go back and advise the rest of the team the location of the enemy. 

The squad:

Make sure that if any enemy force is notice, and this force is the size of a squad, a similar sized squad should be dispatched to face the opposing team.

Lure them out:

The patrol should be sent out to attract the opposing team and entice them to be defensive.  However, there is a risk when doing this as there is a possibility that a member of the opposing team could escape and be able to warn his own team mates. It is also a possibility that it might not happen, and victory could just as well be yours.

Ignore the enemy:

You could also make the choice to pretend that you have not seen the opposing enemy.  The idea is that, if they did not see you, you are not a threat to them.

Get together everyone:

Make sure to gather all members of your team together then carefully, cautiously move up the side of the field that you think is less likely to be utilized by the opposing team.  When you are there, try to hunt the enemy force and strike the opposing team from that side.

Basically, the best thing to do when outnumbered is to relax.  This makes thinking easier and the action clearer.
