Is there validity to comparing in-house work and outsourced work? Of course
there is but the more pertinent question is how you make these comparisons.
Those who are involved in the Internet niche marketing industry realize a large
portion of their success is related to their ability to constantly evaluate
their niche markets and determine what is working and what is not working. They
examine and test aesthetical details such as font size and colors along with
more technical elements such as coding and search engine optimization (SEO)
strategies. Since these savvy entrepreneurs are already constantly evaluating
and making minor adjustments it is logical that they should also make
comparisons relating to the work done in-house and the work that is outsourced.
They should evaluate the work in terms of finances and in terms of quality.

The Cost of Outsourcing vs. Keeping Work in House

As with any business the bottom line in Internet niche marketing is often
financial. There is no clear cut answer as to whether particular tasks will be
completed at a lower cost in-house or through outsourcing. This will depend on a
number of factors. For example the qualifications of the in-house staff is one
of the major factors in the equation. The availability of the in-house staff
members should also be considered.

If there are members of in-house staff members capable of completing the task
and available to do so, it may be more affordable to keep the work in-house.
However, outsourcing does reduce labor costs but often comes with a higher
hourly rate as well as costs required to advertise the position and interview
candidates. These costs will vary from case to case so it is important to always
consider outsourcing as an option when possible.

The Quality of Outsourcing vs. Keeping Work in House

Comparing the quality of outsourcing versus in-house work is even more
difficult. Again, there is no set answer for which is typically higher quality.
In a situation where experts are required to complete a task it may be better to
outsource the task because the in-house staff is not qualified to complete the
task. In this case the quality of the work produced by the contractor will not
only be of higher quality but will also likely be completed quicker and more
efficiently.

However, in cases where the in-house staff and the contractor are equally
qualified the in-house staff may hold a slight advantage because they are more
familiar with company policies and procedures. In this case the in-house may be
more efficient because they are already familiar with the standard procedures.
This becomes less of an issue in cases where work is outsourced to the same
individual regularly.

The other factor to consider when comparing outsourced work to in-house work is
the work ethic of the individual completing the assignments. Two equally
qualified employees given the same assignment, schedule and pertinent
information may not produce the exact same results. This is because one employee
may have a more diligent work ethic and a more keen attention to detail. In this
scenario the more diligent employee will likely produce work of a higher
quality. As this relates to personality rather than whether or not the work is
completed in-house or outsourced it makes it even more difficult to compare
in-house work to outsourced work.
