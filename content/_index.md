Welcome to my HUGO blog with some of my work in progress. I've been working on building sites using the static site building framework called Hugo. This site is a collection of articles I have posted. You can read some of the chapters below. Feedback is requested.  If your interested in ReactJS visit my ReactJS profile page at https://michaelscottmcginn.com.   If your interested in WordPress then visit my WordPress site at https://waptug.com. If your in need of a hosting solution please visit my hosting site at https://geekzonehosting.com. If you are interested in RaspberryPi Computers and would like to meet others who are interested in them then visit https://warpjams.com.

Enjoy your stay here. Share some stuff if you find it is helpful.

Thanks

Michael Scott McGinn
