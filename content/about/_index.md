_A group of developers learning with each other_ (English: _United States of America_) Launched in 2009 while attending college. We formed a student club that wanted to build a cloud system out of some donated servers for a club project. We wanted to host our own web server so we could post our example projects so thay would last after we left college. When I graduated in 2012 we had gotten the server room built but faced resistance from administration to get them live. After I left college I kept the domain name and have been using it as a experimintation site. Looking back on the college experience and being proud that the club existed in various forms many years after I left is a nice accomplishment. This site your reading is built using Markdown and the Hugo static site builder system (https://gohugo.io). See our sister site at https://waptug.com where we are building a Learning Management System (LMS) using ReactJS and WordPress. This site is hosted on my home server and connected to the internet via DynDNS over my Comcast cable internet connection.  This is running on a hp pavilion Intel Core i5 laptop and will soon be migrated to a RaspberryPi 4 (with 8GB ram/32GB HD) linux server.
